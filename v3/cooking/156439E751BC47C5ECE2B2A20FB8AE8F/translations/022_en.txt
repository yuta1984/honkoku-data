One cup of regular rice flour, one cup of sake, one cup of soy sauce, one cup of miso, half a cup of vinegar - a total of six ingredients. Additionally, add daikon radish and dried bonito flakes. Use water as you would for cooking regular rice, add the chicken mentioned above, and be sure to put your hand in - the water level should reach up to the back of your hand. Cook the rice slowly until all the water for the chicken rice is absorbed, and use it after it has simmered down. Duck or wild goose may also be used instead. The broth should be made slightly sweet. Season according to the previous instructions. Although there are other chicken rice recipes, since they are generally known by cooks, they are not recorded here.

Method for Miso-Marinated Birds
Take any of the following: wild goose, dove, quail, skylark, duck, snipe, or white heron. Remove all feathers, take out the innards from the belly, wash thoroughly, let the moisture dry for a while, then place in the miso and press down firmly. After five or six days, remove and use as: grilled bird, with pepper, in soup, as a flat dish, or as a raised dish - leave it to the cook's discretion. It can also be used for sashimi. However, it's good to add syrup to the broth.

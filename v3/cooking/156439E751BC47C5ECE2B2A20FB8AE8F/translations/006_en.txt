is not rich. The old man Kitodō is well-versed in this culinary art,
when he takes up the kitchen knife, he follows rules; when adding salt and soy sauce, he uses established methods.
His seasoning (anbai) is never wrong. The old man devoted himself to this way,
recording rare things and describing extraordinary ones. His disciples collected these
to make a secret box. What makes it secret are the measurements
of quantities; what makes it esoteric are the flavor adjustments. These are
the difficult aspects of this art. Someone at the study asked whether to open
the lid of this box now. I said, "Do so. When stored away,
it's not even worth counting on one's fingers, but when opened, there's no time
to take up the abacus. Why not open it? Very well,
open it" - that's all I say.

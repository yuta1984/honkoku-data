black sesame seeds to put in, or boil green beans, peel them, and put in fourteen or fifteen, or
put in roasted adzuki beans. However, if making tempura, mix strained sweet bean paste with
miso and put it in. For this preparation, make the aforementioned miso in a tea bowl,
rolling it around like charcoal briquettes, wrap it in the ground fish meat,
put cloth into water, wrap the ground fish meat, and
prepare it in the shape of chakin (tea cloth bundle),
add a little kudzu starch, heat water, and put it in -

for flat plate dishes, put it in straight from the hot water. For tempura,
remove from water, dry it, and deep-fry in oil.

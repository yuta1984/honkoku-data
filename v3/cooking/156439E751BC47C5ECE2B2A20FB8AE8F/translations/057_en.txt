fold together and tie well, put in a steamer, steam thoroughly, remove, put in water to cool, then split open at the bamboo joint. When reheating this, put it back in the steamer. Usage is the same as before. The cross-section looks like the seasoned tube egg.

　　　Vinegar-Poached Egg Method
First, crack eggs carefully so the yolks don't break. Boil about 5 go of water in a pot, add one soup bowl full of sake, remove the lid and bring to a boil. Drop eggs in one by one, and when they float to the surface, place them one by one on medium plates. Sprinkle a little white sugar on top, then drizzle high-quality vinegar, place a little to the side, and serve. Too much vinegar is bad. This is especially good for tea cuisine.
　　　Egg and Loach Method
First, crack about twenty eggs into a large bowl and beat them thoroughly. Add one go of aged sake and mix well. Then quickly add 2-3 go of loach, immediately cover with a lid, and let sit for about half an hour.

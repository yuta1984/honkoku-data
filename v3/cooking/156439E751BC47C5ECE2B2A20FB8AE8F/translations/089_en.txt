it becomes like this, but later it spoils easily. Do this for about three days in winter, then soak in finest aged sake for one day and night. It is best to use plenty of sake. Then remove it, wrap as-is in fresh straw, make it into a bundle, and hang it in a place where rain and wind do not reach. When using it around the second or third month of spring, take out the carp, soak it in warm water for a while, then remove it, and when the carp is placed in water and becomes somewhat soft, cut the whole fish into round slices, add a little sake to thin miso soup, and simmer gently. The ways to use this in cooking are: first, for tea bowl dishes, lay down sansho miso and serve. Second, for soup dishes, cut thinly and add one piece along with any other ingredients. Third, for sashimi, fillet into three pieces, cut into rounds and layer - this also makes a good serving for individual portions. Fourth, use a large platter with five-colored paper as underlining, layer the carp cut into rounds, pile them up, place the tail upright on top, and serve as the main dish for the middle seating at celebrations like shichi-go-san. ○This cold-season carp is medicine for vital energy for both men and women. This may be what is called "roku-roku fish."

When grilled this way, the eel's flavor becomes exceptionally good, and it becomes as tender as wheat gluten.

Method for Making Eel Kamaboko
1. Use a quite large eel with little fat content. Split it and wash well. Add a little mustard powder and sake to water, and soak the eel in this mixture for about half an hour (approximately 1 hour). Then take it out and wash with fresh water. If the fat is difficult to remove, change the water many times until the fat is completely gone. Place it on a cutting board, hold the knife flat, and gently pound it. Then prepare it like hamo (pike conger eel) and add salt. At this time, add a little white sugar and sake, and the white flesh of the eel will emerge and can be ground well. Then attach it to a board and prepare it like regular kamaboko. It can be used in clear soups, miso soups, or proper soup dishes. For appetizers, form into white dumplings, blanch in hot water, skewer them, and grill with sansho pepper soy sauce.

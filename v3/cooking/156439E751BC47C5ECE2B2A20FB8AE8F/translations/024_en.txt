Method for Crane
First, the main soup should be miso clear soup, the second soup should be jinta clear soup. This is to appreciate the fragrance of the crane. First, for small ingredients, use what is appropriate for the season.
No garnish for the mouth. Also, for clear soup, use something called "sube."
For preparation, singe the feathers, scrape off the oil well with a bamboo edge, repeat this process many times until the oil stops coming out, then plunge into water to cool, and afterwards wash thoroughly and cut into thin pieces.

Method for Preparing Wild Goose
First, main soup and second soup, miso or clear soup. First, use both large and small ingredients. Also use raw salt. Use seasonal ingredients. For mouth garnish, always use citrus varieties. First, wild goose namasu (vinegared dish). Cut the meat thin, arrange on thin serving trays with kai-shiki presentation, pile high, add ginger vinegar and serve. Also, cut wild goose thigh meat thin, bring water to a boil, quickly blanch to set the color, add julienned ginger, mix well, change the vinegar once, then dress again with vinegar. It is also good to sprinkle with poppy seeds, or kusumi, or Japanese pepper. This thigh meat is called "momoke" in cooking terminology.

Chapter 5: How to prepare snow using eggs
1. Put a little water in a pot, and add only egg whites
   (note: "a little" means the white of one egg). When you
   boil this while stirring, pure white foam will form. Using a perforated
   metal ladle, transfer this into another container while
   storing it, and from one egg white you can obtain about
   half a basket's worth of snow-like substance.

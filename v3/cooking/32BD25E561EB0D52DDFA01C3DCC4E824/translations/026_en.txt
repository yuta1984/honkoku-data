When the surface becomes dry, dig into the center and set up a bamboo screen,
pour the liquid accumulated in the screen back on top. After about twenty days,
when there is no more liquid accumulation, this is called "koai" (small mixing) - pound the aforementioned miso
well in a mortar and return it to the original tub, cover with
umbrella paper and place small stones here and there as weights. After seventy-
five days it will mature. Miso aged for two to three years is
exceptionally good.

Matikane (Can't Wait)
When making the koai of the aforementioned red miso, lay rice bran at the bottom.
If the red miso is not used up, this miso cannot be used,

put rice bran in it and attach a string, then put it into the red miso
during the koai process. After a hundred days, pull it out with the string and use.

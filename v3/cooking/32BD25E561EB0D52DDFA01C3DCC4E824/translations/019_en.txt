Cover with a lid and tie well with dried gourd strips, add

　　　Fuki-age (Fluffy Fish Cake)
Thin fish paste with bonito broth, add plenty of
ground potato, season with roasted salt, and prepare in a pot.
When it becomes fluffy and rises to the top, bring it out in the pot
and eat. Adding egg to soy sauce
is also good. Follow your heart.

　　　Sardine Soup
Prepare clear soup with bonito broth, and add
large pieces of daikon radish. Wash red sardines well and add them.
However, when cutting and adding sardines, it's better to add them late. If added
early, they become too salty and unpleasant.

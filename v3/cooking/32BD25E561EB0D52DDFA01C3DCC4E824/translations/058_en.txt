Dozou-ni (Storehouse-style Braised Fish)
Whether using sea bream or crucian carp, if using sea bream, make cuts and skewer it, then grill it white without burning. Add a little Japanese pepper to miso, thin it with kudzu dissolved in water, and apply it thickly enough that the fish cannot be seen. Grill evenly without burning, then rub the surface roughly with the cut end of straw to create texture. Add a little soy sauce to sake in proper proportion and simmer. Perhaps it got this name because the miso doesn't fall off.

Rikyu-sho (Rikyu Sauce)
Two sho of whole barley grains, coarsely ground and soaked in water for about four days. Wash well, roast soybeans and remove skins, then split in half. Rub against the bottom of a measuring cup to remove skins, then wash thoroughly. Steam and allow koji mold to develop. Then dry thoroughly, sift the koji through a winnowing basket, then sift again through a sieve to remove the mold. Dry for another day. One and a half sho of white koji, one and a half sho of high-quality sake, one and a half sho of high-quality soy sauce. Mix the sake and soy sauce well...

Make it into this.

Eggplant Miso
Chop eggplants and pickle them in first-grade soy sauce mash with plenty of koji added. Pickle around July-August and use around November (frost month).

Pickled Plums
Add 5 go of salt to 1 sho of plums, place weights on top, and frequently turn them over. When the plum vinegar rises to the top, dry the plums in shade for a day and a half, put them in a jar, and sprinkle salt on top. Use the aforementioned plum vinegar, remove the plum skins and add them. Sprinkle a little over 2 go of salt, wash plenty of shiso leaves on top, shade-dry until there is no moisture, place like a lid on top of the aforementioned plums, sprinkle 2 go of salt on top and gently press down with chopsticks. It is bad to put your hands in; keep the chopsticks free of moisture and remove moisture with anything. Place under the shiso for pickling. When it becomes submerged, add salt little by little. Leave the wheat gluten as is.

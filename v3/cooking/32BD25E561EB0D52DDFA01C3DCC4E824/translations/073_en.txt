Take only the flesh of pickled plums and mix in sugar, then spread this on shiso leaves. Add hemp seeds one by one and small amounts of apricot, then roll up. Cut into pieces about 5-6 bu in length, sprinkle with sugar for pickling, and set aside. Use after the sugar has thoroughly penetrated the flesh.

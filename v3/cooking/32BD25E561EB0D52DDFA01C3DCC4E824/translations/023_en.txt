Hana-shio (Flower Salt)
One shō of salt, one shō and five gō of water. Make on windless days during the doyō period. Dry the salt well, then
grind it finely in a mortar, put it in a bag made of fine silk, and pour
one shō and five gō of water over it to strain. If straining is not finished,
pour more water from below to continue straining. From morning to evening,
place the salt water in a large bowl
in a place that won't be in shade, being careful not to let it tilt.
After midday, bubbles will rise from the bottom. Pick these up with chopsticks
and place them on a tray. This is flower salt. From one shō of
salt, only about two gō can be made. This is different
from the flower salt made from roasted salt.

Pick plenty of flowers and put them in. When the bulk of flowers
reaches about one shaku (30cm), press it down to three to four bu (9-12cm). Cut
the compressed mass into appropriate pieces,
wrap each piece in high-quality Mino paper, then
pickle from above and below with red miso, place heavy weights on top,
and take out one package at a time as needed. However, after picking the flowers,
sprinkle with salt and press firmly with heavy weights.
The salt water that comes out should be
discarded repeatedly.

pickling.

　　Another method　　Using high-quality white non-glutinous rice, wash many times
with water, dry it somewhat, sift through a silk sieve,
knead with water to make it somewhat firm, take small portions and flatten them,
arrange in a steamer and steam. Once steamed, remove
and pound well. After pounding well, shape into regular chimaki
form, wrap in bamboo leaves, and tie tightly.
If the wrapping is loose, the binding marks will not set properly.

One shō (about 1.8 liters) of white rice makes about 40-50 chimaki.
　(67) Asaina-maki　Using the finest glutinous rice, wash once
with water, soak in camellia lye for about two and a half hours, then steam
in a steamer to make mochi, which will turn yellow. Shape this into regular
chimaki form, wrap with straw pith,
then wrap the top also with straw pith in the usual manner, boil briefly in hot water
and use.

Add liquid until just covered and simmer over charcoal fire. As the cooking liquid reduces, add the mixed liquid mentioned above and continue cooking until everything becomes uniform. However, while cooking:

One: Ground dried plum flesh - a little
One: Plum kernels with skin removed and ground - a little
One: Dried Japanese pepper soaked in hot water, shells removed from inside and finely chopped - a little

These three ingredients can be added in any amount according to taste. Then roast well to dry, cool thoroughly, and pack tightly into a jar for storage.

○Quick-Pickled Herring Roe
One: Put herring roe in a cloth bag and soak in flowing river water. It will pickle well in one day, the smell will be removed, it will have good texture, and excellent flavor. Pickling in sake lees this way is also good. Alternatively, put one cup of water and one-third sand in a bucket, press down the herring roe to pickle, and it will pickle well in one day and night. Wash the sand very thoroughly

so that not even a little sand remains, then use in cooking.

○How to Remove Saltiness from Miso Soup
One: For any fish soup where the fish is too salty, or when the miso is too salty, if you dilute with water the miso becomes thin and there's nothing to be done.

One: Cook unpounded black rice harder than regular rice, about as firm as takikomi rice, and put it in a cloth bag about the size of a tea bag (but only fill it seven-tenths full). Put this in the miso soup and simmer for about one boil - the salty taste will immediately disappear and it becomes excellent soup. This is a closely guarded secret. However, when guests arrive unexpectedly, make the bags smaller and put five or six of them into the pot containing the miso soup.

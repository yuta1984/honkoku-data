　skin, make as thin as possible, wash once with
　warmed sake, and discard the sake. For vinegar, make
　broth from the bird bones and simmer it, let it cool slightly, then pour over the bird
　and dress it. Do not add wasabi or katsuobushi flakes.
　It's good to mix in a little fish.
One: For winter sushi, it's good to warm it. It's good
　to add a little irizake to warmed vinegar as well.

One: For summer namasu, except for carp and crucian carp, adding even a little irizake is bad.
　It's good to add only sake and water.
　　　　○Bird Skin Dish (with raw skin)
One: Whether wild goose or duck, keeping the fatty skin attached,
　make as thin as possible, and for thick parts of the meat, slice them
　thin. Put dashi, soy sauce, sake, and a little vinegar in a pot, bring this to
　a quick boil, and when well cooked, remove from heat
　and add the bird. The broth should be at a level that just covers the ingredients,
　reduced from the beginning in the pot. After adding the bird,
　do not cook further. Add plenty of wasabi and stir.
　The bird should be made very thin and fine.
　It cooks to a good degree and becomes tender.

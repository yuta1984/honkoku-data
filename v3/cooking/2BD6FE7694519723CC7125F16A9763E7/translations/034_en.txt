【Left Page】
One portion Chinese glutinous rice - whether winter-bleached or regular, wash very well until the water runs clear, and put in a bleached cloth bag.
However, the size depends on preference. Bring water to a good boil, put in the bag and boil in the hot water. To judge the degree of cooking, test in various ways with your finger - when well-cooked it becomes soft. If undercooked it will be hard. When well-cooked, place on a cutting board, gently pound with a pestle, then untie the bag and cut with string in any manner desired. Dōmyōji dried rice may also be used.

○Method for Grilled Rice Cakes

Cut finely and arrange tightly in a flat pan. Add water just enough to cover the dried bonito flakes, then place whole tofu on top. Make sure the tofu does not get submerged in water, make the charcoal fire as strong as possible, and simmer for more than half a day. When the water runs out, add more water so that the tofu doesn't get submerged, and continue cooking. ○Remove the dried bonito and make only the tofu into a salt-seasoned shio-ni (salt simmering). For garnish, use roughly chopped white scallions with either hana-yuzu citron or tree buds. ○Alternatively, thin kuzu starch with grated wasabi is also good.

Add a little kuzu powder as a binder and grind well again. ○Take imported finest quality raw carmine and extract it well with sugar water. Use the finest white sugar, decoct it, strain through silk, and use hot water. Then squeeze out the raw carmine and reduce it by simmering in a double boiler to the right consistency. 《Side note: Reduce it more lightly than when used for ordinary painting materials》 Mix this into the ground tofu to make it pale pink. The proportion is roughly one sheet of raw carmine to two blocks of tofu. Too dark a color is not good. Take the right amount and steam it.

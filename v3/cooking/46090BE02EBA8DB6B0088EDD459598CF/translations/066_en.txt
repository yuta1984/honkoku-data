"Biography of Sokun" by Xu Zhongyue Zhaichong of the Ming Dynasty
　The above is said to be included in the eighth volume of "Guang Xie Shi" (Expanded Humorous History) compiled by Chen Liangqing, but the books I have examined are missing this text. "Guang Xie Shi" is a Ming edition imported book, and naturally there are not many copies in the world. Therefore, I have widely requested from book collectors and examined several copies, but all are missing pages and lack the "Biography of Sokun." In the future, when I obtain a complete copy, I should supplement this text.

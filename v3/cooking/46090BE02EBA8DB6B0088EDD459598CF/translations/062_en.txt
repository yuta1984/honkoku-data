Its softness and non-toxic nature are explained in detail in the treatise by the great physician Dr. Kagawa (published after Yakusen and the first volume of Hyakuchin).
There is also a poem by the elderly master Jinsai:
"With loose teeth and fallen molars, eating everything is difficult; I only realize tofu's superiority among foods.
The vast and profound delicacies of Huainan are numerous, yet none match this flavor so rich and tender."

○In the craftsmen's poetry contest (uta-awase), participants were divided into left and right groups to compete with poems. The themes were "moon" and "love," judged by group discussion. It must have been quite entertaining.
Number 37: Tofu seller
"In my hometown, tofu forms in the river's calm waters
Its whiteness was not dyed by the moon"
"When in love, it becomes painful, Uji tofu
How can I ask the name of such an earnest person"

○Kitamura Shichiri, a person from Niigata in Echigo province, with the pen name Kantei, was a master of haikai poetry. Perhaps because he favored tofu, his kyōka reads:
"The wild geese and ducks abandon me and fly away
How delightful that tofu has no wings"

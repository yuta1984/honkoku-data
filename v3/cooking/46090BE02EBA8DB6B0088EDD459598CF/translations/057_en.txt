Sprinkle finely powdered okara that has been roasted in a roasting pan and ground well with a medicine grinder. Most importantly, serve quickly while it hasn't disappeared.

Thirty-six: Kanro Tofu　　Take the best quality frozen tofu, soak it well in water, and simmer it well with rock sugar. Do not use salt, and serve as soup in small Nara tea bowls. Separately, as accompaniments to sake, arrange spicy dishes or very sour vinegared items as side dishes. This is an excellent concept that will bring smiles to sake drinkers' faces.

Thirty-seven: Buried Kabayaki　　Whether eel kabayaki or other grilled items, stir-fry tofu okara in oil as usual, and while it's warm, bury the freshly grilled food so thoroughly that the flesh is hidden, handle quickly, and tightly cover the vessel. This is a method to prevent cooling even when left for a long time. It's excellent for carrying long distances or giving to others. The seasoning is the same as the concept in Appendix 26 "Asaji Sea Bream" and is most delicious. Burying freshly boiled whole chicken eggs in okara in the same manner is also interesting.

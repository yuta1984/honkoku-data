6. Imamiya Sand Dengaku　　Pile up sand abundantly around the brazier, stick the dengaku skewers
diagonally into the sand, make a strong fire, and cook over more distant heat than
regular dengaku. ○Tea houses at the gate of Imamiya in northern Kyoto use
this method. The grilling is exceptionally good.

7. A Type of Castella　　Squeeze the water well from tofu, mix it thoroughly
with the liquid squeezed from amazake (sweet rice wine), and steam it. The seasoning is according to
taste. ○This is a different method from castella number 91 in the previous volume.

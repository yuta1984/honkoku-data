○The origin of the name "dengaku" (grilled tofu) dates back to the time of Sagami Nyūdō (Hōjō Tokimune), when there was a type of dance-drama called dengaku-hōshi (dengaku priests). Known as shinza and honza dengaku, they were popular and celebrated among the people, as recorded in the Taiheiki. Even today, this music exists in the festivals of Kasuga Shrine in Nara. There is particularly a performance called takashi (high legs), and because grilled tofu skewered on sticks resembles this form, it was named dengaku. In Kaga, Noto, and Etchū provinces, dengaku is prepared by standing it vertically in the hearth and piercing it to grill.
The sand dengaku of Imamiya mentioned in volume six is also the same - this represents the ancient method of making dengaku.

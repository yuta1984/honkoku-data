Sixty-seven: Another method　　Take what has been steamed using the above method, finely chop sake lees, add a little sake and a little soy sauce. Layer alternately—one layer of lees, one layer of tofu, then again one layer of lees, one layer of tofu—continuing this way for many layers. If prepared during the cold season and buried in the ground, it will keep until the following summer.

Sixty-eight: Ogura Dengaku　　Cut one side of fried tofu at an angle, sprinkle boiled azuki beans on top, skewer it, and grill with fresh soy sauce. ○Sprinkle grated yuzu on top. ○Fried tofu grilled with pepper and soy sauce is called "Ranja-masu" (Temple Trout).

Sixty-nine: Chitose Tofu　　Remove the cloth pattern from tofu and cut to a thickness of six to seven bu (about 1.8-2.1 cm). Make cuts like a pine cone pattern without letting the pieces separate, then boil. This especially requires skillful cooking technique. Scoop with a mesh ladle and serve in a bowl, then pour a mixture of green miso with grated udo (Japanese spikenard) over it in a thick consistency. The miso enters the cuts and naturally produces a pine-like aroma.

Season well to make an soft scrambled tofu and serve
in a cooking pot. Serve with grated wasabi.

5. Megawa Dengaku　　Boil kudzu starch soup in a pot, and while skewering the tofu,
continuously simmer it, taking it out to place over a brazier, then taking it out to place over the brazier
again. Unlike regular dengaku, there is no need to grill it - just remove the
moisture, apply miso paste, and serve at the table while keeping it
over a small brazier. This is the original
method from Megawa in Ōmi Province.
○As an alternative method, instead of simmering, continuously steam
in a steamer. This is also good.

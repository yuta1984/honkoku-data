splash it on generously. The ingredients are the same as for kaminari tofu.

Fifty-two: Mizore (Sleet) Soba　　Cook oboro tofu with dashi soy sauce in a slightly thicker consistency than usual. ○Boil soba noodles as usual, serve in a bowl, and splash the above tofu generously over it. The tofu should be slightly more abundant than the soba.
○Chopped white scallions, grated daikon radish, and grated wasabi are prepared as usual.

Fifty-three: A Type of Imadegawa Tofu　　Cut one block into about three pieces, lightly grill, simmer well in dashi broth, hollow out one side with a metal spoon, mix karashi mustard and put it in the hollowed space, fit back together as before, and serve with thin kudzu starch sauce poured over. ○There is Imadegawa tofu in item thirty-nine of the previous volume, with a slightly different preparation method.

Fifty-four: Ingredient-filled Oubaku Tofu　　Prepare like the oubaku tofu seen in item ten (raitei/kaminari tofu) of the previous volume, and add wood ear mushrooms, Chinese yam, split ginkgo nuts, fried konnyaku, thinly cut wheat gluten, walnuts, arrowhead tubers, shaved burdock root - each pre-seasoned - and Japanese pepper powder.

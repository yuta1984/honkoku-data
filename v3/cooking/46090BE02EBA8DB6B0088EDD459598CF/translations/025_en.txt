Forty-two: Board-grilled Tofu　　Take very thin cedar boards cut to appropriate size and spread butterbur miso thickly on them. Add spice appropriately. Cut one block of tofu flat into about four or five pieces of medium thickness, place on the board spread with miso, spread miso on top as well, place another cedar board on top and sandwich, grill over strong distant fire until the boards are charred. Turn over with the board and grill again. Then gently remove the top board and serve on a plate with the bottom board still attached. Don't worry if there are places where the miso didn't stick or stuck sparsely when the top board is removed - use this as a pattern
○Thinly shaved boards may also be used

About preparing jellied dishes (yosemono)
Knead kanten (agar) with water and boil it until it dissolves completely in water.
With this, dissolve any color and apply it to anything,
then set it in a mold, let it sit for a while and remove it. Whatever you put it in
will turn out beautifully. For items colored and applied to anything, dissolve the remaining
kudzu starch with kanten water, and apply this over what was previously applied,
then set it again on top, let it sit for a while and remove. This is the oral transmission.
Also, lay something in a box, dissolve kudzu starch in that water and pour it in, then spread
the colored items previously placed on the tray into the center. In all cases,
skillful craftsmanship is essential.

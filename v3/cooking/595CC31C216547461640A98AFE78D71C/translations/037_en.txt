Fire Control for Grilled Foods　　For usute-yaki, matsukaze-yaki, usugoromo-yaki and various other types,
　　　　　　　　　fire control is essential. For this, place two small openings of the belly
　　　　　　　　　over the fire under the leaves and turn to ash - this is just right.
　　　　　　　　　Also, some items prefer strong fire, and in such cases
　　　　　　　　　remove one of the upper straw ashes.
　　　　　　　　　This way you can achieve control over both weak and strong fires.
　　　　　　　　　While direct fire and other large fires should all be strong,
　　　　　　　　　the upper fire should generally be applied after the inside has colored,
　　　　　　　　　otherwise it will puff up excessively.

Re-boiled Sake　　　　Put sake in a pot and when it comes to a boil, light the fire
　Quickly　　　　　　and insert it into the sake - it will flame up. Quickly blow it out
Method to Remove Alcohol　and use it - the alcohol will be well removed.

About Oil　　　　　　When re-boiling oil, fire can catch and flare up.
　　　　　　　　　If you panic and add water, it will become an even fiercer fire,
　　　　　　　　　which is terribly dangerous. At such times,
　　　　　　　　　don't panic and throw some green vegetables
　　　　　　　　　into the oil - it will extinguish immediately.
　　　　　　　　　　　I include this here for your knowledge.

Culinary Questions and Answers　　This is the secret of secrets. Do not treat carelessly.

○Question: I want to make steamed dishes, but whether I steam strongly with high heat
　or steam gently, the ingredients inside become watery or crack, and don't turn out
　as intended. What should I do?

△Answer: The method for steamed dishes depends on the hardness or softness of the
　ingredients inside, but in any case, place in a steamer and steam twice from below,
　then open and look inside - the ingredients will have perspiration on them. This perspiration
　should be wiped away frequently with a cloth until steaming is complete. If perspiration
　remains on top, cracking will occur. Also, if it puffs up too much, remove the steamer
　temporarily to cool once, then steam again - the ingredients will settle and
　steam well this time.

Dengaku-yaki　This name also does not come from tofu as mentioned above. There were 
　　　　　　　performers called dengaku-tsukai in ancient times who performed
　　　　　　　various arts, including wearing wooden clogs on bamboo poles,
　　　　　　　jumping and walking about for entertainment.
　　　　　　　The name dengaku comes from resembling this form. Therefore,
　　　　　　　not limited to tofu, anything skewered and served
　　　　　　　should properly be called dengaku.
　　　　　　　Think of uba-yaki as wrapped horizontally, dengaku as skewered vertically.

Kinome-yaki　　Lizardfish salted and wrapped in citron leaves, then wrapped
　　　　　　　in wet paper and steamed-grilled, served broken open.

Kōmō-yaki　　　Dutch-style grilled sea bream preparation was described in the previous volume.
　　　　　　　However, while the method is the same for all, for halfbeak, butterflied fish,
　　　　　　　monkfish, and red gurnard, to present them beautifully,
　　　　　　　first make thin omelet sheets, and for any fish,

　　　　　　　butterfly it and lightly salt it, apply egg white
　　　　　　　to the flesh surface, attach the prepared thin omelet,
　　　　　　　grill it on, and cut the egg around the fish shape.
　　　　　　　However, it's best to salt the fish and dry it slightly in the sun.

Tosa-yaki　　　Can be done with any fish. Grilled skewered with
　　　　　　　Japanese pepper miso marinade. Perhaps called this because
　　　　　　　the marinade is applied on top of the fish.

Teppō-yaki　　Same as above, but using chili pepper miso
　　　　　　　marinade.

Vegetarian　　　This refers to bamboo shoots, with skin intact and raw, cutting off the base,
Teppō-yaki　　　removing the inner joints, adding sake, salt, and soy sauce,
　　　　　　　　pouring it in, plugging the cut end with daikon radish,
　　　　　　　　placing in straw ash and grilling. When done, remove and peel the skin before cutting.

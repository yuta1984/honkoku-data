and becomes crescent moon-shaped. When you think you've seen the yolk centered,
it sometimes turns out like that.

△Answer: The yolk being off-center is the natural disposition of the egg, so it cannot
be helped, but if you want to center the yolk in hand-cooking, when boiling,
hold chopsticks and continuously rotate the egg while boiling without rest - then
the yolk will be in the center.
　Also, put a thin board in the pot, carve an egg-sized hole in that board,
submerge the board in the boiling water just enough to cover it, put the egg
in that hole and boil while rotating with chopsticks - this works well.

○Another question: Sometimes boiled eggs are cut with a knife, shell and all, and served.
　How should this be done?

△Drop vinegar into the boiling water and boil - then it can be cut freely with a knife.
However, you should also apply a little vinegar to the knife.

○Question: When making the base for clear soup, using dashi, sake, and salt, and also when
　tasting the finished clear soup with side ingredients, sometimes there is a slight sourness.
　Which of soy sauce, sake, salt, or dashi is excessive, and
　what should be done?
　This is the crucial point. If you add soy sauce it becomes salty, if you add water it becomes bland,
　and moreover, if you keep adding as described, that sourness will be corrected and true flavor
　will emerge.

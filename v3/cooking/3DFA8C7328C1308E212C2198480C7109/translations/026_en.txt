Then place in a container, cover with a damp cloth as a lid, and keep away from wind. Take out one at a time and knead well. For boiling time, taste and judge. For broth, use clear broth or sauce miso, with pepper and plum.

"Keiran" (Egg noodles): Six parts glutinous rice, four parts regular rice, grind into fine powder, sift through silk, sieve many times, when ready knead with water, wrap brown sugar inside, form into kumquat-sized balls and boil. Broth same as udon. However, for rice preparation, soak briefly in water, then quickly remove and place in a tub, press down evenly and set aside. If too quick, the flour will be coarse and heavy; if soaked too long, the flour becomes wet and sticky, making it impossible to sift.

"Kirimugi" (Cut wheat noodles): Salt ratio and kneading method all same as udon. For broth, use clear broth or sauce miso with mustard.

"Kuzu somen" (Arrowroot thin noodles): First dissolve a little arrowroot in water, heat to about the temperature of rice cooking water, transfer to a tub to cool, then knead the flour with this. The right consistency is when you lift and drop it, it forms threads that don't break easily. Too quick to drop or breaking easily are both bad. Make the opening finger-width size. A bowl works well. Thickness depends on the skill of the opening. Bring pot water to a good boil. When the somen changes color from cooking, scoop up with a ladle, put in water to cool, and knead-wash well. Change the water repeatedly to make it increasingly white and beautiful. Broth same as kirimugi. Must use good quality arrowroot. Various oral instructions exist for this.

"Yamanoimo-men" (Yam noodles): Finely grate yam, finely pound six parts glutinous rice flour and four parts regular rice flour, knead with yam when ready, make small balls and roll out like making kirimugi. For boiling, they're done when they float to the surface. Broth also same as kirimugi.

"Suisen" (Narcissus): Dissolve arrowroot flour in water. The right consistency is thick enough that a drop placed on something will hang without falling. Put this in a suisen pot to the right thickness, place over hot water, when it changes color and hardens, put the whole pot into boiling water, when cooked lift out, transfer to cold water to cool, then cut when ready. Broth also same as kirimugi. Putting into boiling water too quickly is bad.

"Suiton" (Dumpling soup):

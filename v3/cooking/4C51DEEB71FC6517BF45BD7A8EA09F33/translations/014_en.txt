　　　　△Remove skin and seeds from simmered plums, strain through the back of a grinding bowl, add a little miso and sugar, grind and mix together △For carrots, peel and cut into pieces about one inch long, slice thinly lengthwise, then cut very finely lengthwise, soak in water, lift out and boil until yellow - this is called "white-hair carrots" △Double narcissus: as in the previous volume, bake thin rice crackers, mix colors of white, red, blue, yellow etc., layer and cut to shape. Simmered plums are a specialty of Chikushi, with twenty varieties here

　　　　Shiitake mushrooms
　　　　Five pieces included

　　Tree buds

　　　　△For Kenchō yuba, boil dried gourd strips well, season and arrange, wrap in flat yuba and make thick rolls.

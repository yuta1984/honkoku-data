○Yamabuki (Japanese Kerria) Instructions

Make carrots as shown in this diagram and cut very thinly. Place on palm and use the head of a pipe to create a curved hollow in the center, then soak in water. Make the base like a chrysanthemum base using arrowhead bulbs. Butterbur sprouts also work well. Layer two of these flower forms, and make the pistils with carrots as with the previous small chrysanthemums, or grate carrots with a wasabi grater and place on top. Make buds with carrots. Use small arrowhead bulbs for the base, or red pepper calyxes will also work.

Use yamabuki branches for branches. If unavailable, use young kalimeris leaves or similar-looking leaves.

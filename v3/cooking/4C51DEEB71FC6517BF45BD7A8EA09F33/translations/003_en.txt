Collection of Meal Arrangements, Volume Two

《Title: Collection of Vegetarian Meal Arrangements, Volume Two》

Previously, I published the "Collection of Vegetarian Meal Arrangements," which detailed everything from how to prepare fashionable combination dishes of the current era to seasoning methods, primarily focusing on what would be convenient and suitable for Buddhist ceremonies and memorial services, collecting and presenting numerous meal arrangements. However, there were still many other interesting combination cooking methods that were omitted from that work. This collection gathers those methods, ranging from simple ones like late-night tea-and-rice meals to formal arrangements including second-course meals with two soups and five dishes, seven dishes, or even nine dishes for elaborate occasions, all presented here in continuation.

Furthermore, extending to the preparation of mizumono (sweet dishes/desserts), decorative cutting techniques, and mincing methods, I have illustrated everything with diagrams, hoping this will serve as a reference for amateur cooking as well.

The core remaining in the center of the upper diagram, as shown on the left. From around here, do not cut the leaves off, but remake as shown.

See the following

Peel the core of the fourth angle above on three sides to make it like this angle. For what becomes like this angle, cut slightly into the three sides at these places, and place the petals made earlier into those spots. Especially attach them blowing upward on three diagonal sides. It becomes as shown on the left.

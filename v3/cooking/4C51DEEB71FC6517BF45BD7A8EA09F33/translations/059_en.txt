Diagram of Finished Peony

For white peonies, large chestnuts are best. For red flowers (safflower), the petals are colored with red pigment.

○Camellia Instructions

Same as peony. Chestnuts or sweet potatoes are good. For white camellias, chestnuts are best.

The peeling method is the same as for peony petals - peel and place on palm, use knife spine to add vertical curves, then lower down. Make five of these petals, and five more slightly smaller ones.

For the pistil, follow peony method but make slightly smaller. Peonies use five carrot wraps. For camellias, two are sufficient.

Wood cutting: Do as shown

Petal attachment follows peony method
Buds: Use half of small arrowhead tuber, remove skin, then at the halfway point, make cuts as shown in diagram

For branches, use camellia wood, or if unavailable, use bird lime or twisted materials

○The cooking method is the same as for black skin.

Kiridashi (Cut-outs) - These are scraps. Cut out the white, soft parts with skin from inside the skin meat, or cut out the oil-free parts from the red meat, or cut out the oil-free parts from the tongue. Gathering all these small cuts together is called kiridashi. In rural areas, this is used as food for servants. It is very low-grade.
○Use by pouring soy sauce over it, or cooking it in stews.

Akami (Red Meat) - This is the meat inside the skin. The color is reddish-black. When fresh, the red meat from semi whales is the best.
○Cut thinly, pour lukewarm water over it, use in simmered dishes. With wheat gluten, matsutake mushrooms, mitsuba (Japanese parsley), in clear soup. With fresh nori seaweed, or young wakame seaweed, bōfū (coastal glehnia).
○Marinate in miso for about two days, then grill and cut thinly for use.
○Cut thinly, with sake vinegar-miso or soy sauce, good for sukiyaki.
○Cut thickly, salt-grill it, then cut thinly again for use.
○Cut thinly and blanch in hot water, good with fresh soy sauce or sanbaizu (three-flavor vinegar).

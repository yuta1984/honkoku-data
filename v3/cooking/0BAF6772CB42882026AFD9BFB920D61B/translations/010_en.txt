This is called sunoko. The thick parts are about one shaku, and the thin parts are three to four sun. When fresh, the taste is heavy. Salted versions have a lighter taste and are better. Semi whales have neither une nor sunoko.

○Fresh meat is cut thinly and used for nabeyaki (pot-grilled dishes).
○Salted meat is cut thinly, soaked in water to remove salt. Pour hot water over it, wash well with water, and eat with sanbaizu (three-flavor vinegar) or with vinegar miso.
○Prepared as above, combine with vegetables for clear soup, which is good.

Kawami (Skin Meat) - Both black skin and white skin. All collected skins are called kawami. Fish with strong oil content are difficult to use as food, so they fry them in oil to eat the parts with less oil. The black skin mentioned earlier refers to back skin, side skin, and other parts with little oil, so they were used exclusively as food. What is called katakawa (single skin) is also the skin from both sides of round cuts, with little oil and good for food.

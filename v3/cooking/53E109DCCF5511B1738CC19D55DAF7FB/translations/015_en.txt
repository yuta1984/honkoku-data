Items to prepare in May - recorded on the left:

Ginger storage method: Dig deep into the soil in front of the stove, lay rice hulls at the bottom, place ginger on top and cover with soil. This preserves large quantities for a long time.

Fresh bamboo shoot storage method: Put fresh bamboo shoots in a barrel with a lid and bury in a fast-flowing part of a river. First place stones as weights. They stay fresh and delicious indefinitely. The storage method for eggplant is the same.

Ginger salt pickling method: Chop ginger to a good size, remove moisture well and pickle in plum vinegar. Wrap a little mustard in silk and place at the bottom. Done this way, it keeps well for a year.

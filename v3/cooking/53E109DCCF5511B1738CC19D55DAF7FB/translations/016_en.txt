Fish and Egg Salt Method (prevents mold)

During extreme heat, fillet fish into three pieces and place in a large bowl with one cup of water. Then add salt. After that, add an egg to test.

If the egg sinks, add more salt. When the balance is right, the egg will float.

With this balance, fish will keep well.

Plum Wine Recipe: 1 sho of aged sake, 20 large plums, sugar as needed
Select plums without any blemishes, remove the flower sepals, rub with rice grains, soak in lye water overnight, wash, wipe dry, and add to sake.

Method to prevent rice from souring
Cover rice with amaranth leaves and it won't sour even after one night.

Method to preserve fresh fish
Knead udon flour and wrap fish in it, then store in oil - it won't spoil. Another method: soak in snow water from the cold season and it will keep for a long time without spoiling.

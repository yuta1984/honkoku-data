Beautiful presentation pleases the eye when eating, good aroma is eaten with the nose, and taste is eaten with the tongue. If any of these is lacking, it would be poor.

One person said: Tokyo cuisine follows generally meticulous customs, favoring particularly clean presentation within bowls and seeking somewhat unusual creative touches. The seasoning is light with a little salt, generally not using sake, disliking white miso and primarily using red miso. This is most interesting. Osaka, being a merchant land, has hearty portions in its cuisine. Above all, they dislike anything crude in every matter. Kyoto, being distant from the seashore, sometimes lacks fish and fowl, habitually uses preserved foods well, and has many skilled practitioners of nimble food pairing and preparation methods, generally putting proper arrangement first. Regional cuisines vary greatly and there is no time to record them all.

However, in today's enlightened and progressive age, not only the three major cities but other regions as well can freely create menus and cuisine thanks to the convenience of trains, steamships, and transportation networks.

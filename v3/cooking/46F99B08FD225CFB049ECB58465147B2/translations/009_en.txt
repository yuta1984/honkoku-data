　　　　About kaiseki
There is something called the "Ten Attitudes of Preparation" (according to writings by Yamanoue Hyōan). First, regarding kaiseki:
　Various things should be changed each time, but among these, the orthodox style may be repeated many times
　Novel presentations should occur only once or twice in ten times, and for young people who possess famous items, three or four
　times may be permitted. The specialty is to include items that appear humble
　Generally, to make artifice in tea ceremony means: first, the banquet, or calling dawn guests (or abundant guests?),
　or going uninvited; second, the manner of displaying utensils; and then novel service or
　sometimes employing women. However, one should not imitate others' methods
　One should create one's own new practices. When entertaining nobles, everything should be done in a novel manner
　At the time of Shōō, until about ten years ago (this is noted as Tenshō 18, Year of the Metal Tiger), gold and silver were
　scattered about and even second and third trays were served
　　　(I say that from reading this book, it is clear that Rikyū also favored this and
　　　established the methods that continue to this day. Indeed, having too many elements in kaiseki would be inappropriate)
Someone said that ancient tea masters praised first the sincerity of intention, next praised the excellence of the tea,
　next praised the tea room and the work of charcoal and flowers, next praised how the utensils
　suited the tea, and next praised the success of the hospitality

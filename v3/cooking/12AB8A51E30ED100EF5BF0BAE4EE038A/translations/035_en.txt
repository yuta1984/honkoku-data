Make fine cuts and simmer in sake, then cool. Then make a savory stew with mirin, sake, and soy sauce.

○The same with honey: Take small salted eggplants, remove salt well, and simmer only with sugar. If not well boiled at first, the eggplant's harsh taste will emerge and become bitter.

○Crushed ginkgo nuts: Roast ginkgo nuts, remove the inner skin well, dip in boiling water and lift out, then crush with a hammer. Then make into savory stew.

○Rolled daikon: Take good daikon without fibers, remove skin, cut into pieces about one inch long, peel thinly and round, roll into spirals, seal the joints with kudzu paste, and make into savory stew.

○Kyara-buki (seasoned butterbur): This is prepared in advance, not made fresh. Split butterbur lengthwise into thin strips, boil sake and soy sauce with red pepper to make a base, immediately simmer the butterbur in this base until concentrated, put in a jar-like container, close the lid, and leave for just a short while.

○Ginger tofu: Add ginger to regular prepared tofu.

○Grilled sweetfish tofu: Like dengaku, brush with soy sauce and grill. Serve with tade vinegar.

○Nikogori (jellied broth): This is a summer dish. When it doesn't set, show it when slightly set. Often kanten is added to the cooking broth, but this makes the taste poor. For this, add a little mizuame (rice syrup) and bracken powder to the cooking broth, then it will set [when cooled].

The above methods are roughly those marked in various menus, and their full methods appear throughout this volume.

However, the concentrated cooking methods, miso and clear oil broth - these two types are necessarily used in the same way as fucha cuisine, so they are included in the appendix of the Sanji Collection and omitted here for now.

Furthermore, the Sanji publication is forthcoming, so it should be consulted.

On the concept of cooking while aboard ship

Ship cuisine does not particularly differ from regular kaiseki dining. It's simply that space is cramped and one wishes to avoid the stuffiness of cooking and boiling, so everything should be well-prepared before bringing the catered food aboard the boat. Accordingly, it is essential to plan the menu simply. Also, when mooring boats on inner rivers for leisure, there are often unpleasant odors from the riverbanks. Even without that, in cramped spaces there are human vapors and the smell of sweat, so for soup appetizers and garnishes for side dishes, one should use fragrant and refreshing items. Use mostly clear salt-based broths, and for miso soup, boil and strain the miso without grinding it. The flavor should be light. Avoid rich, heavy dishes of any kind. However, oily large fish and deep-fried tofu help ward off heat, so having two or three such dishes is acceptable. The Dutch tempura and dishes made with potato starch and sweet soup base mentioned in the upper tier of the previous box are concepts for dispelling summer heat. From this, one can understand the rest. Also, one should devise clever, inspired dishes to capture people's interest.

I will record one or two examples of such creativity below. Following these examples, one should make impromptu innovations as circumstances require. However, these are not limited only to boats - there should be various innovations for regular drinking parties as well. But these things are not absolutely necessary, and if they might break etiquette depending on the guests and occasion, one should act appropriately according to the circumstances.

○Cut a watermelon in half, scoop out the flesh well, and use the rind as a bowl to serve the watermelon - this is amusing.

○Fill a large bowl with water, cut abalone decoratively to make "water shellfish," and catch small fish called "gichi" that play near the riverbank and release them into the water - this is good.
　Note that these "gichi" are young needlefish that live abundantly in riverside waters and are easy to catch. When put into the water with the shellfish, they float and swim about, creating a very pleasant scene.

There should be even more ingenious ideas along these lines.

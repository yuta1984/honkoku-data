　　　General Rules
1. The various dishes for layered food boxes (jūzume) are divided into upper, middle, and lower sections, one portion each. However, when the heading shows "nine varieties" but there are actually eight items, underneath it will indicate what is for spring, what is for summer, what is for autumn, and what is for winter. The items are combined one by one. This is to distinguish the four seasons, and the same applies to seven varieties and five varieties.

1. The first layer contains fish dishes, the second layer vegetarian dishes, the third layer raw ingredients, and the fourth layer steamed items and sweets. There are also cases where fish and vegetarian dishes are combined in the first layer, making the third layer sashimi and similar dishes. This is for food boxes sent to other houses and boxes for the Doll Festival, etc., where fish and vegetarian dishes are separated for the convenience of the recipient. For food boxes for cherry blossom viewing and excursions, since it's for one's own convenience, they are combined without separation.

1. Raw ingredients are only included when the destination has facilities for cooking and grilling. Therefore, boxes for countryside travel or welcoming ceremonies do not include these. However, raw ingredients are not included in boxes for visiting after childbirth, as this is during a busy time when the household is dealing with illness.

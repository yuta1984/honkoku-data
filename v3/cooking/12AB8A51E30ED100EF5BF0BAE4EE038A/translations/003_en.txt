1. Day-waiting ceremonies and evening meal trays all use surname rice (formal rice service) with the menu listed. Also, since day-waiting ceremonies sometimes involve vegetarian cuisine, flat dishes and tea bowl servings are prepared separately as vegetarian dishes. However, sake cups, individual salt dishes, etc., are all arranged as vegetarian from the beginning, so they are not listed separately.

1. For various molded dishes, the preparation methods are recorded, and their shapes are shown in colored diagrams. The same applies to vegetarian dishes.

　For everything else, a table of contents is provided on the left, indicating the main points of several articles.
　The dishes omitted from this volume will be included in the third volume, and although there is no time at present, I wish to publish it and spread it widely throughout the world.

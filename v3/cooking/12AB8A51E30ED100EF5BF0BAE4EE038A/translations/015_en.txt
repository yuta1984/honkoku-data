Same, middle class - However, for ordinary illness visits, the first tier should be (made into) noodle dishes and such. Generally, one tier should be considered appropriate.

             Eight-name sweet jelly
             Ogura (sweet bean paste)
             Gyuhi rice cake
             Candy

                       Small flounder, Lily bulb

             Kudzu dumplings in soup
             Slurping dumplings
             Kudzu steamed buns
             Egg noodles

           Colored and grilled, cut both as boards and lotus root style

Fourth tier: Azuki bean rice, bleached

Both birth celebration visits and illness visits involve nursing or household members, but the patient's food should be prepared separately. However, since it should not be harmful, it should be prepared with delicious things. Since it is a busy time, raw preparations and such are not used.

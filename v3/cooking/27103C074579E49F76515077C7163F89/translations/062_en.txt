Season with soy sauce and keep warm, put into the aforementioned pot, dissolve mustard and pour over before serving.

Tsuto-dofu (Bundle Tofu)
Add kudzu to tofu to make it firm, wrap in cloth, then wrap in a straw bundle (tsuto) and steam. Remove the bundle, simmer in raw soy sauce, and cut into small rounds.

Soba-kiri (Cut Buckwheat Noodles)
Flour from Shinano should be kneaded with hot water. Flour made in warm places should be kneaded with cold water. Medium-grade flour is good. Old flour is bad. For this soba, it is good to add three eggs or one block of tofu per sho of flour. When preparing soba for many people for dinner, one must start making it from morning. Since it deteriorates in flavor, boil the noodles in water, cool that water well, ensure the noodles do not clump together, then knead and roll with that water.

Jōshin-zuke (Constant Heart Pickle)

Wash daikon radish well and dry thoroughly until there is no moisture.
Sift rice bran and pickle with two gō of salt per one shō of bran. {{Side note: Moisture is｜not good｜}}
For the pickling method, daikon that is too thick is not good. Ordinary 
daikon that is slightly thin is best. Place weights moderately,
this balance is good. Pickle during daikon season and use 
deliciously stored around February-March. When opening the container,
remove the liquid on top and take out the pickles, then
place weights as before and put that salt liquid back in.
Use from around February-March to around June,
this is good. Making it as daikon mizuke (water pickle) is also fine.


Igami Aemono (Igami Dressed Salad)

Remove the scales and entrails of igami fish, slice the flesh thinly, prepare sesame vinegar by
boiling it down and season with salt, add the prepared fish,
and sprinkle with dried bonito flakes. Warm is good. When cold it is bad.
The fish called igami is found in the bays of Ise, and in other provinces

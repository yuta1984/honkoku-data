Miso Shellfish

Mix miso hard with sake, boil abalone and scrape off
the shellfish miso, chop finely and use in simmered dishes. Male shellfish also work the same way.

Yuzu Purse

Remove the flesh of yuzu citrus, boil the peel, mix adzuki bean flour 
with a little kudzu starch and a little sugar, tie with dried gourd strips 
like a purse by threading the cord through and tying, steam in a steamer 
using sake lees, and use in clear soups. Deep-frying 
would also be good.

Chikuma Tofu

Prepare eggs fluffy in a small pot, portion out 
enough for the number of people, pull the pot aside and re-serve. Prepare in a small pot 
as usual and serve. It is named this way because it resembles 
looking at the dregs in a pot.

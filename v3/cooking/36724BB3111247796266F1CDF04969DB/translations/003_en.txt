In the eternal heavenly feast, things began
With the way of clapping hands, by the ancient water fence
In those long-ago times, when the meat-preparing people (shishibitobe) made sashimi
And offered it before the august presence—
How this was done, we cannot know, but thinking of those
Ancient solemn tales of the horse-keepers of Otsu,
Even in those ancient times
It was not such a grand affair.
Now this scroll is not written to set forth such ancient

Matters, but rather the craft of preparing feasts
That has been passed down from the age of the gods—
Mixing sweet and bitter vegetables in our present time,
Broad-finned fish and narrow-finned fish, fowl of all kinds
Arranged like mountains across the table,
The manner of the heavenly fish-eating—
This I have recorded in detail like white camellias,
Thoroughly and earnestly like sedge roots,
So please turn your heart to this way.

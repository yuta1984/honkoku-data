According to tradition, soups in general have been vegetarian dishes since ancient times. For formal dining and such occasions, vegetarian soups are especially preferred. If using fish-based soups, the accompanying dishes should be vegetarian, or the accompanying dishes should consist only of pickled vegetables to maintain unity. Therefore, the soup section is brief.

According to tradition, hail tofu is cut into dice and deep-fried in oil. Julienned yuzu for sashimi is well-boiled in soy sauce, the inner skin removed, and cut into strips. Yuzu miso is made by grinding sesame, walnuts, and yuzu pulp well, adding a little sugar, placing in a yuzu shell and steaming. Needle chestnuts are used as is. Kanten is cut and set aside, added fresh when serving. "Deep-fried daikon" doesn't mean frying in oil, but simmering together with deep-fried tofu then removing it, preparing the simmered dish separately and adding the daikon when serving.

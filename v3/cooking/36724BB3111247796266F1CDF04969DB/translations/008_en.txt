According to tradition, green vinegar is used from the second month of spring through the seventh month, and one should use quite good vinegar. For the green element, whether it be rapeseed blossoms or mustard greens, one should use whatever green vegetables are in season. Among these, using water pepper is fundamental for summer green vinegar. Generally, using only greens and vinegar results in thin vinegar that is poor. If you grind rice to make a paste and make it slightly thick, it combines well with the greens.
○For finely-cut crucian carp, in all ordinary cooking, items that are flat-cut are better when finely-cut.

Where many are added, do so sparingly. Adding just a little is the way of tea ceremony, and also of rustic simplicity. ○For nuta dressing, adding mustard miso is of course essential. Grind the miso well before using, strain the mustard too, then add vinegar. ○Regarding oyster sea bream, this is a cooking custom. ○Flounder is prepared nage-style. ○For torn sweetfish, around the third month the sweetfish are still small, so they are torn and the bones removed before use. ○For squid green dressing, the squid is lightly boiled.

When pepper buds are not in season, use dried pepper with other greens. ○Abalone is tender when simply cut. However, sea urchin is salty and some people dislike it. Remove the salt overnight and dress with sake. Adding a little refined sake lees is also good. ○For whitebait mustard dressing, quickly parboil before use.
Amber eggs: place one egg yolk each in small sake cups, sprinkle ground roasted salt on top, and after about two days they solidify and become amber-like. Good as accompaniment for sake. ○For grilled fish, mullet and such are good. Salt lightly, grill, shred, and soak in sake. ○Roe sacs are difficult to eat. Cut finely and mix before serving. ○For simmered kamaboko, there should be ingenuity in the cutting method. Generally diagonal cutting is good. ○For simmered abalone, cut to appropriate size, roll in buckwheat flour, let sit for about an hour, then wash well before use. It becomes tender. ○For flounder ara-ni, mainly use the skin, fins, and other garnishing parts. The cutting style should be diagonal cutting—

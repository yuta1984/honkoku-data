According to tradition, suiki should be finely torn, salted, boiled in salt water and drained, then doused with vinegar while hot. This makes it tender with good texture. Deep-fried round wheat gluten is made by deep-frying flat wheat gluten for a long time until it puffs up and becomes round, forming meat-like round gluten. Pounded burdock should be finely chopped and cut so it holds together. Large wrapped yuba uses large yuba filled with pounded burdock, wood ear mushrooms, and hemp seeds, then deep-fried. Wrapped tofu is cut into squares, the center scooped out with a spoon, filled with a mixture of ground sesame, walnuts, and a little miso, covered again with tofu, wrapped round in paper and boiled, then served hot after draining. White kuzu sauce is regular kuzu sauce without soy sauce, mixed with roasted salt and shochu.

▲Regarding inner and outer cuts
The carp climbs the Dragon Gate to achieve rank. If any fish lacks a discerning soul, it has no aspiration to achieve rank. It may simply remain as it is. However, the inner flesh is the thin flesh on the left, and the pulled flesh is the thin flesh on the right. One should take the fin from the floating left plate to process the inner flesh. The thick flesh extends from below the first fin to the "sugi-sashi" fin. "Sugi-sashi fin" is a chef's term, also called the "komamori fin" (child-protecting fin). Below the komamori fin is separate, called "stone pavement." While there are other ways to handle the inner flesh, one should simply write "inner-outer." This is a secret teaching. Regarding layered skin, there should be explanations of its celebratory significance and oral traditions. For inner-turned, pulled-turned, flat-facing, and triangular skin, each

has its oral tradition. There should also be oral traditions regarding double-layer skin.
▲Regarding belly simmering
The carp's achievement of rank comes from the heart. The heart resides in the belly's intestines. Therefore, this is named "intestine simmering" and made into a celebratory dish.
▲Regarding hand-touching
This is the celebration of chopsticks. It is also called "chopstick straightening."

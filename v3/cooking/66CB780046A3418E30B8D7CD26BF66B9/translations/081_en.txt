　from the belly shape at the edge, also cutting away the bulge of small bones
　so they become straight, placing the head side to the right, and generally
　keeping the fins attached, making cross-cuts to a thickness of four or five bu.
　This is used for sea bream, sea bass, etc. ●Flat back-cut means doing as above,
　placing the tail to the right with belly facing away or forward,
　laying the knife flat from the tail side and making cross-cuts about four or five bu thick.
　●Single back-cut means doing as above, filleting one side whether right or left
　like flat back-cut, keeping bone on one side and cutting away from the tail side
　●Straight cut means filleting into three pieces, removing thin flesh, laying the knife
　quite flat from the left side and cutting in a scooping manner ●Scattered cut means filleting,

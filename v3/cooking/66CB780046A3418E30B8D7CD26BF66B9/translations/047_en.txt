How to make chicken rice
Pluck the chicken well, beat the feathers, singe off remaining feathers, then boil the whole chicken. When the chicken oil floats well on the water, remove the chicken and cook rice with that boiling water. Remove the chicken skin once - it comes off well. Shred the remaining meat very finely. When the food starts boiling, hollow out the center of the rice, put in the shredded chicken, press down on top with food, cover the pot and steam thoroughly. When the rice turns yellow, serve in bowls with the steamed chicken placed on top.

Pluck the chicken, singe the feathers and beat them. Remove the organs from the belly, wash everything well, and put inside:
- Glutinous rice flour (one cup), regular rice flour (one cup)
- Sake (one cup), vinegar (one cup)
- Soy sauce (one cup), miso (one cup)
Add daikon radish and bonito, with water enough for cooking rice. Put in the chicken, add water - when you press with your hand flat, the water should come up to your wrist level. Cook like food until all water is gone, let it concentrate by boiling, then use afterwards. This works with duck, geese, or any bird.

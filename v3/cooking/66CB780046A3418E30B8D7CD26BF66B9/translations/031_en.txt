▲Small duck
This is a migratory bird in transit. When used for soup, serves three people. When made into roasted bird, serves two people; when well-fattened, serves three to four people. As substitute for one mallard, use four small ducks as equivalent. Small duck portions are slightly more abundant.
Small duck portions have live birds available from February, and occasionally there are domesticated birds during migration season. Domesticated birds have good fat content even when used in autumn.
The fat is quite white, and among birds this is a superior variety, so it is primarily used for celebratory cuisine.
Also called "taube."

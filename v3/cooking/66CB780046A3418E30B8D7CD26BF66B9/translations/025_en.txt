▲True wild goose: spotted belly, white belly
Wild geese migrate from mid-August and remain in the fields until mid-February. For cooking, when using divided birds, where one wild goose is used, it equals two mallard ducks. When dividing for the number of people in cooking, there should be large and small birds. First, when using for soup, for seventeen or eighteen people, use both breast meat and both thighs.

Make cuts like bone-cutting down to the skin,
then beat 3 or 4 beaten eggs
directly into the cuts.
Then steam in a bowl and serve. Alternatively, cut into
appropriate sizes and steam in
tea bowls before serving, which is also good. In either case,
use kudzu sauce or miso according to
preference. Soy sauce varieties are also fine.
Wasabi, ginger, water pepper, butterbur,
black pepper, Japanese pepper, yuzu, tree buds -
use any combination of the above as appropriate.

○Mock turtle (suppon-modoki)
Red sea bream, sea bream scraps, squid legs,
shark, flathead - any of these will do.
Quickly season with soy sauce and
deep-fry well in sesame oil, then dilute
with bonito stock seasoned with soy sauce.

Green onions, shaved burdock root, myoga
shoots, myoga mushrooms - serve with
these types of ingredients.
Hidden ginger is particularly good.

○Special vinegared octopus
Boil octopus as usual,
cut very finely in upright style,
and thoroughly remove moisture {marginal note: remove moisture with cloth}
Mix good vinegar with soy sauce, change
4 or 5 times while soaking, and
knead well by hand many times. Then
squeeze well and place directly in a bowl
with julienned ginger on top
to serve. No need to reserve the vinegar.
○Cut chili peppers roughly and soak
　in vinegar, then strain as for clear soup.
　Soak the squeezed octopus in this vinegar,
　squeeze well, and serve
　as is - this is also good.

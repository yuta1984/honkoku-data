Mix that vinegar with miso.
For the miso, use yaki-miso (grilled miso), lightly
char it and grind well, then add the above vinegar
to make it thick and rich.
　　Fried tofu 《Take a little dashi and cut finely》
　　Wood ear mushrooms
　　Shredded daikon radish
　　Finely chopped green onions
　　Shiitake mushrooms
　　Chili pepper
Put these ingredients together and mix
to serve. It goes extremely well with
sake and makes an excellent appetizer.

　　○Same fish - Maki-yaki (Roll grilling)

For this preparation, fillet thin fish into three pieces,
roll like maki-zushi with
the skin side inward, wrap around skewers
and grill. Whether grilled with soy sauce,
or salt-grilled, either method is
fine. Cut to appropriate size for use as
tori-zakana (appetizers) or
kumi-zakana (assorted dishes).

　　○Same fish - Dengaku (Miso-glazed grilling)
For this, regardless of fish size,
fillet into three pieces,
wrap around skewers as before,
and secure the roll with bamboo skewers
to hold it in place. First, grill well with
shira-yaki (plain grilling without seasoning):
　　Sansho pepper miso
　　Chili pepper miso
Any of these types of miso,
after grilling well, cut to appropriate size
for hachi-zakana (bowl dishes) or kumi-zakana (assorted dishes)

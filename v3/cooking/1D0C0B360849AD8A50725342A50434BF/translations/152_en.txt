　　Black pepper
　　Red pepper
　　Wasabi
Serve with these types of condiments. Also,
it is good to add freshly squeezed
ginger juice directly

　　○Sushi

This is also prepared as before by cutting into pieces,
first grilling with soy sauce,
adjusting the rice as usual
and marinating for sushi.
The taste is most excellent,
even better than eel sushi

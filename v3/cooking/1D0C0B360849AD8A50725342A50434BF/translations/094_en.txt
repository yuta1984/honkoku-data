○Same, Molded Oysters
Knead and wash oysters well
as before, quickly boil them,
drain in a bamboo strainer or similar,
remove moisture and cool well. Then
beat eggs and add a little
soy sauce, mix well
with the oysters and place in a bowl.
Alternatively, place in a temporary cedar box,
steam, cut into rounds, and serve
as soup with kudzu-thickened broth
or thin kudzu sauce 《with wasabi or pepper》

○Same, Mixed with Pickled Plum
The method is to quickly boil them,
remove moisture well as usual,
using either cooked plum flesh or regular pickled plum
flesh—either is fine.
Add a little white miso and a little sugar,
grind well. Wood ear mushrooms,
rock mushrooms, split chestnuts, lily bulbs—
choose one of these ingredients
to mix and serve.

○Same, Mixed with Herbs
This too is boiled as before,
moisture removed, then mixed
with scallion miso or
water dropwort miso, etc.

○Same, Deep-fried
Quickly boil, wipe away
moisture with a cloth, then
deep-fry in sesame oil 《with grated daikon and soy sauce》
This is very good. Also, removing moisture as above

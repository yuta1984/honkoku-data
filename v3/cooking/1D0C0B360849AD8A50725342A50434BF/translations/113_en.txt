○Country-style Sushi (Inaka-zushi)
As described previously, with any kind of fish, split it from the back and remove the bones, apply salt appropriately and set aside. Then soak the fish in good sake for about one hour, remove it, and use a mixture of that sake with soy sauce (3 parts) and vinegar (7 parts) to moisten the rice thoroughly. Stuff this into the fish, place it in a wooden container from top and bottom, pour in enough of the vinegar mixture to accumulate, and cover with a lid. Then turn the container upside down, place a weight on the bottom, and leave it overnight until the moisture drips down and is completely drained.

Serve with pickled Japanese pepper buds (sansho-tade) or pickled ginger.

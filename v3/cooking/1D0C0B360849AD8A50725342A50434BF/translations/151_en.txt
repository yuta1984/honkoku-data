For this preparation, items that are too large
are not good.
Use medium-sized ones, cut from the edge
into pieces about 6-7 bu each,
remove the entrails well and wash,
remove moisture with
a cloth, then put a little sesame
oil in the pot and heat well.
When it comes to a boil,
cut only the white root parts of scallions
to the same length and put them
in the pot together with the above fish,
stir briefly, judge when it looks
about right, add miso and thin
slightly with sake, then
simmer briefly and serve
in a serving dish.

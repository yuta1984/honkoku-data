Quickly season with soy sauce, thoroughly remove the moisture, and deep-fry in sesame oil. Mix with nebuka (green onion) miso or red pepper miso. Any miso will work well for mixing. However, this should be limited to only the leg portions. If using red pepper miso, place finely chopped green onions on top.

Sansho pepper miso, tree bud miso, pickled plum flesh, or butterbur miso - any of these misos will work well. If using nebuka miso, it would be even better.

○ Soft-shell turtle tempura (same preparation)
As before, deep-fry only the legs in oil, and serve with split green onions, julienned burdock root, and squeezed ginger juice.

○ Salted squid (same preparation)  
Wash thoroughly with water as usual, cut away the edges and slice lengthwise in half, then slice very thinly from the narrow end. Place plenty of layered salt on top, and after a while, rinse with water. Add a little soy sauce to sake and serve with dried bonito flakes.

○ Sashimi (same preparation)
As before, trim the four sides and fillet into about three pieces, slice thinly with good technique, wash well with water again, thoroughly pat dry and transfer to a bowl. For garnishes: tree buds, udo (spikenard), and shiso (perilla).

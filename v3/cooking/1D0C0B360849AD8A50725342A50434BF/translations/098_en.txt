○Same, Small Shrimp Hishiko
This preparation is the same as
sardine hishiko. Pickle only small shrimp
and top generously with bonito flakes,
serve with sake and salt.

○Abalone Mixed with Milt
Regardless of male or female, use vigorous
shellfish, remove the intestines completely around,
slice thinly into fine cuts,
and lightly season with thin soy sauce.
Then, take sea bream milt and
similarly simmer well with soy sauce, sake, and salt,
place in a small mortar
and grind. Adding a little white miso
is also good. Alternatively, grinding
pepper or Japanese pepper first, then
adding the milt is also good. For garnish use
wood ear mushrooms, rock mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms—
any of these cut into thin strips
should be used.

○Also, unraveling the roe and
mixing with abalone blanched
as before is also good.

　　○Chawan-mushi (Savory egg custard)

Regardless of the size of the fish, split as before
and remove the backbone,
first grill without seasoning,
then brush once with soy sauce and grill well again,
cut to proper size.
　　Scallions cut into 5-bu pieces
　　Wood ear mushrooms
　　Ginkgo nuts (chestnuts are
　　　　　　　　also good)
With these three items, beat eggs as usual,
season with dashi and soy sauce,
and make chawan-mushi.
Too many other ingredients
are not good. Sea eel should be
the main ingredient. This is exceptionally
more refined than eel chawan-mushi
and extremely delicious. It is most
suitable for drinking occasions.

　　○An-kake (Thick sauce)

This too, split as before and
remove the backbone, grill without seasoning,
and cut to proper size.

　　Matsutake mushrooms
　　Shimeji mushrooms
　　Duck melon
　　Daikon radish (peeled round)
　　Turnip
Garnish with one item from these,
place in tea bowls and steam,
or place in bowls or lidded dishes
and steam, then pour kuzu
starch sauce over the top and serve.

　　Black pepper

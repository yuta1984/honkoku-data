Place over charcoal fire, coat the inside well with sesame oil, and when the oil has soaked in, arrange the duck and flip once, then serve immediately with raw soy sauce. Alternatively, it's also good to dip in spicy miso thinned with sake before eating. In any case, what's grilled in earthenware has exceptionally good flavor and is quite special.

○Same - Okara Steaming
Cut duck prepared in the usual way into small cubes, then put a little sesame oil in a pot, and when it's well heated, add okara and stir-fry until it becomes dark, then add water dropwort, sansho pepper, etc. along with the duck, mix well together, remove from heat and let sit for a while. Afterwards, transfer to a bowl and serve.

Besides the above, there are various methods for water dropwort grilling, sukiyaki, clear miso soup, marinated grilling, dengaku, miso pickling, etc., but since these are all common preparations, I won't record them.

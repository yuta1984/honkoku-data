○Same, Floating Clouds
This too uses very soft
sea cucumber, washed well, placed
in the bottom of a tub or
mortar, and pounded with a pestle.
Importantly, it should remain
connected in pieces without separating.
Then take an appropriate amount
of this sea cucumber and combine it with egg whites
and grated mountain yam,
add the sea cucumber as well,
beat well together, season with bonito dashi
and soy sauce, and when well cooked,
add these ingredients. When it puffs up,
serve in soup bowls.
Clear broth, thin kuzu starch,
　ground pepper, ground sansho pepper, ginger—
any of these will do. This is an extremely
delicious dish.

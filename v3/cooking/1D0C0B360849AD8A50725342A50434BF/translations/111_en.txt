When transferring, mix well together and 
sprinkle with salt.
○Salt measurement
Salt should be 8 momme and
5 bu per 1 sho of rice. However, even though we say salt,
moist salt and dry salt require
different amounts.
Use the above proportion for salt without moisture.
○Ingredients used for seasoning
　Sea bream (dried ones are also｜acceptable)　Ark shell　Abalone
　Eggs (thin｜omelet)　Wood ear mushroom　Small shiso leaves
　Pine greens
Other ingredients like shiitake mushrooms
are also good. Depending on the season, follow
your preference.

○Nori sushi
For rolled sushi, too many seasonings
[One line in the gutter area not visible]

○Round sushi
　Gobies　Whiting　Small sea bream
　Crucian carp　Young yellowtail　Swamp fish
　Round herring　Small horse mackerel　Young sea bass
　Bitterling　Needlefish　Gizzard shad
　Tuna　Sweetfish　Crucian carp
Any of the above types are good. The method is
to wash as usual, split from the back,
remove both the backbone and belly bones,
apply salt and after a while soak in
good vinegar. Then take out and
wipe off moisture with a cloth
or similar, stuff rice from head
to tail tip, arrange in a tub and
apply weight. Also, if you don't care about appearance
and prioritize flavor, place rice
above and below the fish and
press. The flavor will be exceptional and
most excellent.

It is also good to make it as miso-kake 
using tea bowls and such

　　○Shiki-miso (Layered miso)

This too is prepared as before, garnished with iwatake
and wood ear mushrooms, then steamed
in tea bowls with layered miso or
layered ankake sauce - either is fine
The miso can be any type of miso
as desired

　　○Suimono (Clear soup)

This too, like before, regardless of fish size,
fillet into three pieces,
scrape away the belly bones, cut both fillets
in half, then cut lengthwise into about three pieces
or tie into knots

　　Clear broth
　　Light kuzu starch
　　Oki-miso (placed miso)
　　Salt preparation

Use these to make clear soup
Especially for salt preparation, sprinkle a little
salt on the fish flesh before preparing
Garnishes should be chosen according
to the occasion, and for suikuchi (soup aromatics):

　　Pepper
　　Tree buds (kinome)
　　Ginger
　　Wasabi
　　Japanese pepper (sansho)
　　Yuzu citrus

Choose from these and place on top
before serving

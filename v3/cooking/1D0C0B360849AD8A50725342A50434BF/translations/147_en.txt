The preparation is the same as before: on the
cut fish flesh sprinkle just a little
salt and set aside, then first put
a little salt in the pot and toast it,
then add water and cook
Then wash the salted fish flesh well
with water before using
For garnishes:
　　Sautéed daikon radish
　　Same with turnips
　　Iwatake mushrooms
　　Pine mushrooms (matsutake)
　　Shimeji mushrooms
Choose from these and serve accordingly
For suikuchi (aromatics) same as before
For bōshifu-ni and such, if prepared
in this manner the broth becomes clear
and the bowl contents extremely clean with
excellent flavor as well

　　○Miso-zuke (Miso pickled)

For this, take a considerably large fish
cut it appropriately and pickle in white miso,
then grill and serve - it is extremely
delicious. Also filleting into three pieces
and pickling is good for preparation

　　○Kasu-zuke (Sake lees pickled)

As before, take a large fish and
pickle it in sake lees

　　○Kyūzu-ae (Vinegar sauce mix)

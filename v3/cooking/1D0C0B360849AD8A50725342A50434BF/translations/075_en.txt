add it, put the aforementioned cut fish pieces into it, and when it's finished simmering, serve with grated daikon soy sauce and wasabi soy sauce.

○Same / Sukiyaki
Fillet into three pieces as usual, cut from the edge into pieces about 2 bu thick, place a metal plow (cooking implement) over the fire, and when it's well heated, wipe it with oil, then arrange the prepared fish pieces on top and grill. If the fire passes through too much, it will be bad. Grill at the table with grated daikon soy sauce and chili peppers. When there's no metal plow, a thin pot or itara shells and similar items will do.
△Yuzu soy sauce and wasabi soy sauce are both good.

○Same / Cedar board grilling
Take the fish filleted into three pieces as described above, split it lengthwise in half again, then cut it gradually from the edge and layer it, attach it to a kamaboko board, place it over the fire, and cover with a hōroku (earthenware pan) or similar from above to grill. Serve with the board when it's ready. Yuzu, wasabi, grated soy sauce and similar seasonings are excellent. This makes a very elegant presentation at the table.

Amateur Kitchen Skills Index - End

The culinary book presented here is not a formal menu. Dishes like shichigosan (7-5-3) and gogosan (5-5-3) are the domain of professional cooks. This book is intended for commoners and townspeople who are amateurs, and I hope it will serve as a guide for daily home cooking. I have categorized various menu items, thinking this might serve as a kitchen companion for occasions with unexpected guests. Though I have put some effort into this, please forgive any mistakes here and there.

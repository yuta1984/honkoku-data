○Ark shell with intestine paste
Remove the shell as usual and wash well, quickly cook with sake-salt-soy sauce, split in two and remove the intestines. Grind well some grilled tofu and a little miso, cut the meat as desired, garnish with wood ear mushrooms and mix together to serve.
《Side note: The amount of grilled tofu and miso should be adjusted according to the quantity of intestines. Too sweet is not good》

○The same / Moromi sauce
Wash as usual and remove the intestines, or leave them as is but slice thinly, put into boiling water in a cooking basket and dip four or five times, then grind the moromi well and pour over to serve. When moromi is not available, mix regular miso with soy sauce, boil once and grind well. Red miso is particularly good for this.

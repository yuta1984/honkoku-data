Coat with finest kudzu starch so it doesn't stick together,
dust well, quickly blanch
in well-boiling water, then
immediately cool in cold water to make it
like icicles, which looks magnificent.
Serve with bonito dashi soy sauce and wasabi,
etc. Vinegar-based sauces are
also good.

○Same, Fine Shreds (Soboro)
For this too, take vigorous female shellfish
and peel away the outer parts,
quickly blanch only the inner core
in well-boiling water,
then peel thinly in a circular motion
like peeling white melon.
When finished peeling, roll from the edge,
slice finely from the end, hand-
shred well to make thin, and use in clear broth
or red miso soup,
etc. It's also good to peel kamo melon, white melon,
etc. in the same way and
use together. Use as garnish for soup
or as an accompaniment.

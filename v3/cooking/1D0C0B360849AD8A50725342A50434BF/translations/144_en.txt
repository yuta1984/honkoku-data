should be used. Although one can also
grill with ordinary bones, if done
as described above, small bones will not
stick in the mouth and the taste is good.

　　○Same fish - Wax grilling (Ro-yaki)

As before, regardless of fish size,
fillet into three pieces,
remove belly bones, wrap around
skewers, first grill with
shira-yaki (plain grilling), then beat eggs and pour
over like tsuke-yaki (glazed grilling) and grill.
Distant fire is best.
When using as tori-zakana (appetizers), apply
a little salt to the flesh before grilling.
Can also be used in sweets bowls,
soups, etc.

　　○Mock Namasu (vinegared dish)

For this too, regardless of fish size,
fillet into three pieces as before,
cleanly remove belly bones,
and cut into julienne strips:

　　Wood ear mushrooms
　　Cucumber
　　Daikon radish 《Peel into hexagonal shape, slice and stack》
Arrange all three ingredients separately
in small bowls, combine nanba-su with ginger
juice and pool at the bottom
before serving. Also,
mixing a little miso into
the vinegar prepared as above is good.
When cucumber is unavailable, mitsuba (trefoil)
or celery stems work well too.

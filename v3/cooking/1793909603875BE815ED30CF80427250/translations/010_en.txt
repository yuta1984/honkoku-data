Chapter Seven: Namasu (Vinegared Dishes) Section

'Cooking Namasu' Use various fish like sea bream, shark, sand borer, flounder, carp, sweetfish, etc., add grated daikon radish and prepare. For all namasu, dress them as you would serve at a meal table. Salt seasoning is crucial. Salt should be added once with proper judgment. Adding it two or three times is bad. The seasoning should be adjusted according to what ingredients are available at the time.

'Bird Namasu' Prepare whatever ingredients, dress only the bird with vinegar first, then add sea bream and other ingredients and dress before serving. Good to add wasabi.

'Wild Goose Style Namasu' Mix various prepared fish like sand borer, flounder, carp, sweetfish, squid, etc. For this, season with vinegar and salt, dress, and set aside as appropriate.

'Open Sea Namasu' Cut horse mackerel, anchovy, etc. into rounds and add roughly cut water pepper. Mackerel is also good. Can be made with sea bream and other fish. Salt seasoning is crucial.

'Carp Roe Namasu' Fillet carp into three pieces, slice the flesh thinly, remove skin, cut finely, and immediately add roasted roe. If done too late, the roe won't stick. Mix irizake (seasoned sake) with vinegar, pour half over white sake lees namasu, mix the other half with cold vinegar and wasabi, then combine both portions before serving. However, there's also a tradition of covering all carp flesh with white sake lees.

'Crucian Carp Namasu' Fillet crucian carp into three pieces, coat bones and head with soy sauce and grill well, then pound finely. Slice the flesh very thinly, mix with roasted roe, and dress with mustard vinegar. Plain vinegar is also good. Sometimes grilled heads are served individually. In general, for namasu seasoning, it's good when there's not much excess vinegar after portioning all the namasu.

'Gizzard Shad Namasu' Same as crucian carp.

'Yamabuki Dressing' Dress crucian carp namasu with mustard-vinegar.

'Sun-Dried Namasu' Fillet sweetfish into three pieces, strain the flesh and prepare it, combine both skins and grill from the skin side, chop and add, add julienned taro stems, and dress with vinegar and salt seasoning. The skin is also grilled plain.

'Kabayaki Namasu' Can be made with ayu (sweetfish) same as sweetfish. The flesh is also strained and prepared. Skin grilled plain.

'Nuta Namasu' Grind mustard well and grind sake lees well. Whether using ayu, sardine, or catfish, first dress with vinegar, then discard that vinegar, thin the nuta with vinegar, adjust the vinegar seasoning and dress. Too much vinegar at the end is bad. However, with ayu, sometimes green beans are mixed with nuta and chopped yuzu leaves are added.

'Tarokai Namasu' Lightly salt sea bream, abalone, etc., slice very thinly, and dress with equal parts irizake and vinegar. However, add abalone later. Masu-zake (salmon) is also good. For Hanagatsubi in March, chopping and adding daikon radish, wood ear mushrooms, etc. is good.

'Grilled Bone Namasu' Grill sea bream thin flesh and bones, tear them off, add tazukuri (small dried fish), river shrimp, wood ear mushrooms, chestnuts, grated ginger, etc., and dress with vinegar-salt seasoning.

'Wasabi Dressing' Prepare wild goose or duck leg meat and dress with vinegar

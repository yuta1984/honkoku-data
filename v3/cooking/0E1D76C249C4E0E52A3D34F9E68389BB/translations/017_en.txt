If it becomes too spicy, it is not good, so it should be simmered in soy sauce to that degree. When preparing with fresh fish, use only the flesh as described above.

　　Seto Rice
Color the rice lightly with gardenia and cook as usual. Boil thin burdock root well, cut into thin rounds, and mix into the rice after it has finished cooking. Prepare the soup so that the soy sauce is not too salty, adding grated daikon radish, red pepper, dried citrus peel, and myoga mushrooms according to taste. In summer, cold soup is good; in winter, warm soup is preferable.

　　Kinnansei (Pressed Butterbur)
Peel thick butterbur stalks and leave them whole. Simmer in fresh soy sauce with red pepper added. Remove the red pepper, press and dry the butterbur, then cut into pieces about 4-bu long for use.

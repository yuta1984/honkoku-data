Select matsutake mushrooms that are still in bud form and free of insects. Clean them thoroughly, then simmer both caps and stems in raw soy sauce and dry them. While still semi-dried, cut them to use as accompaniments for sake. They can also be salt-cured and used in clear soups.

　　Satsuma Violet
Violets are found only in Hyuga and Satsuma provinces. They are thin-stemmed grasses that grow wild in fields. The roots have small round bulbs. Remove the bitter skin, wash only the roots in the river, place them in a pot, cover with a lid, seal the opening with clay, dig a hole in the garden, add rice bran, and bury the pot. Light a fire, and when it ignites during the night, take out the pot the next day, remove the lid, and stir with a ladle until it becomes paste-like. Dust this with coating powder made from bean flour and sprinkle with sugar.

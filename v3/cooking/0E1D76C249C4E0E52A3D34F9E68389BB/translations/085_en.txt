Mixed Potato Dish (Imo-zoroe)
For yamato-imo (Japanese yam), taro, and Ryukyu potato, 
remove the skins and boil them, then mash them well and add binding agent
to use like hanpei (fish cake). Kudzu starch as a binder goes bad when stored,
so wheat flour is better. Choose appropriately depending on 
the ingredient.

　　Flounder Mix (Karei-ae)
Take only the roe from steamed flounder, grill it until there is no moisture,
then crush it and mix with sliced raw fish. Use by adding to irizake (seasoned sake) or directly to dishes.

　　Pine Mushroom Tofu (Matsutake Tofu)
Add a little soy sauce to bonito dashi and dissolve in miso. Bring to a boil
over charcoal fire and add cut tofu. If for dinner, start preparing
from the morning.

Grind and add wood ear mushrooms, burdock root, and mung bean sprouts (the method for making sprouts is described next). Stir-fry in oil, spread on yuba, roll and season. In Nagasaki, it's not called "Ken-chien" unless mung bean sprouts are added. For fish, use tai (sea bream), sawara (Spanish mackerel), shellfish, etc., depending on the season. Cut finely, stir-fry in oil, cook eggs and roll. All are similar preparations.

　　Mung Bean Sprouts
Put eight parts water and four parts sand in a mortar. Sow mung beans in the sand, put in a heated room one day ahead, let sit overnight until sprouts emerge, then harvest and use.

　　Fuji-ae (Fuji-style Dressed Dish)
Briefly blanch only the white parts of green onions, add sesame miso, and make white dressed salad with tofu. Sprout potatoes are also good.

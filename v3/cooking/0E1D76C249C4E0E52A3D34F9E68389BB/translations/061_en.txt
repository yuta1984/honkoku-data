Soak dried salmon in water to soften. Remove water from the front portion to the extent that it's not over-soaked. Cut into pieces of 1 sun by 1.5 sun, about 1 bu thick, removing the skin and using only the flesh. Marinate in salt-free sushi. Add long eggplant and pickled vegetables. This provides the salt content.

　　Seaweed (Nanoriso)
Remove the saltiness from hondawara seaweed, boil in hot water, and dress with spicy miso. Green hondawara is good. Black ones are tough.

　　Tazukuri Salad
Roast gomame (small dried sardines), immediately soak in hot water and let sit for a while. When you can fillet them into three pieces, take only the flesh. Remove bones and heads. Boil burdock root, pound it, and shred finely. Mix both ingredients together with Japanese pepper and soy sauce. The soy sauce won't penetrate immediately, so it's better to let it sit for a day before using.

　　Genji Persimmon
Remove the skin from kneaded persimmons, split them flat into two pieces, and remove the seeds. Coat with wheat flour batter and deep-fry in oil.

　　Twisted Sea Bream
Fillet sea bream, add salt and grind it, spread on a cutting board to shape it, then twist it for soup. It's also good as white salad with vinegar-miso.

　　Millet Matsutake
Remove the stems from half-opened matsutake mushrooms, wash only the caps and clean them well, then stuff millet inside the caps. Steam and top with kudzu starch and ginger.

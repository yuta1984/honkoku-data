　　Sakata rice porridge pickles
Cook white rice to the consistency of watery porridge. Add salt, but 
too much salt is not good. Mountain butterbur - this is butterbur that 
grows naturally in the mountains. The size is about one inch across. 
Boil and rinse. Bamboo shoots - in Sakata there are no large bamboo. 
These are also boiled. Bracken fern - remarkable. Length is three to 
four shaku. No branches, and the leaves are blue, resembling shiso.
Sweetfish - this is also remarkable.

Cut one side of fried tofu, turn it inside out, stuff with boiled adzuki beans, skewer it, brush with soy sauce and grill.

　　Grated Eggplant Soup
Peel the eggplant, cut in half, soak in water to remove bitterness, then grate and squeeze out the liquid for miso soup. It's good to use plenty of eggplant. Add mustard when serving.

　　Arare Soba-kiri (Hail-style Cut Noodles)
Hull five-year-old rice, pound it white, and make tea rice without salt - not too hard, not too soft, the consistency is crucial. Steam it lightly, transfer to a bamboo basket, and place over a tub. When good sencha tea is freshly boiled, pour it over the rice. This removes the stickiness from the rice. Also hang the basket over the tea kettle to steam. Serve the rice transferred to dishes from the kitchen. The dipping sauce and pickles are the same as for soba noodles. No matter how much you eat, it won't fill your stomach.

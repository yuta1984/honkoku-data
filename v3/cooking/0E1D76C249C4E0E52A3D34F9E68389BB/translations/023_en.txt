Osprey Sushi
There is a bird called osprey (misago) at the seashore. It dives into the sea to catch fish, places them on tree branches, urinates on them, then dives into the sea again to catch more fish - repeating this process many times. When these fish are pickled as sushi, the taste is delicious. If you take the fish from the branch from below, the osprey doesn't mind, but if you take them from above, it will never bring fish to stack on this tree again. The method of pickling the sushi has no particular special requirements.
　According to one theory, when the osprey catches and eats fish in the sea and becomes satiated, it hides the remaining fish between rocks and after some time passes, goes into the crevice to eat them. This is said to be called "osprey's sushi."

　　Steamed Bun Light Meal
Place two warm steamed buns in a confection bowl, cover with a lid, put pepper powder in an origami paper fold, and serve with chopsticks. Take the steamed bun with chopsticks, hold it in your left hand and eat. When you no longer want any, put the lid back on the bowl.

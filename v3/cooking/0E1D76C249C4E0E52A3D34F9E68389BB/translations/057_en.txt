Bamboo Shoot Soup
Finely chop the soft white inner skin from the tip of bamboo shoot husks into needle-thin strips. It's best to use quite a lot. Use the husk, not the bamboo itself. Serve with miso soup, garnished with rock mushrooms.

Pine Cone Tofu
Remove the cloth marks from tofu and cut into pieces about 5 bu thick (approximately 1.5cm). Make cuts like a pine cone, but ensure the pieces don't separate. Boil in hot water, scoop with a mesh ladle, and pour thin miso mixed with ground udo root over it. This gives it the fragrance of pine cones. The miso goes into the cuts.

Roasted Abalone
Cut abalone into large pieces, wrap in a cloth to remove moisture. Sprinkle salt on a houroku (earthenware roasting pan), roast the abalone and set aside. Green

Beginning with Kuni-no-Tokotachi-no-Mikoto, through the teaching of the chicken egg, heaven and earth began to open, and there were ten billion mountains, one of which was named Mount Sumeru. The rest were surrounded by endless waters, with wind beneath having no bottom. Mount Sumeru was divided into four parts and named east, west, south, and north. The three countries of Tenjiku (India), Shintan (China), and our court (Japan) are all in the south. There are two mountains in each of the four directions: in the east, Mount Dairyu and Mount Kokou; in the west, Mount Gyu (one mountain); in the south, Mount Zoubana and Mount Batou; in the north, Mount Shishi and Mount Kirin. In the center is Mount Omintatsura, which is the main mountain.

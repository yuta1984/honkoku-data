[Omitting the overlapping portion from the previous page]
We were at a complete loss as to what to do when palanquins
and other preparations arrived from Tayasu to escort us, so we agreed that it would be best to go
to that location. We arranged male and female attendants
to ensure there would be no inconvenience, and from Takasago Gate,
the lord departed by palanquin in increasingly good spirits
for the evacuation, which filled us with great relief. After his departure, the fire
continued to spread extensively, and both
palace buildings, storehouses, and all gates were completely
destroyed by fire before dawn,
truly a terrifying sight that left us speechless.
While the fire had not yet been extinguished, we thought it best to promptly
notify your inner and outer circles, but we were unable
to prepare a detailed written report. However, when Dennosuke arrives,
he will have detailed firsthand knowledge of the previous events, so we agreed that
a written report would not be necessary.
After paying respects to His Lordship, I departed before dawn
and came here. Subsequently, from the evening of the 6th, regarding
reports to Inoue Zenbei and others in your inner and outer circles,
I also urgently wanted to send word and dispatch
a brief note to the lodgings informing of our safety.
However, due to various pressing matters, especially since
even writing brushes, paper, and ink were lost to fire, I finally
procured these items and temporarily wrote down
what I witnessed locally in two or three lines each, sending
a letter to my son on the 10th via
express foot messenger. Since I was unable to prepare
individual letters for close relatives, I wrote requesting that
the contents of this letter be properly conveyed
to everyone. Accordingly, I expected that Dennosuke and Zenbei,
having knowledge of the basic situation, would gradually
inform you of the details in the private correspondence with my son.
However, both of them
apparently returned from their travels, and while I thought
they would send word to you from their journey,
since they gradually returned to the capital, I understand it is quite reasonable
that they should send detailed information through
detailed written correspondence. I imagine you have already
received detailed information
from various reports from here and there, but
I am submitting the attached list of deaths and injuries, as well as
the written report from the walking inspector. Regarding the nearby fire damage and such

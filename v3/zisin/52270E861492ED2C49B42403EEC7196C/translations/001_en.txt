Furthermore, though it may be presumptuous to write this in a postscript,
I humbly rejoice to hear that His Lordship also
returned in good health to the Tameike residence
around the fifth hour of morning on the 7th.

I received and read your esteemed letter sent on the 14th of last month. First,
I humbly rejoice that His Lordship is in excellent health and
arrived in Edo the day before yesterday, the 7th.
I also respectfully acknowledge that you are in good health
and performing your duties admirably.

Now, regarding the unprecedented great earthquake here,
more than half of the residence collapsed and
everything was subsequently lost to fire. I inquired in detail
about this matter through Tokunaga Dennosuke and subsequently
through Inoue Zenbei as well, but both
had to return while still traveling, and
since the official correspondence from your colleagues alone
could not convey the full details of the actual events,
I was instructed to provide you with a detailed account.

On the night of the 2nd of the same month, around the fourth hour, while I had not yet fallen asleep,
a strange sound echoed, followed by a violent upward thrust
from below with fierce sudden shaking. Realizing this was a great earthquake,
I barely had time to put on my swords at my pillow
before rushing out through the ceremonial entrance without time to put on hakama.
After proceeding about one ken down the corridor,
everything near and far, above and below, front and back, left and right simultaneously
crashed and fell with such force that it truly shattered one's nerves.
The lamp went out from the impact, and as I tried to proceed by touch,
a beam-like object immediately fell and blocked my path, preventing any forward movement.
I then tried to exit through the middle gate of the inner courtyard,
but turning back, I found the rear similarly blocked by fallen debris.
Confused about how to proceed, I called out to ask about the condition
of the servants. Hearing their panicked voices
as they came searching for me, I used their voices as a guide
and finally managed to get outside the building.

Looking around, I saw that the front guard quarters and
more than half of the main residence had collapsed, creating
an unobstructed view all the way to Yamashita Gate.
Soon after, fires broke out behind the stables, at the Choshu
residence, or in the northeast direction.
With the northwest wind blowing, it appeared that our residence
might be safe due to the diagonal wind direction, but in any case,
this was such an unexpected great disaster that
I was deeply concerned about His Lordship's living quarters.
Wishing to inquire about your safety, I left all matters concerning
the building's furnishings to the servants and set out alone
toward the formal reception hall.

[Omitting the overlapping portion from the previous page]
The walls and fences of the residences along the path had collapsed,
and stepping over them or crawling under them, I finally
reached the vicinity of the steward's quarters, where both the right and
left sides had collapsed, making the path indiscernible. The formal reception hall's
ceremonial entrance area was similarly collapsed and blocked, so
I went outside the gate and tried to approach from
the direction of the original residence gate. Along the way, I unexpectedly
encountered Sato Kyuhei,
who informed me that His Lordship was in good health and
had evacuated to the outer garden area.
This brought me great relief. I then climbed over the collapsed
walls and fences of the outer garden's outer gate, and found
that he was resting peacefully
under the wisteria trellis inside Takasago Gate,
with his attending ladies-in-waiting protecting him.
Though this was an unexpected great disaster, seeing him in such a state
late at night was both awesome and deeply moving.
However, given the unavoidable circumstances, while we were attending to him
with various concerns about preventing him from catching cold, soon
fire spread to the residence, igniting various locations. Around that time,
starting from the Kuchiki residence and continuing to the Ito
residence area and other places, fires broke out. Until past midnight,
it appeared that the formal reception hall
would remain safe, but all the well water was blocked by collapsed buildings,
firefighting equipment had already been lost to flames, and not a single
firefighter arrived from outside. We could only
fold our hands and pray to Heaven's providence. Even if only the formal reception hall remained,
we had agreed that
evacuation would not be necessary, but the fire's intensity
spread and extended even to areas not downwind,
and finally reached the formal reception hall as well. Under such circumstances, before dawn,
we agreed that it would be better to evacuate
somewhere. However, the Tameike middle residence was not
in a condition to accommodate anyone, the Ogi residence was more than half collapsed,
the Kashima residence was extremely cramped at the time, and we thought
the Hasuike residence might be suitable, but the palanquin and other
procession equipment had all been lost to fire, so in any case

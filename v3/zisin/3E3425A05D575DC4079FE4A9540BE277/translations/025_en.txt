Fourth month of the year of the Sheep　　　　　　　　Takagi Seizaemon

First, regarding my territory, as I previously reported, due to the great earthquake, Iwakura Mountain within Hirabayashi Village in Sarashina District collapsed and was pushed into the Sai River, creating dams at two locations where water gradually accumulated to a depth of several tens of jō. Although water had been leaking for the past day or two, because it was riding over the dam site downstream, there was still more than two jō of water remaining. However, it appears the dam suddenly burst, and yesterday on the 13th after seven o'clock in the evening, the mountain area shook violently, followed by the loud sound of rushing water. Torrential water suddenly rushed out along the river course, immediately breaking through or overflowing the embankments on both sides, with flood control measures proving inadequate, as reported in succession by river officials. Soon after, dozens of villages in Kawanakajima were completely flooded, with water flowing into the Chikuma River and creating a backflow that reached nearly to the castle grounds. From evening until around nine o'clock, the Chikuma River rose about two jō above normal levels, submerging not only Kawanakajima but also villages along rivers in Takai and Minochi districts. There were several locations where new channels appeared to have formed. Crops were naturally covered in mud, and there appear to be numerous places that were carved out by the rushing water, though it was difficult to assess the full extent. Even past midnight, the water level seemed to continue rising like a tide.

Ruining Iiyama, the Honda affair
　　What to do? Fleeing and tumbling
Many people gathered and fell to hell
　　Even dying is Shinano's Amida temple exhibition
Even Enma's eyeballs that would pull out tongues
　　Were plucked out by people - Honda's mistake
These days even Enma tells lies, it seems
　　With his eyeballs plucked out, what about Shōzuka?
Granny Shōzuka's reply poem
Even if plucked out, they're just eyeballs, no big deal
　　Just cried with my tongue, it's still a lower matter

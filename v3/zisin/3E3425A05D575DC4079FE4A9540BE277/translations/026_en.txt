By dawn, the water gradually began to recede. Although I had previously ordered the villagers to prepare flood control measures, the sudden outburst of this unprecedented swift and massive flood was beyond expectation. Not only were houses swept away, but there appear to be many drowning victims as well. Furthermore, I am deeply concerned that extensive damage will result. I will investigate the details and report them later, but first I am reporting this situation. The above.

April 14th　　　　　　　　　　Sanada Shinano-no-kami

Regarding my territory of Matsushiro that I previously reported, on the night of the 24th of last month, due to an unprecedented great earthquake, one turret within the castle collapsed from the shaking, and other turrets, gates, surrounding walls, and residential buildings suffered major damage. Moreover, the ground cracked in various places, with fissures about seven to eight sun wide extending for several ken in lines. Regarding the retainers' residences, those located toward the southern hills suffered lighter damage, but there were collapsed houses, half-collapsed houses, and other uniformly damaged places. In the castle town as well, there were collapsed houses, damaged places, and deaths. In addition, the villages throughout the domain suffered similarly, with ground cracks of seven to eight sun or one to two shaku deep extending for several ken in lines depending on the location, from which earth, sand, muddy water, and burnt stones erupted. Also, in the rice fields and farmland, the ground became variously altered, rising high in some places and sinking low in others. Furthermore, in the mountain areas, landslides were even more severe, and some villages were completely buried in earth.

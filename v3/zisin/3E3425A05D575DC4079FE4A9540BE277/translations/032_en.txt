The floodwaters surged into the farmlands. The water depth in that area reached over six jō, so among the riverside villages, Yotsuya Village in Sarashina District had only six or seven houses remaining out of eighty households, with virtually all others swept away, leaving the site as nothing but a riverbed. Many villages similarly had all their houses swept away without exception. Moreover, in the mountain areas, many mountains collapsed due to water damage, causing large trees to be swept down, which in turn knocked down and destroyed many houses. The destroyed houses number approximately six hundred or more, and there are many others filled with stones, sand, mud, and water. There are reports of drowning victims, but the details are still unclear.

Furthermore, among the downstream villages, the low-lying farmlands still have water pooled to a depth of about one jō, making it impossible to even roughly assess the extent of the damaged land. The three post stations - Tanbajima on the Hokukoku Highway and Kawada and Fukushima on the Hokukoku side route - cannot provide relay horses and porters due to the aforementioned circumstances.

Regarding rice and grain in the riverside villages, although we had previously ordered their transfer to mountain villages, many other nearby villages had prepared shelves and stored grain on them, believing that even if water came, it would not cause complete loss. However, not a few of these storage facilities were swept away along with the houses. As relief measures for the villages, we dispatched officials to various locations to organize food distribution and temporary shelter arrangements. Particularly in the Kawanakajima villages, three irrigation channels that drew water from the Sai River, plus one water gate, have been completely buried without a trace, leaving no drinking water at all. For relief food preparation, depending on the location, water must be transported from distances of twenty to thirty chō away.

Ultimately, regarding the previously mentioned embankment construction work, in order to prevent such disasters in the future as emergency flood prevention measures, even the people from villages whose houses were destroyed by the earthquake are working diligently day by day to build them up, without waiting for orders.

They have no means and face shortages of food supplies. Among the households, the heads of families perished in the collapsed houses, leaving behind only elderly people and young children. Even relatives and family connections have fallen into similar circumstances of extreme hardship. We have no choice but to have the villages take them in and provide care, but villages that are themselves destitute cannot provide adequate assistance. My deputies report from their village rounds that there are villages requesting loans and other forms of aid. After investigating each case, I am currently arranging to distribute loans from our stored grain reserves: four gō of hulled rice per day for men, and two gō each for women and those over sixty or under fifteen years of age, limited to periods of twenty or thirty days. I will report the total amounts later. For those without means to construct temporary shelters, I am arranging assistance using funds from my office's permanent reserve fund and the fund for the poor, helping them get by. As for villages where rice fields and farmland have been damaged by broken reservoir embankments, landslides, and mudflows, I should earnestly encourage restoration efforts, but the enormous costs involved are beyond their means, and poor villages face difficulties even with house construction expenses and other needs, making it a matter of village-wide survival. I will need to investigate these cases progressively and make inquiries, but for now I am reporting the relief measures taken to help them through the immediate crisis. The above.

We have no choice but to use the grain reserves from the district granaries, having our agents distribute them and make rounds of the villages to help people survive. For villages closest to the administrative office, we have set up temporary shelters in the precincts of temples and shrines in Nakano Village and Matsukawa Village to provide relief for those in extreme difficulty.

Furthermore, when we gradually investigated the deaths and injuries of people, cattle, and horses in the villages, the male and female fatalities numbered 578 as shown in the written report, with 1,460 injured. Among these, many have become disabled and unable to engage in farming or make a living. Two cattle and fifty horses died.

In addition, there were over 200 men and women who had made pilgrimages to Zenkoji Temple, stayed there on the night of March 24th, and died in fires caused by the earthquake. Due to such losses, the population has been decimated, and in the disaster-affected villages, the population registry shows a decrease of 2.7 percent. Of the over 58,300 koku in assessed rice production under my jurisdiction, only three-tenths remains in undamaged villages, while over seven-tenths represents villages affected by disaster—a truly lamentable situation.

Immediately, if we do not repair the irrigation channels in the villages, there will be problems with drinking water, and since this is a crucial time for irrigation water for rice fields and other crops, if we do not attend to repairs without delay, not only rice seedbeds but also planting in undamaged fields will be affected. However, the area is vast and the damage extensive—far beyond what the villages can handle through mutual cooperation alone. Unlike fire disasters, this is a great catastrophe that has affected not only buildings but also rice fields, other farmland, and mountain forests.

Particularly in both Minochi and Takai counties, the damage from the great earthquake is extremely severe. If left unattended, many villages will become completely abandoned wastelands. This affects human life and will result in the loss of future tax revenues and national benefit—a serious matter that requires relief assistance, without which nothing can be done.

Also, this earthquake affected the ferry crossing at Tanbajima Village on the Hokukoku Highway.

　　　　　　Same, 16th day, reported

In my territory of Shikaya Village in Sarashina County, Shinano Province, and the divided land of Hinana Village, at a mountain valley called Takachigawa on the border with Matsudaira Tamba-no-kami's territory, after the great earthquake on the night of March 24th of this year, there have been frequent strong tremors, and mountains have gradually collapsed and slid. Water has accumulated in that mountain valley, and it has buried and blocked an area of over fifty ken in width and about five ken in height above the current water level. About four cho downstream, at the divided land of Soshitsu-gumi in Hinana Village, at a place called Denkoyama, and at the divided land of Saroku Village in Tamba-no-kami's territory on the western mountainside across the valley, similar collapses occurred simultaneously, burying and blocking that valley for about two cho in width and about six ken in height. Therefore, I wish to order excavation work, but the mountain roads are treacherous, with collapses in several locations, barely allowing single-file passage. Moreover, it involves digging and burying massive rocks, making proper execution impossible. Should the blocked area break and surge out all at once, it would flow into the Sai River

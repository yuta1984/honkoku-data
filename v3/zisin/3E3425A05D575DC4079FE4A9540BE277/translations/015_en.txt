While staying there, around 4 o'clock on the night of March 24th, there was an unprecedented great earthquake.
Shiozaki Village is a village with a kokudaka of over 2,800 koku of rice, and reportedly had a total of 600 houses.
Of these, counting the main houses as well as storehouses and storage buildings, the surveyed number of structures was 1,100,
with approximately 60-70% of houses collapsed, as investigated and reported by the territorial officials. Regarding injuries,
there were many people affected, with approximately 60 immediate deaths reported, but by the time we departed
from that place, there were also dead bodies being dug out from the collapsed houses one after another. Of course, regarding travelers,
the number could not be determined immediately. Our own lodging also collapsed in the earthquake, and we barely escaped with our lives,
but our luggage and other belongings were trapped under the house, and we had to dig them out when dawn broke the next morning.
Regarding Shiozaki Village, there were no fires, with only two or three houses lost to burning. During the earthquake,
fires broke out simultaneously in all directions near and far, dust clouds rose up together, and throughout the night dozens of
times there were mountain rumblings, countless human voices, and the strong sound of falling rocks. Rice fields and
roads alike cracked both lengthwise and crosswise from about 2-3 shaku to 4-5 shaku in width, with water gushing out,
or what seemed like mud spurting forth. In places where the earth
split, there were step-like differences of about 2 shaku, and places where mud and soil gushed out had
an extremely bad smell, possibly containing sulfurous vapors. However, places where water gushed out
had no smell.

Item: From the 10th of last month, due to the Zenkoji temple exhibition, countless pilgrims from various provinces stayed overnight.
During this time, 1,240 people stayed at a single inn, of which 1,200 were
accommodated by the inn proper, while the remaining 40 stayed for free. During this time of such crowding,
the great earthquake struck, and Zenkoji town was severely damaged by the earthquake, with additional fires causing deaths

We should implement measures for field development, but if we leave it only to the retainers, it will affect the feelings of the domain residents, and recovery efforts will not be pursued vigorously. Regarding this matter, until the villages within the domain recover even slightly and the people's spirits become calm enough to reach a state where they engage in farming,
I wish to remain in the locality to handle relief measures and assistance, and naturally to encourage the people's morale in multiple ways, as well as to provide comprehensive guidance on control measures and other matters.
If this could be granted, through your special benevolence, I would like to be excused from attending the capital until this autumn.
Would it be acceptable to formally submit a petition for this? I am sending word to inquire about each of your private thoughts on this matter. The above.

April 16th　　　　　Retainer of Sanada Shinano-no-kami
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Tsuda Ten

Attached Note
A formal petition should be submitted to the monthly duty officer.

As reported progressively above, due to the great earthquake in Shinano Province, complaints were filed that there were collapsed and swept-away houses in my magistrate's territory of Kuiseshimo Village in Hanishina District and 26 other villages. When I dispatched my deputy to inspect and investigate, around the fourth hour of night on the 24th of last month, there was an extraordinarily rare great earthquake. Everyone became agitated, wondering whether they should evacuate their residences, but the earthquake was so severe that even walking was difficult.

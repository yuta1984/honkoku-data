Water also surged considerably into the castle town. Due to these circumstances, from the downstream riverside villages to the shogunal territory around Nakano-daira, everything was filled with water, appearing like a lake. As the water gradually receded, I immediately sent out inspection teams. However, most bridges large and small were washed away, and even after the water receded, there were places where water remained pooled in low-lying areas, or where roads were gouged out, making passage difficult. It is impossible even to make rough estimates of the damage.

Regarding the collapse of the dam site on the Sai River: the water level gradually increased, reaching a depth of twenty jō, and as the water slowly rose, the foothills of Mount Iwakura progressively eroded and collapsed, creating new water channels. When the great flood began, the massive rocks and stones that had been blocking the river were simultaneously swept away and collapsed, causing extensive erosion into the foothills as well. The water that had been dammed for several tens of days then burst forth into Kawanakajima. To prevent this, we hastily constructed emergency flood control earthworks using stone-filled baskets on both sides of the embankments downstream from the ferry crossing at Koichi Village in Minochi District. However, since this was for the benefit of Kawanakajima and other riverside shogunal territories and private domain villages, we mobilized not only workers from within the domain but also large numbers from neighboring villages that might be affected by flooding, and worked with all our might on the construction. But the tremendous force of the water swept it away almost immediately.

Furthermore, Mount Magami in Koichi Village, Minochi District, had previously collapsed, with a section about twenty kan high and fifty kan wide extending about eighty kan into the Sai River, leaving only a narrow channel width remaining. If left as it was, even the remaining water would cause the river course to change, so we worked diligently to excavate it, but there were many large rocks and stones that we could not adequately handle. However, this recent torrential flood instantly swept them away, carrying massive boulders that would require several hundred men to move into the downstream areas and riverside villages.

The above represents the disaster conditions in the villages of Takai County and Minochi County in Shinano Province, which are currently under my custody as deputy administrator, following the great earthquake on the night of March 24th of this year. I am submitting this urgent report. I immediately dispatched supervisors and clerks, and personally toured the villages to inspect the disaster conditions. What I witnessed was truly beyond description—a terrifying and unbearable sight. The ground split open in linear cracks ranging from 7-8 sun to 5-6 shaku wide, extending for dozens of ken, with massive amounts of black and red muddy water gushing forth from these cracks, making many areas impassable on foot. Moreover, landslides occurred in various places with soil and water rushing out, large boulders tumbling down, transforming both rice fields and farmland into unusable terrain, with extensive damaged land visible, and village irrigation channels collapsing in many places.

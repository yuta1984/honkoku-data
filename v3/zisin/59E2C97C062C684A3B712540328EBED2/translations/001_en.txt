Everyone
〽Although we accept that these great earthquakes are natural disasters and resign ourselves to them, what we cannot accept is that our businesses have become truly quiet and we are troubled. Please, through your favorable weather, may our work become busy again. We pray to you, Namu Tentō-sama (Heaven), all of us together.

Tentō (Heaven)
〽Now, now, everyone, do not worry so much about earthquakes. Even if entertainment businesses are slow, do not fret. Look at this - if you take a hoe in hand and work as an assistant to plasterers, work will continue and you will earn money. Do not worry, but quickly take up these tools and make your way in the world - this is what I show you.

Everyone
〽We say, Kashima-sama, don't you know? That you would shake [the earth] like this - we truly, truly cannot understand it. Earthquakes affect everyone in society and cannot be helped, but you have that reliable stone called the kaname-ishi (keystone). What is the purpose of it? If it's going to shake like this anyway, why is it a keystone? If it's such a useless stone, it would be better to knock it down completely. That all of us together complained to Kashima-sama is quite reasonable.

Shinto Priest
〽Now, now, what everyone says is quite reasonable, but if you become angry like this, we will be in great, great trouble. Please accept this as the work of natural disaster. Also, if you destroy such an important stone, our priestly duties will increase, so please, we humbly beg your forgiveness - the priest apologized looking very troubled.

【Right branch・from bottom to top】
Great earthquake
　　　　　Nowhere to evacuate to
　　　　Many deaths and the laments of parents and children
　　　Epidemics spreading from earth poison
　　Words of construction workers
　Suddenly breaking bones
His benevolence is grateful

【Central trunk portion】
The time was the night of the second day of Kannazuki in the second year of Ansei, Kinoto-U year, about the great earthquake

【Left branch・from top to bottom】
Money exchange rates falling
　Entertainers' poor harvest
　　Collapsed houses become firewood
　　　Unavoidably, even masters do unfamiliar work
　　　　Bodies crushed, caught between beams
　　　　　Be patient, things will improve soon
Fires breaking out

In the Nihon Shoki, Volume 22, under the seventh year of Empress Suiko's reign, it states: "Summer, fourth month, first day kinoto-hitsuji, day kanoto-tori, the earth shook and houses were completely destroyed. Thereupon [the empress] ordered the four directions to worship the earthquake deity." The term "earthquake deity" appears here, but since the specific name is not revealed, we cannot know what kind of deity it was. In the Shoku Nihongi, Volume 30, under Empress Shōtoku's fourth year of Jingo-keiun era, it states: "Sixth month, day kinoe-tora, epidemic deities were worshipped at the four corners of the capital and the ten boundaries of the Kinai region." Also in Volume 31, under Emperor Kōnin's second year of Hōki era: "Third month, day mizunoe-inu, [the emperor] ordered all provinces under heaven to worship epidemic deities." While this does not relate to earthquakes, let me temporarily cite examples from national histories for comparison.

When we examine this, it appears that rather than designating specific deities mentioned in the sacred texts as earthquake deities or epidemic deities, they believed there were deities who move the earth and deities who bring epidemics, and named these deities "earthquake deities" and "epidemic deities" to have them worshipped. Now, looking at the Hoki Naiden: (While Hoki is attributed to Abe no Seimei, there are theories that it is a forgery, so relying on this may be questionable. However, since in those times there was no one who did not rely on Buddhist teachings, many written works were based on Buddhist doctrine. Since Hoki also appears to be based on Buddhist teachings, even if the attribution to Seimei is false, given that it mentions calendar annotations, it must surely be a work of the onmyōji tradition.) The epidemic deity is Gozu Tennō. What are worshipped as epidemic deities in various places up to the present day are all Gozu

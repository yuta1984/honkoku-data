If there are places where divine virtue is not bestowed, then the god's power rages violently, night mist fills with fragrance, and thus the earth sways and moves.

The evidence for this is that two or three days beforehand, ships crossing the seas have no wind in their sails, or when mist fills and threatens rain, sailors know these omens. Flocks of birds unable to fly in the sky, and the flickering flames of travelers sleeping on bedding spread on the main roads - all of this is due to the absence of wind. As I already think, earthquake omens are also the same: when people nearby cannot see above half their bodies, or when rainbow shadows appear reflected in sunlight - all follow the same principle. How could there be a principle where earth qi rises for three or even seven days before then falling greatly? Pour moisture onto everything scorched by earth and observe: even when water surges violently, it does not form nourishing rough water. This should be understood even without explaining everything about water. In recent years, I consider it most fearsome to contemplate even the high price of grain.

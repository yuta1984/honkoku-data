The Meaning of the Initial Engagement (Tachiai)
The essence of the sumo initial engagement is originally "nothingness" (mu-ichimotsu). When there is action, it is emptiness. "Being" means knowing the enemy. To know the enemy means to understand the opponent's strengths, weaknesses, advantages and disadvantages. Gathering this into one and standing with patience - techniques are thus teachings beyond scripture. Do not win with techniques. It is only the single move of the heart. Just as there are ways to become Buddha outside of sutras, if one's spirit is not calm, techniques will change and become dangerous. If the foundation is disturbed, the end cannot be perfected. Therefore, "immobility" means the heart does not move. To simply endure with single-mindedness uses the character for patience and forbearance. One must not think of necessarily winning. Understand that you must not lose. Even momentary flashiness is great emptiness. Sincerity is achieved without thinking, as someone's poem says:
"Whatever words we contrive are false - in wind-like memories there may be truth"

The Reality and Illusion of Seven Bodies and Seven Feet △ Strength, Weakness, Reality and Illusion
When strong, one is necessarily weak. The strong do not necessarily win. The weak do not necessarily lose. When something appears empty, it is necessarily substantial. All techniques involve transformations of strength, weakness, reality and illusion. In life-or-death sword combat, one cannot learn through practice or achieve through thinking - only the subtle arts of training emerge. Moreover, when training diligently every day without neglect, the subtle arts emerge, and when one reaches that level, both enemy and self can clearly distinguish strength, weakness, reality and illusion.
Therefore, each person's subtle arts - each individual has their strengths, and each heart differs.

The Form of Strong-Soft and Weak-Hard
Even with great physical strength, if one's spirit is soft, strength is held in reserve. Though appearing weak, internally one is stalwart. For example, sizing up an opponent and responding accordingly to that degree - even if changes emerge, one loses the original heart. This is called strong-soft, weak-hard. Let the heart not change. The dignity of an ōzeki comes first - guard this.

The Form of Being and Non-Being
Know the foundation of change and understand the enemy's strength and weakness. When there is being, have a heart of non-being; when there is non-being, have a heart of being. Simply the heart that does not neglect conquering oneself - knowing what to know. When an enemy attacks the body, it is non-being; when winning, it is being. All from below the navel...

[Upper margin notes]
Officials wore haori jackets, and attendants carried half-staffs and jitte. Foot soldiers wore happi coats and hakama trousers, carrying staffs. Now sumo begins, with retainers and spectators entering and leaving through the Fumei Gate. In autumn of Tempō 8 (1837), taking the occasion of finding this document in a box, I record it here. The viewing location and such represented the height of prosperity, with all ordered to attend as spectators.

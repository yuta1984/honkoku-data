"Prepare to face the enemy of our father and elder brother!" No sooner had he said this than he cut [Mizuemon] in half from the head to below the nose. The younger brother declared "I am Genzō!" and made a dramatic cut from the shoulder. We brothers, aged thirty-three and thirty, accomplished our long-cherished desire on this day. This was entirely due to the blessings of Buddha and the gods, or perhaps the spiritual power of our deceased father and elder brother from beyond the grave, so we joined our hands and bowed in all four directions.

Then they tied the letter they had written to Mizuemon's hakama at the waist, and both brothers quickly departed toward the outside of the castle. The page was so shocked he nearly fell into the moat, but managed to crawl up and, having witnessed the entire incident, immediately reported to his lord. When the letter was opened, it detailed everything that had happened since Osaka, recording not only their false and real names, but even the inscriptions on their swords and wakizashi in great detail. [The lord] deliberated for about two hours on whom to send in pursuit before finally giving orders, which everyone admired as truly deep consideration.

The two men stayed for three or four days in the pine grove they had previously agreed upon, listening to rumors from travelers on the road. Determining that there was no longer concern about pursuit, they sent their retainer back to their home province. The two brothers had previously gone to erase their names from the official records in the Kansai region, but at Sakano-shita station they encountered a samurai who appeared to hold five or six hundred koku traveling down from Edo. They said, "We have a small request - due to such circumstances we have just departed. We haven't slept for three nights and are extremely tired, so please provide us shelter to rest for a while." The samurai replied "We are in the same situation" and let them sleep in the back room of a teahouse for about half a day. As evening approached, he ordered food and took out about ten ryō in gold, saying "Though it may seem insufficient, please use this to cover your expenses."

Then [the brothers] said "Your recent kindness is unforgettable. We also have some savings" and took out about one hundred ryō to show him. [The samurai] said "You are truly reliable in your methods. Well then," and they exchanged courtesies and parted ways, heading north and south.

Now, Shimotsuke-no-kami, the son of Lord Aoyama Inaba-no-kami, had returned to Hamamatsu Castle in Enshū province, so when the two or three men returned, he rejoiced greatly at these unparalleled individuals. He granted the elder brother Hanzō his father's original stipend of 250 koku, and the younger brother Genzō a new stipend of 200 koku, had their residences strictly enclosed, and assigned guards to each.

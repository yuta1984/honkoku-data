This is because it serves as entertainment for the peaceful realm under heaven. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that it flourishes in the end. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that lead to compromising and flattering, thus disrupting the ancient laws. When attempting to reform now, it may instead bring misfortune. Alas, they do not understand the fundamentals.

Those who make sumo their profession travel throughout the provinces, and with people of any region, they form relationships as masters or friends, treating each other especially like parent and child - this is the proper way. They should constantly seek guidance from the virtuous to correct the ancient ways of sumo, maintain the proper conduct, etiquette, and formal structure of sumo, and must never follow the vulgar customs of a debased world and enter the wrong path.

Looking at the current state of affairs, though one might say it's due to the times, even if their technique is immature, if they are large in build and good in form, they are made into sekitori and everyone respectfully bows to them. Consequently, they become very ignorant of the true meaning of things, forget their proper place, and assert their own will. The abbreviated transmission states: "Having strength but despising the law is the foundation of disorder. Having strength and following the law is the instrument of good governance. This too should be decided uniformly." "Having strength" refers to the mindset of being a true wrestler. "Despising the law" means disregarding the words of referees and elders - this is the beginning of the disruption of proper form. Also, when many people climb the ladder (hashigo), there is no proper control. When one has strength and follows the law, it becomes an instrument of good governance.

The tools and etiquette would be as in ancient times. The point is to maintain this single-mindedly. As with today's matches, the referee's fan becomes a hindrance, and both sides lose their composure, thus losing their proper stance. Because the fundamentals are not cultivated, they only look at their own convenience and argue much. Since the elders and referees do not weigh matters with sincere hearts, judgments are never decided. Referees also lose the ancient laws and follow what has become distorted. For example, when wrestlers are strong, they draw crowds of spectators. Since this is their livelihood, they consider this the highest good. Here the law naturally becomes disordered.

The abbreviated transmission says: "Do not consider the referee's office easy. Therefore, generation after generation, those who do not find sumo difficult but find being a referee difficult are also similar to the parable of the fine horse and Bole." That the referee's office is not easy is because it is the true administration of sumo. That they do not find sumo difficult means that while sekitori continue generation after generation, it is difficult for even one referee to emerge. The parable of the fine horse and Bole appears in ancient texts. While horses that can travel a thousand li always exist, Bole does not always exist. He takes horses born in the wild and properly trains them into fine horses that become useful to high-ranking officials and nobles. This is Bole's virtue. Referees too, regarding sumo's rules, regulations, and also...

One: In February, Genroku 16, year of the Sheep, from Korea, Lord Sō Tsushima-no-kami made his first entry into the country for auspicious ceremonies, and also for condolences regarding his kinsman Lord Gyōbu-no-dayū. The interpreter-envoys and their attendants numbered: twenty-eight high-ranking officials, fifty-four middle-ranking officials, twenty-four low-ranking officials, totaling 108 people of all ranks. The security guides were two retainers of Lord Tsushima-no-kami and two sailors. Boarding one ship on the morning of February 5th, they departed from that country with favorable winds, but suddenly encountered severe weather in the open sea. They barely managed to approach within four or five ri of Tsushima, but due to strong winds and waves, they could not make landfall and drowned. The matter of the interpreters' sea crossing had been known beforehand.

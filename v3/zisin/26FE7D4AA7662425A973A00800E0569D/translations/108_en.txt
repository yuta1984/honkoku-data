Understanding the Principles of Wrestling Techniques
When facing an opponent and standing, the mental energy is like holding back flowing water or releasing a bowstring. When one endures this meaning and becomes single-minded in resolve, having one thing in its proper place, the technique becomes sharp like wielding a white blade - this is all because the mental energy is cultivated.

In general, all techniques are what the mind produces, so when referees observe matches, it is not with the eyes, but they know that the mind communicates with the hands and feet. Therefore, the mind arises faster than form. Thus seeing is slow, knowing is fast. This is the first transmission.

For example, when the body follows proper rules, it does not bend even a hair's width. Though each person has their specialty, when well-balanced, it is like a master's skillful flower arrangement. Also, putting one's hand under the opponent's armpit is called sashi-te (inserting hand). Also, placing one arm against one's belly and gently pressing the opponent's elbow - when inserting on the left, it's called left-sashi, and the right is called suke-te (assisting hand). Also, for feet there are sashi-ashi (inserting foot) and suke-ashi (assisting foot). In general, both sashi-te and suke-te involve keeping the wrist flexible while putting strength into the thumb and upper arm.

Though these meanings are numerous, they all tend toward one's specialty. Understanding victory and defeat means having a target in one's belly, and the wrestler knows defeat and knows victory. That target is the subtle art of training, so when training is neglected, there is no target. The yotsu-mi (four-point stance) for hands and feet is as previously described. Putting strength into the upper arm's elbow and drawing in the assisting foot to execute a割り付け (splitting attack). The opponent bends while I remain straight, so without extending the hand, one turns and grasps. This is a renowned technique with much meaning.

To compare this to things: rather than moving and disturbing the mind, why not remain still and govern the mind? Also, when facing something one should not do, rather than acting and violating righteousness, would it not be better to refrain and still conform to the Way? Here one should quiet the mind and know for oneself. Also, even if small in build, equal to the large in build, appearing gentle yet robust - this is called proper seasoning.

In general, when understanding this meaning and observing, a person's bearing in serious combat becomes clear. Regarding the forms of techniques and grappling forms, binding them in writing does not convey their meaning. Even when written down, one cannot form adequate words. This place is where all earnest people should achieve self-understanding. In yotsu-mi, grasping the upper belt and the same upper foot...

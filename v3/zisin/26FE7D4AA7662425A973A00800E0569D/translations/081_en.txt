As stated above, this appeared in the official notice of the first month, twenty-eighth day of this spring (the third year of Bunsei, year of the tiger). Lord Wakizaka previously [the third year of Bunsei was actually the year of the dragon]
during the Korean embassy mission, received orders to provide careful attention due to the Sō family's first year, and was already supposed to be stationed in Tsushima in the eighth year of Bunka, year of the sheep. However, after his retirement from the position of magistrate of temples and shrines, he was also relieved of these duties, though this was entirely rumor, and this time it appears to be an official release from duty.

One: During the Kanpō era, when His Excellency Aritoku-in made a progress along the Sumida River, he entered Bokuboji Temple
and viewed the ancient site of Umewaka. After returning to the palace, he inquired of Hayashi Daigaku about the true story of Umewaka,
but there was no clear evidence to report. Since Denpōin, the head priest of Asakusa Kannon, was an ancient temple, he inquired whether there might be written records preserved there. Denpōin
submitted a written report. In ancient times, until the reign of His Excellency Taitoku-in, the present Asakusa Gate had
not yet been erected. At that time, present-day Bakurō-chō was inhabited by masterless samurai horse riders and other horse dealers.
Among these horse dealers was one called Narihira. His family name is not known in detail. This Narihira

was exceptionally strong, able to freely handle large stones that would require seven or eight other men to carry.
Narihira, proud of his strength, would go out to wrestle whenever sumo matches were announced anywhere. Around this time, there was also a sumo wrestler called Umewaka near Asakusa Kannon, who had defeated
the champion wrestlers in benefit sumo matches.
Umewaka was said to be skilled at wrestling. When Narihira heard about this, there was a benefit wrestling match near present-day Narihira
Tenjin in Honjō, and Umewaka was also to appear. Upon hearing this, Narihira immediately went to that sumo ring
and challenged Umewaka to a match. Although Umewaka did not have particularly great strength,
he was mysteriously skillful. Being unskilled but strong, Narihira intended to grab Umewaka
in one hold and waited for his chance. The referee raised his fan again, and just as they seemed about to grapple, Narihira
extended both hands to grab Umewaka, lifted him high, circled the earthen embankment three times, and slammed Umewaka
to the ground. Somehow, Umewaka quickly stood up, spread both arms and called out "Ya!" 
Narihira was immediately thrown backwards and knocked down. This was because Umewaka, being skillful, when thrown by Narihira

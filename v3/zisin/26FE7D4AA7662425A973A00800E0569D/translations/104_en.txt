The meaning is the single move of the heart.

The Form of Surplus Strength
When using strength, there is surplus; when not using it, there is insufficiency. Simply know the proper degree and understand appropriately, with a heart that uses hard things softly. When applying strength to strength, there is necessarily surplus.

The Form of Excess and Insufficiency
For example, even if an opponent is inferior to oneself, one should not force a victory. When one's spirit becomes singular, it is dangerous - even a single word of anger is the principle of things.

Thus "one body, one life, one twist" - this is called "the three implements complete." Among those who enter this way, few reach proper form within ten years. In the poem by the monk Saigyō:

The belly. Not in emptiness, but even in my heart, the moon at dawn laughs - shall we tie the conclusion? Snail.

Jōson says: This "snail" refers to the referee Kimura Shōnosuke in retirement, living in Negishi, who was acquainted with a haikai poet called Gibaku, and his haikai was better than usual. He was said to be a disciple of Settarō Sansagi, and I too once joined the Rōō-sō gathering where we sat knee to knee. He was particularly an old man who made worldly conversations interesting. Rōō-sō was the shop name of Gibaku, located near Nezu Gongen shrine, around the villa of Lord Miura.

Shokusanjin's One Hundred Poems - Spring

At the beginning of the new year, the New Year's blessing plant - the character for "wealth" is found within it

Seeing the drunken courtier, spring has come crosswise through the great road

Looking out, Ōhashi Bridge is hazy at Manabe Wharf - first the boats setting sail with starboard helm

Spring haze rises wearily, stretching the sun's legs across the entire Musashino plain

Neither compassion nor the three treasures of Buddhism can match the single voice of "hō-hokekyo"

At Koshi no hi in the fields, Minister Komatsu is still cited as an example of a wise man

The color of blue paper pasted on the edge of the cutting board - what can compare to young greens?

Seeing me scatter poems again, even thinking what the plum blossoms might think is embarrassing

With the literature-loving tree on the right and the gifted plum on the left - how august is this reign

Calculating one-tenth at a thousand gold each, sixty thousand ryō at spring's dawn

On the Sumida River, the morning after, the wild geese return in the shape shown in guidebooks

Whatever it may be, these buds in spring rain, the sleeves of the new courtesans and their lingering customers

The green willow has eyes, nose, eyebrows, hair, and waist, but lacking a front is its regret

Here and there with joints, like Kōshū silk thread in raw reading - such is the green willow

○Same year, 12th month: Notification to Lord Sakai Hyūga-no-kami
　Regarding Kawachi-no-kami's recent house confinement, he inquired whether he should come to the capital and show restraint, but there was no
　need for such ceremony. His confinement in his own castle was considered improper conduct. Moreover, his usual behavior has been poor, and additionally his retainers' and domain

○Same year, 9th month: Ichimasa, son of Lord Wakisaka Nakatsukasa-shōyū, was placed under the custody of Lord Sakai Yuge-no-suke. This was because Ichimasa, son of Nakatsukasa-

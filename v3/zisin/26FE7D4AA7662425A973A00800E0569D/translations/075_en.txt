One: 1,200 ryō - expenses for all courtesans in Yoshiwara on the night of the seventh day of the sixth month. Total: 2,400 ryō, it is said.

Jōson's note: Due to this Takao affair, Lord Sakakibara was transferred from Harima Province Himeji to Echigo Takada, it is said. How this story was passed down is unclear, but in the house of Kosuge Sanai, the village headman (ōkimoiri) of Jisha Village in Kambara District, Echigo Province, there is an inkstone box said to have been sent by Lord Sakakibara to Takao. It is made of solid ground with gold nashiji lacquer, featuring the Genji cart mon in raised maki-e with bush clover decoration. When I stayed at Sanai's house during my village inspection rounds, I saw it myself, and it did not appear to be an ordinary item.

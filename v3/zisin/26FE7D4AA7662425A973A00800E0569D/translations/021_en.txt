The same Yosaburo and his brother Kyubei's residence was attacked. Hansuke, Kyubei, and eight retainers were killed and taken away, whereupon Yosaburo and fellow retainers Tarobei and Gozaemon (three men) pursued them to Ushigome Dobashi, where all three also died in battle. Genpachi's group uniformly wore white haori jackets and white headbands, lit torches, broke down the gate, and forced their way in. One retainer on Genpachi's side was also killed. On the 22nd of the same month, the aforementioned three men and six retainers appeared before Lord Ii Kambu-no-kami, stating regarding the investigation: "We were residing in a distant place, did not know of your inquiry, and did not come immediately," requesting postponement and saying "please order us however you see fit." When Kambu-no-kami conveyed this, he said: "This was an extremely serious matter in the castle town, considered improper conduct, and should be severely punished, but since you have come to Kambu-no-kami's residence, your lives are spared and you are ordered exiled to Oshima." Within the same household, Genpachi's father Kuranosuke quarreled with Yosaburo and was about to draw his sword when someone intervened and they returned to their lodgings. Kuranosuke committed seppuku and ordered Yosaburo to do the same, but Yosaburo refused to commit seppuku and departed, so Genpachi and others left the household. Such was the situation.

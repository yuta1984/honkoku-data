They do not know themselves. This is entirely because their technique has not reached sufficient level. One should simply practice diligently without neglecting even a single day, reflect upon oneself to seek out deficiencies, accumulate merit, and naturally develop mysterious techniques by first knowing that one's own weaknesses come before those of the opponent. Knowing oneself, one corrects those weaknesses and exercises self-restraint. Good and evil do not come from others but all reside within oneself.

Now, as sumo techniques improve, one's name resounds throughout the three capitals, and it becomes an art performed even before high-ranking officials and nobles. Originally emerging from remote places, relying on strength and large physique to enter this way, when one gradually reaches maturity, it might be said to be like a lotus flower blooming from mud. At such times, one should focus solely on polishing the heart. If appearance and heart are not in balance, in true combat it becomes transparent and shameful. One should polish that single thing within the belly to be as clear as crystal, and when wearing a sword as a warrior's conduct, when called a person of character, the foremost concern should be maintaining the dignity to bestow benevolence upon those below.

Now, because that single thing in one's belly cannot be seen, one does not know one's own shame. When it comes to real combat, people clearly perceive this. For example, when facing an opponent inferior to oneself, the opponent may be good while oneself may be poor, yet this is appropriate - it does not mean holding back. The meaning is simply that it should be to that degree.

Hearing the traditions of the ancients, when wrestlers faced off and the referee raised his fan for the bout, there was no calling "wait." I heard this first occurred during a match between Hakkaku and Tanikaze in the Enkyō period. Moreover, what was called "concealing the scrotum" involved hanging the loincloth sash a full foot down. Now it is not lowered at all. Due to such things, proper form has been disrupted and shame is not recognized. Indeed, until around the An'ei period, wrestlers who competed without "wait" calls could occasionally be seen. Those who earnestly desired this understood it well.

Now there are skilled wrestlers but no true masters. People are all clever, and single-minded individuals are rare. This is not the fault of those individuals. Sadly, it is caused by the trends of the times.

When there are disputes over match outcomes, elders from east and west and three referees convene to weigh the mysterious techniques accumulated over many years. All three deliberate together and divide the judgment without the slightest favoritism. Therefore, in ancient law, where the balance of authority decides, it must emerge from the forty-eight techniques. Among these forty-eight techniques, they compete according to the names of various moves and divide the judgment into four-tenths, six-tenths, seven-tenths, three-tenths, and so forth. Also in the abbreviated transmission: "How appropriate indeed! Truly the magnificent spectacle of an enlightened age - in this it reaches its peak." The words are truly without favoritism, clear and beautiful.

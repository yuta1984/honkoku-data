[should report] to the senior councilors and receive instructions. When arrangements are made, a letter should be obtained from their lord, and permission granted with their personal written oath.

Regarding the above matters concerning palanquins, it goes without saying, but even for kago (simple palanquins), one must report to the metsuke (inspectors), and if there are unavoidable circumstances, instructions will be given after investigation. Enpō 9 (Year of the Rooster), 5th month, 28th day

○ In the same year, their domains were confiscated: Son Kagatsume Tosa-no-kami was placed under the custody of Lord Ishikawa Wakasa-no-kami
Father Kagatsume Kai-no-kami was placed under the custody of Lord Matsudaira Tosa-no-kami

This concerned the investigation of a boundary dispute over the fief of Lord Naruse Kichizaemon. When Lord Kai-no-kami received his granted land, there were careless procedures, and documents submitted by Lord Tosa-no-kami contained contradictions. Since Lord Kai-no-kami had previously served as a magistrate and should have known better, this was deemed improper conduct. (Lord Uesugi Danjō-daihitsu was also placed under custody) Lord Ina Saemon

In this case of the field boundary dispute between Lord Kagatsume Tosa-no-kami and Lord Naruse Kichizaemon, the matter of village registers became a subject of dispute. When Lord Kagatsume Kai-no-kami received his domain, he should have obtained proper documentation, but his careless procedures were deemed improper. Although severe punishment should have been imposed, mercy was shown and he was placed under custody.

○ In the same year, the townsman Ishikawa Rokudayū of Funamachi, along with his wife and three children, were banished, and their properties at both locations were confiscated.

1. Enpō 9 (Year of the Rooster) - era name changed to Tenna 1. Regarding the Echigo house disturbance: Details can be found in various family records. After thorough investigation, on the 21st day of the 6th month, the Shogun rendered direct judgment. In the great hall, the Three Branch Houses, various daimyo, hereditary retainers, and officials were in attendance. To the front hanging veranda: Oguri Mimasaku

Oguri Mimasaku and his son committed seppuku. Ogita and Nagami, among others, were placed under custody for exile to remote islands. Nagami Ōkura

At the time of this direct judgment, according to ancient precedent, disputes and confrontations between houses were heard from behind the jade curtain, but since these individuals were related to the Shogun's family, the jade curtain was not hung.

I humbly write to inform you: Regarding Matsudaira Echigo-no-kami, his poor governance and the disturbance within his household are deemed improper. Therefore, he is placed under your custody. For the journey, Lord Kyōgoku Bitchū-no-kami has been appointed to escort him. Please understand this matter accordingly. With utmost respect and humility.

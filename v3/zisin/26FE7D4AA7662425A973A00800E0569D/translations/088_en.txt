It was ordered thus. Truly, as an unprecedented event, none of the people who heard this story were unmoved. That it was celebrated throughout the world as the "Genroku Soga" was indeed a magnificent tale.

According to Jōson's commentary, this vendetta is what people celebrate as told by Ishii Meidōshi, or what is titled "Genroku Soga" as in the main text, but this differs slightly from what is commonly circulated and is written in a simplified manner, so I record it here and conclude. What I find questionable is that the brothers Hanzō and Genzō, after enduring countless hardships to carry out their revenge, did not report to their lord Itakura but instead secretly went up to Osaka to erase their names from the official records. Had they reported to Lord Itakura, their achievement would have been rewarded and Lord Aoyama would have given them special treatment. That Lord Itakura spent time investigating the pursuers who had unexpectedly escaped was probably because he appreciated their achievement. Also, while it is said that Lord Aoyama granted stipends to the brothers, it is doubtful that he had their residences strictly enclosed and guards assigned to them. Therefore, the truth of these events is not certain even in this document.

One thing that is truly detestable in this world must be wind against flowers and clouds over the moon. When flowers bloom, mountain winds are fierce; when the moon is clear in autumn, clusters of clouds habitually drift by - how truly vexing this is. That one would seek shelter in the shade of flowers even when wet is indeed natural. On an evening waiting for the moon to rise, sitting on the veranda tuning string and wind instruments, or leaning against a desk and looking up, before one knows it, clouds appear in clusters. How very troublesome! Moreover, having traveled countless miles setting sail by the seaside, poling along riverbanks, crossing mountain paths and dividing through fields, then turning back to wait, only to have the usual clouds spread across the sky - how extremely frustrating! Thinking whether to spend this renowned moonlit night alone, calling out to companions, sweeping away the mugwort in the garden and arrowroot leaves from the eaves, yet before anyone else, the sound of a sudden shower - how truly hateful! Soon taking up sake cups and making merry, but when even wind joins in and the sound of pattering against the dwelling begins, in the eighth month...

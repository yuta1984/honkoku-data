Same year: Lord Mizuno Shinano-no-kami went mad, killed his wife, killed one servant, and committed suicide himself. (This wife was the daughter of Lord Mizuno Kenmotsu.)

1. Kanbun 8 (1668), 1st month: Great fire in Edo, and Ryōgoku Bridge burned down.

Same year: Tsurugaoka Hachimangū Shrine in Kamakura was relocated/reconstructed.

Same year, 3rd month: An edict was issued stating that aside from rapeseed, items such as coral and pearls, and other living creatures that are useless should not be traded, and also silk, pongee, brocade, cotton, cloth, hemp, copper, lacquer, and oil should not be traded.

1. Kanbun 8: Due to poor administration of retainers within Lord Takaryoku Sakon Dayū's domain, his domain was confiscated and he was placed under the custody of Lord Matsudaira Kamechidayo. The eldest son, Iyo-no-kami, was placed under the custody of Sakai Saemon-no-jō, and the second son, Uemon, was placed under the custody of Sanada Izu-no-kami. The administration of Shimabara domain in Hizen was poor, imposing unreasonable duties and causing hardship to the farmers. The local people and coastal residents complained to the provincial inspectors, and upon investigation, this was found to be undeniably true, and reports were made accordingly. Shimabara had once become a devastated area, but farmers were gathered from various places to settle there. The deceased father Settsu-no-kami was appointed to this task, and rice and money were provided by the government for reconstruction. However, the situation became deplorable. Moreover, the administration of retainers was poor, causing suffering to the common people, while he himself lived extravagantly - matters deemed extremely improper. Therefore, his domain was confiscated and custody was ordered.

Same year, 2nd month, dismissal: Fukutomi Heizaemon and Kusakabe Gorōhachi. Both men's administration of their fiefs was poor, and complaints were made to the provincial inspectors. After deliberation, the above punishment was ordered.

Same year, 8th month: Lord Okudera Daizen Dayū had 20,000 koku out of his 100,000 koku assessed value confiscated and was ordered to transfer to Yamagata in Ushū Province. The reason given was as follows:
Regarding Daizen Dayū: when his father Mimasaka-no-kami died, his retainers committed junshi (following their lord in death). The prohibition against this practice was issued in previous years, but this occurrence was deemed improper. Strict punishment should have been imposed, but considering his generations of loyal service and that Mimasaka-no-kami had been appointed as attendant to Lord Taiyūin during his youth, clemency was granted and the above punishment was imposed instead.

1. Kanbun 10 (1670): Lord Kagatsume Kai-no-kami was ordered into house confinement. This was because recently many legal matters had accumulated, requiring various magistrates to appear at the council chamber even on non-scheduled days, which was deemed troublesome. Imperial messengers delivered sweets as a gesture.

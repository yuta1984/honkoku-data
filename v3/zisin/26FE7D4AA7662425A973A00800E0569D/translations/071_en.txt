...it would not be proper to leave it undocumented, so I have recorded it.

1. On the second day of the first month of Kanbun 5 (1665), year of the Snake, after a thunderstorm in Osaka, at the Hour of the Dog, lightning fire blazed up from the north side of the castle keep and it burned down. The officials of the castle at that time were as follows:
Castle Steward: Aoyama Inaba-no-kami Munetoshi
Castle Guards: Kyōbashi Gate - Itakura Naizen-no-shō Shigenori; Tamatsukuri Gate - Watanabe Etchū-no-kami Yoshitsuna
Additional Guards: Doi Shinano-no-kami Toshinao, Sengoku Echizen-no-kami Masaaki, Matsudaira Sado-no-kami Yoshinao, Endō Bizen-no-kami Tsunetomo
Guard Commanders: Matsudaira Buzen-no-kami Katsushige, Okabe Tamba-no-kami Nagasuke

On this night, Sakakibara Gen'bei from Buzen-no-kami's unit and Takeuchi Saburōbei from Tamba-no-kami's unit climbed up to the third level while the castle keep was blazing and safely retrieved the written orders and horse identification tags. Although both had their hair singed short, they immediately departed as express messengers to report to Edo. They were promptly summoned before His Lordship and, as a reward, both received salary increases by His Lordship's decree.

During your suspension, you submitted reports claiming that Hanzaemon was performing official duties - this is entirely disgraceful conduct. Originally, the recent misconduct where your retainers conspired in improper behavior was also due to your poor management. Regarding the deferment of borrowed funds repayment, you made shameless appeals, and with your consistently loose conduct, when your retainers committed offenses requiring punishment, you attempted to cover things up - such reports have reached us. Though this is misconduct, considering your family lineage, there were some considerations for clemency. However, you left Hanzaemon's absconding matter unattended for a long time, only submitting a report this past New Year, and apparently only then consulting with relatives for the first time. Since Hanzaemon is related by adoption and blood, you should have been even more thorough...

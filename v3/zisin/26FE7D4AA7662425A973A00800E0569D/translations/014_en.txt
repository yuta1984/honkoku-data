Same year, 12th month: A letter from the wife of Uesugi Kunai, who was serving as an imperial envoy to Kyoto, was lost either in Kyoto or on the road. When she arrived in Edo, she was so distressed that she sent people to investigate at the lodgings along the route, but when nothing was found, she committed suicide.

Same year: The warship Ataka-maru was ordered and completed, so the shogun went out on the Tenchi-maru and Dairyū-maru for an inspection. There was a 1,000 koku stipend increase for Lord Mukai Shōgen, fifty sailors, and gifts for the repair magistrates.

Same year, 4th month: Great flood at Nikkō. The hut of Inspector Tanaka Sanzaemon was swept away, and Sanzaemon drowned. Six people from Wakadō and four servants died. The Inari River overflowed, sweeping away townhouses and killing approximately 140 people.
The aforementioned Tanaka Sanzaemon was the younger brother of Kyōgoku Anchi.

Same year, 4th month: Naitō Rokuzaemon of the Great Guard had been confined for madness about ten years earlier, but his eldest son Heijūrō went mad again this time. On the night of the 11th of the same month, he killed two of his younger brothers, rushed out the gate, cut down one street guard, returned home and chased around the servants. His father Rokuzaemon rushed out and the two fought each other with swords, cutting down two or three male servants, and father and son set fire to the house. Rokuzaemon committed suicide, and Heijūrō was killed by relatives who gathered together and speared him. Rokuzaemon's two sons had been serving the two ministers, but both were dismissed from service due to their madness.

Same year, 7th month: Lord Kishū presented a crane substitute as tribute. It was slightly larger than a blue heron, with white stripes running through the feathers on both sides of its head, red eyes, a short beak, and otherwise resembled a true crane. Lord Inaba Mino-no-kami observed it and said it was called "aneha-zuru."

Same year, year-end: Regarding the kosode robes presented for year-end tribute, four lords - Rokugō Iga-no-kami, Shimazu Tajima-no-kami, Koide Ōsumi-no-kami, and Honda Saihē - presented them on the 22nd, but the kosode attendants refused to accept them and returned them, saying the cotton padding was thin and poorly made. Lord Matsudaira Bizen-no-kami was on duty and when he heard about this, he said, "The chief retainers and castle attendants will be troubled, so have the temple priests who handle such matters exchange them for proper ones," and thus they were accepted.

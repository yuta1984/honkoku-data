In the autumn of Tenmei 6 (1786), the year of hinoe-uma, during the Kantō floods, his administrative capabilities were praised and he was appointed Settsu-no-kami. Thereafter, he was called Hanzaemon-sama throughout the district, and later became Hanzaemon-no-jō, then Ukon-no-shōgen. He was praised by all society, but due to the aforementioned circumstances, he later entered Mount Kōya, as I have roughly heard.

One: In the villages of the three districts of Hashun, Kashima, and Fūgyoku in Kii Province, from around last August, mice appeared in great numbers, damaging rice fields and dry fields, and eating the roots of grasses and trees in the fields and mountains. Initially, mice appeared from the mountains of a place called Namo Village in Fūgyoku District, eating and destroying the roots of miscanthus and such. Whether they came up from the sea, emerged from the soil, or were some transformation into mice is unknown. From this point, the mice gradually increased in great numbers, affecting 390 villages and eating the crops in the fields. Although they tried hunting drives, burning mouse holes with fire, or placing bait in pitfall traps, they could catch only a few. When they flooded the fields, the mice also got water and

showed no signs of weakening. They watched to see if the mice might decrease when snow fell, but even when spring came, they did not decrease. During this time, mice also appeared in people's homes, coming out at night or during quiet times to eat the crops in the fields.

One: Of the cattle and horses owned by farmers in Kawachi Village in Noto Province, ten animals developed wounds from their backs to their necks starting from late January of this year and died. Since many mice appeared in the stables, it is thought they may have died due to the mice.

One: The mice have shorter tails than ordinary mice, are smaller, and have pointed snouts. Their color is the same as usual. There are also red-colored and dead-leaf-colored ones. The mice come in various sizes. This was reported on the eighteenth day of the second month. The increase or decrease of mice thereafter is unknown.

One: Sakai Magistrate Mizutani Shinano-no-kami's administrative methods are particularly excellent and are praised. When he visited Sakai, he provided a meal for the local yoriki officials, consisting of soup, vinegared dishes, grilled food, red sardines, and pickles. When Shinano-no-kami visited and spoke to everyone, he said, "Today I have provided this meal. From above as well..."

[Marginal notes]
Norimura's note: These district names do not exist in Kii Province and appear to be errors in copying names from another province. However, the name Kashima exists only as a district name in Hitachi Province, and district names like Hashun and Fūgyoku do not exist at all. Therefore, these appear to be copying errors. Also, the time period is unclear.

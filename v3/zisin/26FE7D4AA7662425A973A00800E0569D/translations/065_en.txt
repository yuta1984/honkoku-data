There was no legitimate birth. A son was born to a concubine, who is the current Kazuma. My late father Shichirō Dayū Jakusui's deceased mother was O-Gen (Ken) Bōkan, daughter of Seki Jidayū from the retainers of Lord Honda Shimotsuke-no-kami, lord of Shirakawa Castle. Jidayū's son, bearing the same name, advanced to the rank of bugyō (magistrate) and received a stipend of two hundred koku, but the remaining three died young. When the Honda family left Utsunomiya, Shichirō Dayū requested leave and sought various positions in the Edo area, but was unsuccessful. He remained a rōnin for life, later returning to Sukagawa where he died of illness at seventy-four. His memorial tablet is at Chōkō-ji temple in Sanjōme, bearing the posthumous name Kōzan Jakusui Koji. His mother died of illness at the residence of Tagawa Shōbē in Miharu and was called Shinni Bōkan Daishi.

Before Lord Nakahata Kōzuke-no-suke, there are stone monuments, as well as a stone monument for Jakusui's deceased elder brother Genbē, located in the mountains on the north side of Sanjōme village. At Honpō-ji temple, Jakusui's memorial tablet was erected at that time. At Chōkō-ji temple, there is said to be the memorial tablet of the castle lord Kōzuke-no-suke, along with various documents, called Chōkō-ji-dono Ippō Zenshin Koji.

Now, when Kanro Jimon Nichijō was also residing in Sanjōme, he went to Mito, taking Kazuma with him to the Mito residence in Koishikawa. At that time, Zuirin-ji temple in Yanaka village was a branch temple of Mount Minobu, where the venerable Daichū-in Nichikō resided, and I entered to study there. Among the temple patrons, when the young lord of Miharu, Akita Izu-no-kami, visited Zuirin-ji temple, during an elegant tea ceremony where Elder Yamada Seiki was in attendance, I served sake. Seiki remarked, "This young man is said to be the younger brother of Hashimoto Shōzaemon from the castle town." Izu-no-kami replied, "I am a younger son living at home. Among my relatives, I should recommend him to Lord Matsudaira Tōtōmi-no-kami, so I will ask Seiki to discuss this privately." Therefore, he immediately went to the Tsukiji residence to make the request, and Elder Seiki also privately asked the chief retainer Ōkubo Buzaemon. I was quickly summoned and became an inner page with ten ryō and rations for five men, four sets of official clothing, and meal allowances for the first, fifteenth, and twenty-eighth days of each month and special occasions.

Lord Tōtōmi held the fourth court rank and had connections to the Divine Sovereign (Tokugawa Ieyasu). Among the hereditary daimyo, Lord Tōtōmi-no-kami sat on the left and Lord Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami on the right, both being distinguished lords. I accompanied him to his castle town of Iiyama in Shinano Province and served faithfully year-round. However, I fell ill and took leave, staying for three years as a dependent at the Hongō Maruyama retirement residence of Hosokawa Rokurō Uemon, a retired yoriki from my lord's group and a distant relative.

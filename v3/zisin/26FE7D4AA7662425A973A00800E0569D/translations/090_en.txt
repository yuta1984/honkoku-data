This was indeed a moment of refined taste. The people had been gazing only at this sky waiting, but when the first wild geese cried as they flew across, even the unrefined boatmen said "We have encountered a perfect season." Even the sky's color, darker than indigo, had grown completely dark, and at the moment when the patterns of the waves could no longer be distinguished, the faintly rising moon's reflection was still not clear. When the treetops became discernible, the light increased even more, creating an indescribably beautiful scene as if flowers from the moon's cassia tree had scattered across the water's surface. The dew lay across the river surface and light filled the sky - exchanging such interesting observations, we took up our cups and shared in the excitement.

Alone, Lord Naminohizuki gazed at the moon and said, "Long ago when I set out on a boat to a lake in Oku Province and spent a night in revelry - how many years have passed since then? Alas, all those companions have died, and now only the old man Chazan remains in this world," lamenting deeply. Moved by the occasion, adapting the verse "二千里外故人心" (A friend's heart beyond two thousand ri) into Japanese poetry, people recited Chinese poems. The children of Lord Katei were also present, and since Tsubo-no-seki from Aizu was there as well, we joined our sleeves like Hui-lian and Kang-le of Tang.

Since it would be uninteresting to be the only one subject to the wine penalty game of Jin Valley, I labored to compose and obtained the character "sato" (village).

"If you ask one familiar with this place: when did you first begin to hear the wild geese of this riverside village?"
"At this very moment, they sound even more clear - the voices of wild geese in the moon-waiting sky"
"Crossing the Sumida River and Ayase, stopping the boat to watch the moon emerge from the pines"
"Setting out on boat to the Sumida riverbank in the moon's midnight, knowing the full extent of autumn's pathos"

Intending to pursue pleasure to its limit, we raised the anchor rope and entrusted ourselves to the ebbing tide. I recalled what a child once said: "Do the pine trees know if even mountains travel?"

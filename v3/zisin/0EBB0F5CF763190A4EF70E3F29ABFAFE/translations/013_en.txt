Earthquakes are not caused by the battle of yin-yang or water and fire moving the country, but are merely movements of the earth. Also, according to the principle of "earth generates metal" (from Five Elements theory), metals are also moved and circulated along with it. As the common saying goes, "after rain, the ground hardens," earthquakes also subside and the world becomes peaceful. Increasingly, the five grains have abundant harvests, the common people prosper, and they sing and dance "Long Live the Reign."

The realm is settled as an unshakeable land
Where prosperity circulates through the blessed soil

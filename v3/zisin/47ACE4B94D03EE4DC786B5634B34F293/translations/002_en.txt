The damage in the Kamigata region (Kansai area) has been severe, with ships delayed due to repairs and other matters taking an extraordinary amount of time. The situation with alternative ships in Osaka is similarly problematic. Consequently, of the Hyuga Province ships allocated for our transportation, two vessels have been urgently commanded by the resident officials to carry large military cargo via Kagoshima.

Due to this great confusion and unexpected circumstances, I am particularly worried that errors might occur with the promised white charcoal shipment, which would be inexcusable.

I am making every effort to arrange matters, and three ships have already departed from Akae and should arrive in Saga promptly. I will also arrange for three more ships to depart from Akae between the end of this month and the beginning of next month. This morning, the accounting office in Takaoka informed me that the quantity will exceed what we discussed last winter by about 2,400-2,500 bales.

With these shipping arrangements, Chōbei and others have also sent word that after witnessing the ships' departure from Akae, they plan to proceed to ports in Hizen Province. Therefore, I hope that you too will this time come to our locality...

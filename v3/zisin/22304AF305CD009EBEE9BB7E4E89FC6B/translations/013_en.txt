Earthquakes are not caused by battles between yin-yang or water-fire that shake the country, but are merely movements of the earth. Also, according to the principle of "earth generates metal" (from Five Elements theory), metal also moves and circulates along with it. As the common saying goes, "after rain, the ground hardens," so too earthquakes will subside and the world will be restored. Increasingly, the five grains will have abundant harvests, the common people will prosper, and we shall sing "Long Live the Reign of Ten Thousand Years."

Under heaven, settled as an unshakeable land,
The copper-rich earth circulates prosperity.

Such sliding down of earth from storehouses was numerous, and houses leaned with warning signs posted saying "Take care" visible here and there on the streets. On the fourteenth day, around midnight it was quite strong, and at the seventh hour there was again rumbling and tremors. This day was the peak of the seasonal collection period, yet the debt collectors seemed more melancholy than usual - what could this mean? On the fifteenth day, a little rain began to fall, and even amidst this there was again rumbling that continued intermittently without cease. People had already grown accustomed to the earthquakes and might treat them as someone else's affair, but their hearts were certainly not so, and they must have prayed. On the sixteenth day the rain continued, and from this great disaster roof tiles had slid off. Carpenters, tile masters, plasterers, assistants and others - with so many places needing repair, they could not manage to get around to everything, and rain was leaking in many places, creating much hardship. Also, houses built beside storehouses feared the earth sliding down and worried excessively, with many people going to stay elsewhere night after night. On the seventeenth day, the rain was still falling heavily, there was a brief clearing at the eighth hour, and after sunset there was a little lightning in the west.

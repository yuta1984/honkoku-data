Now, all the old houses and old storehouses collapsed, and in addition, shrines and temples, stone torii gates, stone lanterns, or earthwork walls and high fences fell down in great numbers. Even sturdy storehouses without exception developed cracks. Various utensils on shelves fell and were damaged, cooking stoves collapsed, and needless to say, sliding doors, doors, and shoji screens were affected.

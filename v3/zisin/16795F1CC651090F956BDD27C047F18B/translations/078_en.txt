1. Regarding the earthquake and fire, [we investigated] temples providing rice and money as charitable aid to shop houses in front of temple gates, neighboring towns, and other areas, or temples forgiving land rent for the time being and not collecting it.

[We investigated] the amount of the aforementioned rice and money, as well as the number of people who received charitable aid both in front and behind the temple gates, dates, and three other items. We conducted a thorough investigation limited to our neighborhood association, and found that there were no persons who received charitable aid from temples as described above. We hereby respectfully report this. That is all.

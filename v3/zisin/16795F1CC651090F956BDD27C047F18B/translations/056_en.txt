1. Shibaichō monthly administrator Bōkichi reports that due to the earthquake on the night of the 2nd of this month, when residences and storehouses were completely collapsed by the tremors and people suffered hardships from fires, Lord Matsudaira Mutsu-no-kami bestowed 100 hyō of unpolished rice to the 137-ken section on the west side of the town district, and additionally gave 100 hiki of money each to two of his retainers. This is reported as a petition.
The above report comes from Bōkichi's five-person group member Heihachi and town headman Hachirōemon.

Regarding temples providing rice and money as charity to gate-front townhouses, neighboring towns, and other areas due to the earthquake and fires, or temples that forgave rent and other payments for the time being without collecting them, as well as whether there were cases of samurai families providing rice and money as charity to nearby towns - we received official orders to investigate and report on these matters. After investigating within our group's jurisdiction, we found that there were no recipients of charity from either temples or samurai families. Therefore, we report this matter. Above.

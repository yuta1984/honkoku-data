Since it was announced that retainers of ten thousand koku or less may possess town-style merchant residences according to their means for military preparedness purposes, they have reported to the residence inspection office and possess them under their direct names. Among those who provided relief to tenants and shop renters on these properties, there were many prominent individuals. Previously, it is heard that they were commended using these names. There appear to be no precedents for praising samurai retainers.

Regarding this matter, concerning samurai retainers: "While licensed merchants and such should be summoned to our office and praised, even those who performed small acts of charity are being handled in this manner."

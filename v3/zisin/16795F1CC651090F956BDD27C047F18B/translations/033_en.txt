they will clearly demonstrate commendable acts and further carry out benevolent relief efforts, which may serve as assistance in rescuing the poor people of the city during times of natural disasters. If this is deemed appropriate, we shall prepare a proposal for submission and present it for your review. Therefore, we first respectfully inquire about this matter.

Regarding the implementation of the main text, if even small amounts are to be reported upward or official notices are issued, it will only cause confusion. Therefore, we respectfully suggest that amounts of fifty ryō or more should be handled according to the main text, and for amounts of one hundred ryō or more, they should be reported upward with silver coins granted as rewards, and that such arrangements be established as internal regulations.

The above.

Kansei 1, Year of the Rooster, Second Month, 21st Day
　　　　　　　　　　Makino Ōsumi-no-kami
Regarding all matters handled at one's own discretion: when retainers of samurai houses are summoned for questioning or confrontation and show carelessness in their conduct, but the matter is not serious enough to require formal inquiry, may severe reprimands be administered without the need for official inquiry?
　　Snake Year, Fifth Month

　　　The Oshikiri document was lost and could not be found. For retainers
　　　of samurai houses, official inquiry is not required. At the Council of
Notation　State, it was decided that severe reprimands are appropriate, 
　　　therefore up to severe reprimands should not require official inquiry.

For cases involving hōmen (released criminals) and below, except for matters requiring precedent consultation or items that must be reported, henceforth punishment may be administered without the need for prior inquiry. However, regarding cases of gambling within samurai residences and interrogation documents, even if investigations are not submitted, when the master's negligence is evident, or when cases involve changes in status or complex circumstances that require comparison with other cases, the previous procedures should be followed as before.
　Note: For cases involving ashigaru (foot soldiers) and below where punishment is administered without prior inquiry, notification documents must be submitted within the day or the following day.

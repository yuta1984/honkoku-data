　　　Preliminary Report on the Great Earthquake in Shinano Province
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Kawakami Kingosuke
On the 24th of this month, during clear weather both day and night when conditions were extremely calm, around 4 o'clock that same night there was a great earthquake. In Nakano-jō in Shinshū, the earthen walls of my administrative compound collapsed in various places due to the shaking. Additionally, in the villages near the compound headquarters, the weaker farmhouses had their auxiliary buildings collapse from the violent tremors that continued for some time before gradually subsiding. After that, with small intervals between each, continuous tremors occurred, and there were thunder-like sounds coming from the north of the compound through the night.

Within the villages of Minochi District under my jurisdiction, there are reportedly collapsed houses and injured people, though no formal reports have been submitted yet. From rumors I have been hearing, it appears that from Kawanakajima in the same province to Zenkōji temple, and from there southward to an area called Yamanaka, there was severe earthquake damage. In the Kawanakajima area, either entire villages of private homes or more than half have collapsed from the shaking, and furthermore fires broke out causing a great number of immediate deaths and injuries. Since this coincided with memorial services at Zenkōji temple, many travelers were staying along all the main roads, and there are reportedly many deaths. The Yamanaka area is remote and isolated so details are difficult to ascertain, but upstream on the Sai River

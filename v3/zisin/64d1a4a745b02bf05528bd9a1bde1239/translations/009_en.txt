[The earthquakes] could not be stopped, and on the same 29th day and the last day of the month, in the evening, there were tremors two or three times. While the situation in distant villages cannot be clearly understood, in the castle town and various districts there are still many more collapsed houses, and moreover, rocks have collapsed in great numbers from nearby mountaintops. Regarding the matter of the Sai River dam that was previously reported, in the area of Aniwa Village and Yamahira Village within Sarashina District, both ends of the half-face of the high mountain called Iwakura-yama collapsed - one location for about 30 chō, and one location for about 50 ken - pushing into the river, and there are village areas that have been buried and submerged in that vicinity. However, due to the large amount of rock, it appears that the water flow alone cannot wash it away. As a result, the water level may rise to seven or eight jō. Due to this, several locations have become submerged, and that area resembles a lake.

Of course, various measures have been ordered, but because of the large mountain and especially the rocks that have pushed in, these measures are insufficient. Moreover, the people of the Kawanakajima flatlands cannot predict where this dammed water will burst out, so they have fled in alarm to the mountain areas. The people of Tanba-jima post station are in the same situation, and they cannot manage the relay of people and horses. Although various measures have been ordered, we first report this matter. The above.

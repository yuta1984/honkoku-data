When I inquired about this, it was not so, and everyone said, "In this place, we have known about earthquakes from long ago. For that earthquake too, we knew the signs three days in advance and everyone prepared without entering the tunnels, so not one person was injured." When I asked how they knew these signs, they said, "Just before an earthquake is about to occur, earth vapors rise up in the tunnels, and people nearby cannot see each other from the waist up because everything becomes hazy and misty. We consider this a sign of earthquakes." Upon reflection, those who are constantly underground know earth vapors well, and birds in the sky know well the rising vapors. When this earthquake was about to occur, we saw several thousand herons take flight all at once.

Also, a certain person saw a rainbow appear in the northeast direction on the morning of the 27th day of the 6th month, before the sun had yet risen. Normally rainbows appear facing the sun. Should we not call all these unusual phenomena omens?

○ Regarding the Japanese name for earthquake, "naifuru," which I mentioned at the beginning, Master Kitaka says that according to the theory that "na is a fish," he obtained an ancient diagram and presents it here. This diagram appears at the beginning of a calendar, followed by a calendar for the 9th year of Kenkyū (year of the earth-horse, 355 days total). I have abbreviated this. It is said to be a printed scroll calendar that emerged from truly ancient Chinese paper at a temple in Matsuzaki village, Naka district, Izu province.

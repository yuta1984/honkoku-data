For about two or three days of this activity, no one slept inside their houses. Some moved to the precincts of large temples, others moved to riverbanks outside Rakuchū, and they gathered in the western fields to pass the nights. Even after three or four days had passed in this manner, there were still occasional small aftershocks remaining. At first there were as many as twenty tremors day and night, but they gradually subsided to about seven or eight times, sometimes becoming three or four times. However, even now that more than twenty days have already passed, the occasional small tremors still do not cease, and all the people remain confused and frightened.

There is a popular saying that "earthquakes are severe at the beginning, great winds are strong in the middle, and thunder is most violent at the end." Based on this, people understood that there would be no more great quakes like those at the beginning, but since women, children and such people still worry and are troubled, asking "how will it be?", and there are many who inquire about this, I record old accounts and cite examples of small quakes continuing after great quakes in order to put people's minds at ease, writing them below.

Regarding earthquakes that have occurred since ancient times, as far as can be seen in the national histories, they are listed in detail in the section on disasters and anomalies in volume 171 of the Ruijū Kokushi.

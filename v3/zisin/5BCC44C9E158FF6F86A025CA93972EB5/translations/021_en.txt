How could one possibly escape? The people's rumors are also extremely severe, saying that on that day and time the earthquake will be intense, also saying that such things bring curses, and also saying that on that day violent winds and rain will arrive together with earthquakes, compounded by warnings of bandits in the hinoe-uma year. People do not know where to settle themselves. Some abandon their work and duties, even going so far as to flee with their families to distant places.

Master Tōzan, growing older and ever more sincere in heart, pitied such circumstances and recorded these words to enlighten the people's hearts and dispel their confusion. Therefore, he did not embellish his language, nor did he strive for extensive research. The Master of Tōryōan received this, expanded upon it, arranged the words and disseminated them, requesting that I record their origins. It happened that someone explained to me the words of their ancestors.

Regarding those household implements, he said that people today do not fully understand their use and always consider them inconvenient, not knowing that when a great earthquake strikes, if one covers and shelters oneself with these, even though beams may break and walls may fall, one can preserve one's safety. Also, regarding today's lamp stands that hold candles, these too are all preparations for earthquakes. These were likely devised and installed as precautions following the great earthquake of the Hōreki era. After the fires of the Tenmei era, people no longer knew earthquakes were to be feared, and today's construction shows only preparations against fire. Without having personally experienced Hōreki, one's thinking does not extend that far, and thus the speed of human hearts' changes in allegiance is like this. Therefore, I record this as well, hoping that people will infer by analogy and pass this on for generations, always having something to learn from and something to prepare for.

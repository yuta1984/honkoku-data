So he hurriedly finished his meal, wrote down (his observations), and said "Take me first toward Saga." With his usual efficiency, they immediately headed west toward Saga. They arrived at the foot of Arashiyama, near the source of the Ōi River, rested briefly, and he said, "The sound still hasn't improved. How ominous! There will likely be a great fire." They left the populated areas and headed north, but since the same sound continued, he said, "This place also seems bad. There is a temple I know on Mount Atago. Take me there." So they climbed and climbed until they reached that temple. A monk came out and asked, "Why have you climbed the mountain so early?" to which he replied, "Such and such circumstances have occurred." When asked "How is this place?" he said, "This place is still not safe. I want to go to an even higher place." There was a Goma Hall there, and when told "Go to this hall," he entered the hall with great joy and said, "At last I can dwell in peace. The sound has finally been corrected," expressing his desire to stay there forever. However, soon earthquakes began shaking violently beyond description (referring to what people call the great earthquake of the Tiger Year). What could have happened? That Goma Hall was built as a suspended structure, and it soon collapsed and fell into the deep valley, becoming damaged, and Shikata-ichi also perished. He was probably over sixty years old. Until the end of his life, though he was one who knew people's fortunes and misfortunes to an annoying degree, he not only failed to know where his own end would come, but found peace in his place of death.

Diagram of the Earth

The Earth's circumference is 90,000 ri. Converting this using the Chinese measurement of one ri equaling six chō to the Japanese measurement of one ri equaling thirty-six chō, the circumference becomes 15,000 ri. In that case, from the center of the Earth to the surface is approximately 2,500 ri. The distance between the black dots in this diagram is approximately 1,500 ri. When we consider the range of the recent earthquake to be 200 ri, it corresponds to merely within the small circle shown in the diagram. From this, one should comprehend how minute the area of seismic activity is and how vast the Earth is.

○In my humble opinion, within heaven and earth, all creation has its foundation and manifestation. The foundation is the root, which is the "shin" (core/heart). The shin refers to the place where the震動 (seismic movement) is most intense and violent 【fierce】

The catfish theory - does it have basis in some book or other? Buddhist teachings also say it is the work of dragons. Ancient theories were generally of this nature.

○In the province of Sado, even now they commonly say "naifuru" as usual. If you say "jishin" (earthquake), they don't understand. It is noteworthy how ancient words remain in remote places.

○In the Sandai Jitsuroku, in the section on earthquakes in Ninna 3, it states "The people of the capital left their dwellings and stayed in the streets," etc. The state of the capital this time was also like this, quite extraordinary.

○Regarding earthquakes, concerning omens and such, the astronomical treatises of the Han Shu and Jin Shu record various responses, but from the Tang Shu's astronomical treatise onward, they record anomalies but not responses. This is based on the principle of the Spring and Autumn Annals.

Now, in this peaceful reign, what responses could there be? Earthquakes are disasters in themselves, and there should be no external responses. People should put their minds at ease and not neglect their respective duties.

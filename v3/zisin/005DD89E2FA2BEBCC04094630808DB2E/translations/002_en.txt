As is commonly said in the world, "Whether divination hits or misses, it's still divination" - this is indeed reasonable. However, the true essence of the I Ching is to take the divination sticks in hand with a clear mind, tell the gods of heaven and earth one's doubts and confusion, seek decisions and request divination, layer the dual principles of yin and yang, and only then learn the name of the hexagram. At this time, the gods show good and evil, but because fortune tellers have impure hearts and make poor judgments, they do not reach the accurate truth. Is this not frightening?

Even this great disaster was not without divine oracle. Though I do not know if it was true or false, on the last day of last month, in the dream of a Shinto priest serving at Kanda Myōjin, that deity appeared saying, "Though I departed for Izumo, I worry about injuries befalling my parishioners, and because of this concern, I have returned to tell you." Though this was託 in a dream, while thinking in his heart that something would happen, even upon reflection he could not understand it well. Thinking it might be warning of fire, he tried to tell various close acquaintances, but fearing he might spread strange rumors and face reproach from the authorities, he kept his mouth shut.

Perhaps even the gods find it difficult to reveal natural disasters openly. People also find it hard to deduce such things. Simply rejoice that being safe is due to the protection of gods and Buddhas.

This is meant to demonstrate faith to all people who witness these events.

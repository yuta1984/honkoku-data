   "A studded palanquin came as escort from Tayasu. She boarded it and evacuated from Takasago Gate. Since the earthworks inside Hanzo Gate had collapsed, she went around via Kudan slope and entered Tayasu. The escort included one palace official, Noda and other attendants, Sato, and myself. We returned around noon the next day, the 3rd. The attendants remained on duty."

1. From which hut area did the fire start?
   [Attached note]
   "It started from the neighboring estate's inner long house. Due to north winds, sparks fell toward our estate's subsidiary buildings, and fires also broke out simultaneously from around our Hatten Shrine's southern inner long house area"

1. Among the injured and elderly, totaling four or five people, there must surely be some with serious injuries. Who might they be?

   "I have written down the names on a separate sheet"

1. Regarding the fire at Lord Choshu's estate and other losses - this was surely a fire originating from that estate

Generally, those aftershocks continued for about three months, and so forth.

In the "Tenmon Kōyō" (Astronomical Survey), it says: In the fifth month of Kanbun Mizunoe-Tora (2nd year, 1662), the earth in Kinai greatly shook. Kitae (northern Settsu Province) was most severe, and aftershocks frequently occurred, continuing until the end of the year.

In the "Honchō Tenmonshi" (Japanese Astronomical Records), it says: On the twenty-ninth day of the second month of Hōreki 1 Kanoto-Hitsuji (1751), there was a great earthquake. Various halls and buildings were destroyed, and aftershocks continued until the sixth or seventh month before stopping.

Among these numerous examples, all show that after an initial great earthquake, while small tremors do not cease, there are no great earthquakes like the initial one. A friend of mine from Hiroshima has encountered great earthquakes four times in various provinces. Having stayed in each of those countries and knowing the circumstances well, he said that while small tremors continue for a long time, there was never once another like the initial one. This serves as sufficient testimony from a contemporary witness.

○Theories on Earthquakes

In the "Keisei En'gi," Kong Mo states: "Yang lies hidden beneath yin, is pressed by yin, and cannot rise, thus leading to earthquakes." In this way, when yang energy lies hidden in the earth and tries to emerge, it is suppressed by yin energy and cannot emerge, causing violent conflict and shaking within the earth. The words of Bo Yang Fu in the Zhou Yu section of the "Guoyu" are similar, and from ancient times, everyone has propounded this theory.

In the "Tenkyō Wakumon," it says: The earth is originally formed by the dregs of qi gathering to create material form. Since it is not bound within the rotation of primordial qi, it floats in the sky without falling. There are holes all around that connect with each other, like a beehive or the gills of a mushroom. The qi of water and fire lies hidden within. Presumably...

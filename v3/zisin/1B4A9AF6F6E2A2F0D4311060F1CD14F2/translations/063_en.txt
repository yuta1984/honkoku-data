　　Excerpts from the Record of the Great Disaster of Mount Asama in Tenmei 3
1. In the year Tenmei 3, Mizunoto-U, beginning from the 9th day of the 4th month, the mountain began to burn,
　and from then on, ash and sand fell daily without rest.
1. On the 3rd and 4th days of the 7th month of the same year, it was particularly violent. From Usui District's Sakamoto and Matsui
　da, Gunma District's Takasaki and other places, to Saku District's Karuizawa in Shinshū, and Hanzawa 
　District in Bushū, over a distance of 34-35 ri, ash and sand covered the ground
　to a depth of 3-4 shaku. Particularly in Usui District's Sasaga (place name, unclear) and other areas, it reached over 5 shaku
　in depth, making passage for people and horses difficult. The coming and going of daimyo large and small
　all took routes through Kōshū instead.

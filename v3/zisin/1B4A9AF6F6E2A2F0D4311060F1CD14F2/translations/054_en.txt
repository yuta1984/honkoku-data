encounters wind, the boats would be damaged by hitting the rocks. When pulling these boats up onto land, people from all over the island rush to help and pull up the boats with ropes as thick as one's arm.

The method of catching them is to insert an oak pole about six feet long into a harpoon, throw it into the air, and when it strikes the turtle's shell, the oak handle comes out and they pull in the remaining harpoon rope to bring it aboard the boat.

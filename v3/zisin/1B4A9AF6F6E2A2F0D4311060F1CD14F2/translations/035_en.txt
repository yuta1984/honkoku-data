Therefore, it seems quite reasonable that the sound was corrected in such circumstances. The "Suwen Wuyunxing Dalun" (Basic Questions, Great Theory of Five Movements) states "When wind prevails, the earth moves," and the "Kaigi Bendan" (Strange Phenomena Analysis) says, "Following this theory, earthquakes are caused by wind energy. Also, there is a popular belief about catfish causing earthquakes—is this from Buddhist teachings? Perhaps wind was represented as catfish? Fish are yang entities within yin, so they might be compared to wind. In any case, this is an explanation far from true principle." Hakuseki's "Tōga" explains that calling earthquakes "naifuru" means "nai" refers to sound and "furu" means to move—it signifies rumbling motion. Nowadays people also say "naiyuru." "Yuru" also means to move. "Yurufu" and "yurukasu" mean the same thing. In ancient language, abbreviating "yu" to "na" is exactly this. In my consideration, they also say "naefuru" in the Hokuetsu border regions. What is the basis for "nae" appearing in the "Sancai Tuhui"? If one says "nae," then contracting "nae" becomes "ne." "Ne" means root and refers to earth. There is no problem with earthquakes. "Yangzi Yan" states, "Eastern Qi calls roots 'earth'—this does not refer exclusively to mulberry root bark." Also, "ne no kuni" (root country) appearing in the Age of Gods volume of the Nihon Shoki probably refers to the earth. Another person says that "naiyuru" means "namiyuru" (wave swaying).

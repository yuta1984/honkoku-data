Qi tries to spurt forth and expand but cannot extend itself. It is like the sinews of the human body twisting and the pulse trembling. It also shares the same principle as thunder. The land beneath the North Pole experiences great cold, while beneath the equator it is extremely hot, but both have few earthquakes. In sandy soil, the qi is sparse and does not gather, so there are few tremors. In muddy soil, there is no place for qi to be stored in cavities, so there are few tremors. In moist and warm lands with many stones, there are cavities beneath the ground where hot qi blows in and is contracted by cold qi, and when this reaches its limit, it expands and violently strikes that land. For example, if cannons or stone fire arrows were fired beneath tall buildings and giant towers, they would inevitably suffer the shock and impact. However, the entire earth does not experience earthquakes uniformly. Earthquakes involve each place, each qi, and each movement—only affecting a single location. Depending on their severity, there are various changes, and examples of new mountains appearing on land and new islands in the sea are not uncommon. After an earthquake, when the dry qi underground intensely presses and transforms into hot fire and emerges, the trembling stops.

○Signs of Earthquakes

When about to shake, numerous holes appear in the ground at night, ejecting fine clods of earth, with field mice swarming about. This may be similar to the type of upheaval caused by earth dragons and such.

Also, old farmers say they can tell an earthquake is about to occur when they see something like smoke rising while plowing in the fields.

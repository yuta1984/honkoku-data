Recently, a great earthquake occurred in Kyoto and did not cease for several days. The master of Tōryōan brought a small record and requested that I write a preface. Looking at his record, I see that the current commentary and paintings address this matter. Therefore, I write about the omens of the Nin'na era in place of a preface, thus modestly fulfilling my responsibility.

Earthquake Study

On the second day of the seventh month of Bunsei 13, year of the Metal Tiger, around the hour of the Monkey, a great earthquake occurred and shook violently. The earthen storehouses and earthen walls in the capital were greatly damaged, and some houses collapsed. There were numerous collapsed storehouses, and most of the earthen walls and high fences fell down, with many people injured. Though we hear such things happened in ancient times, there had been no earthquake this severe in the capital's land in recent years, so people were surprised and frightened. Everyone ran out of their houses onto the main streets, spread out bedding to make temporary shelters with various preparations. For about two or three days, no one slept inside houses. Some moved to the precincts of great temples, others moved to riverbeds outside the capital, gathering in the western fields to pass the nights.

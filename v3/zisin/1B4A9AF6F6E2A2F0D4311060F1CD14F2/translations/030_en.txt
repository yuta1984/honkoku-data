In this case, from the earth's center to the surface is approximately 2,500 ri. The distance between the black dots in this diagram is approximately 1,000 ri. [Note] When viewing the range of this earthquake as 200 ri, it corresponds to merely the small circle shown in the diagram. From this, one should contemplate both the minuteness of the area where earthquakes occur and the vastness of the earth.

○In my opinion, in all creation between heaven and earth, there is a root and an end. The root is the foundation, which is the center. The center refers to the place where seismic activity is most intense. What spreads from this center in all four directions and gradually becomes gentler and more moderate is called the end. Therefore, it does not shake from the east, nor does it move from the west, but rather it begins shaking from its center and reaches the four directions, with its limits gradually ending in minor tremors. The area that shook this time had Kyōshi (Kyoto) as its center, extending to nearby provinces, with its ends reaching Tōbu (Eastern Japan), Nanki (Southern Kii), Hokuetsu (Northern Echigo), Western Shikoku, and Chūgoku regions. Even within Kyōshi itself, the northwest seemed to be the center. A person who experienced this earthquake at Higashiyama said that first, something seemed to stir up from Nishiyama, then suddenly dust rose in the city center and shaking came, and only then did they realize it was an earthquake.

○Regarding the signs preceding earthquakes, from what I actually witnessed: on June 25th of this year, when the sun set behind the western mountains, its color was like blood. Similarly, on July 4th, when the moon set, its color was also the same. According to "Wakan Gōun," from the 6th to the 20th day of the third month of Kanbun 2 (1662), year of the Metal Tiger, the sun appeared blood-colored morning and evening, and the moon likewise. On the first day of the fifth month, there was a great earthquake; the Gojō Stone Bridge collapsed, Kuchiki Valley crumbled, common people died, and it did not cease until July. According to Hiroshima-shi's record, in the eleventh month of Kyōwa 3 (1803)...

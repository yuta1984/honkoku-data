　　　Recording the Edo Earthquake
Breaking my hands, breaking my feet, beams and ridgepoles crushing bodies with no escape. Fierce fires blaze intensely, pressing close at arm's length. Noble and common residences by the tens of thousands—their foundations fly apart and collapse like mountains. Raging fires burn everything, as if hammers were shattering the jade and iron of Kunlun Mountain. Deep in the night, sorrowful winds blow without ceasing, travelers' souls tremble at the sight of blue phosphorescent shadows. How many funeral carriages carry out skeletal remains? For ten days, ghostly vapors chill the streets. Do you not see how the people in the castle cannot overcome this earthly calamity? Though they had lived secure, bearing Heaven above and treading Earth below, in one morning [the earth] unleashed its fury and committed cruel violence. Wailing cries reach Heaven, and Heaven itself is startled and laments. Alas! Fathers call for children, children call for mothers, the weeping of ghosts mingles with the weeping of the living.

　　Earthquake Ballad　　　　By the monk Seikyo, named Gessei, a person of Suō Province
　　　A certain earthquake record states: The great castle's watchtower gates and turret towers half-collapsed, Hanzōmon and the various gates of Yotsuya were severely damaged. All other towers, turrets, and battlements crumbled away, and countless sections of the moats' stone embankments collapsed. It also states: Fires broke out in various places, totaling fifty-eight locations. It also states: The dead numbered no less than 300,000. It also states: In Fukagawa and Ogawachō, when night deepened, there were sounds of something crying mournfully like weeping, like lamenting, continuing until dawn without cease. People considered these the wailing voices of wronged spirits. Above Yoshiwara, many spectral fires were seen—these too were formed from the condensed energy of vengeful souls. Therefore, this poem also touches upon these matters.

In the year Ansei 2 (1855), year of the wood rabbit, on the night of the second day of the tenth month of winter, at the second watch, an earthquake struck the Shogun's capital of Edo in Musashi Province. The disaster extended even to the castle of the military government. Even thousand-fathom moats were transformed as hills became valleys; roof beams broke and great buildings toppled. What force was this? Zhurong (the fire god) came to assist in destruction, smoke and flames filled the sky and raged forth. Lords and retainers, fathers and sons could not rescue each other, tumbling and writhing in anguish, crying out as they fell into fiery pits. Those crushed to death numbered approximately 300,000—more tragic than when Bai Qi buried alive surrendering soldiers. Do you not see how in ancient times, when the Zhou royal authority weakened and barbarians disturbed the realm, pressing toward the eastern capital?

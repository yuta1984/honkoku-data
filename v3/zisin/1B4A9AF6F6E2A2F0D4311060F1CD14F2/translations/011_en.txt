Heaven sends disasters to provide frequent warnings. In two hundred years, how many calamitous events have appeared? Regarding earthquakes, five mountains have collapsed, and two sages specifically recorded this in the Lin Jing (Classical texts). Now the four barbarian nations alternately insult us, yet the Shogun has not yet deliberated on personal military expedition. Therefore disasters continue to arrive one after another—mountains collapse, earth quakes, and ocean waves surge in alarm. In three to four years there have been over ten such calamitous events. Heaven's warnings are exceedingly clear. Those responsible for governing principles and managing yin-yang forces engage in expedient policies of peace with the barbarians, decorating a facade of tranquility while the glorious Shogun's government willingly makes treaties beneath the castle walls with dogs and sheep. The Imperial Heaven, Sovereign Earth, and all the deities blaze with震怒 (furious anger) and destroy the golden fortress. Alas! Rather than retreating from earthquake disasters only to die crushed, how much better to advance in battle and achieve glory and honor! Even if our military gains no great advantage, what harm would one battle cause compared to 300,000 lives? Speaking frankly, beneath the collapsed buildings throughout the city, crushed heads and severed limbs lie scattered in chaos; on black-mooned, cold nights of rain and snow, everywhere can be heard the mournful crying of ghosts.

Record of Mount Fuji's Sand Fall
A person named Zenzai from Bukō (Edo) told a visitor: "How extraordinary this was! On Mount Fuji's peak, three thousand jō down from the summit where the forest trees grow thick and dark, [the mountain] suddenly burned and collapsed, scattering stones and sand across the provinces. For more than ten days, rice fields, homes, and temple buildings were buried deep—more than one jō in depth. The people lost their dwellings and all starved to death, leaving desolate villages." This deeply moved my fellow practitioner. When he finished speaking, tears soaked his cloth. The visitor thanked him saying: "Truly extraordinary indeed, this matter of Mount Fuji! Throughout my life I have loved unusual events and always record them when I encounter something strange. I have never heard such an extraordinary account as this. Please, master, record this for me." I had no time to decline, so I casually took up my brush and recorded the following:
Now, Unkyōzan Jōkō Zen Temple is located several ri to the east of Mount Fuji, and I reside there. At that time, on the dawn of the twenty-third day of the eleventh month of winter in Hōei 4 (1707), the great earth shook and trembled with roaring sounds, toppling gates and doors. It was like a ship crossing the ocean encountering the violent surge of waves.

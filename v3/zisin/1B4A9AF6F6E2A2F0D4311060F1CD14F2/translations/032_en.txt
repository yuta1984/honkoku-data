Therefore, not a single person was injured. When I asked how they knew these signs, they replied, "Before an earthquake is about to occur, earth vapors rise up inside the mine shafts, and even people standing nearby cannot see each other above the waist due to the thick haze. We consider this a sign of earthquakes." Upon reflection, those who regularly enter underground know earth vapors well, and birds, being in the air, are well aware of rising vapors. When this earthquake was about to occur, thousands of herons were seen flying all at once. Also, a certain person saw a rainbow appearing in the northeast direction on the morning of June 27th, before sunrise. Rainbows normally appear facing the sun, but all these unusual occurrences should be considered omens.

○Regarding the Japanese name for earthquake, "naifuru," mentioned at the beginning, Master Kitaka says that "na" means fish, and based on this theory, he obtained an ancient diagram which is presented here. This diagram appears at the beginning of a calendar, followed by a calendar for the 9th year of Kenkyū (Year of Earth-Horse), containing approximately 355 days. I omit the rest. This is said to be a printed scroll calendar that emerged from old Chinese paper found on temple grounds in Matsuzaki Village, Naka District, Izu Province.

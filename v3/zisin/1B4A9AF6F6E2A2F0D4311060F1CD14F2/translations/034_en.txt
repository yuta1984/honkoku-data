"The same sound means this place too seems to be a bad location. There is a temple I know on Mount Atago. Take me there," he said. So they climbed up and up again until they reached that temple. A monk came out and asked, "Why have you climbed the mountain so early?" to which he answered, "Such and such things are happening." When asked "How is this place?" he said, "This place is still not safe either. I want to go to somewhere even a little higher." There was a Goma Hall at that location, and when told "Go to this hall," he entered the hall with great joy and said, "At last I can dwell in peace. The sound has finally been corrected," expressing his desire to stay there forever. Soon after, earthquakes began shaking violently beyond description 《marginal note: what people call the great earthquake of the Tiger year》. What happened was that the Goma Hall was built on scaffolding and soon collapsed into a deep valley, breaking apart, and Shikata Ichi also perished. He was probably around sixty years old. At the end of this lifetime, a person who knew enough to discern others' fortunes and misfortunes not only did not know where his own end would come, but found peace at his death place—this is indeed mysterious. Where good reaches its extreme becomes bad, and where bad reaches its extreme becomes good. This is always a tale of Muzen, it is said. In my humble opinion, Shikata Ichi's divination skills were more than praiseworthy. Having already known of heaven and earth's anomalies and escaped to Mount Atago was skillful indeed. Though the sound was corrected when he reached this mountain, there was still this change—this is the same as yin reaching its extreme and changing to yang, yang reaching its extreme and giving birth to yin, and joy reaching its extreme giving birth to sorrow. At that time, because of the great disaster throughout the capital, earthquake energy filled everything, leaving no road to walk and no place to flee, so Shikata Ichi's body also reached its limit here.

The volcanic activity was particularly fierce, and in mid-1st month of this year the fire blazed intensely, then somewhat subsided in late 1st month.

○ The fire of Mount Mihara had been gradually dying down, but on the 8th day of the 9th month it flared up violently again. The island officials' report reached the main government office on the 24th day of last month. Previously, the fire had erupted at Nakano-sawa, but now it has already died out. In the southwest direction of Mihara, the mountain hills cracked and burned, fire descended to Aka-sawa, flames burned fiercely day and night, smoke stretched across the sky, illuminating the sea all night long, and explosive sounds were particularly intense, like the sound of great stones falling from thousand-fathom valleys. The earthquakes were also severe. Aka-sawa is located between Sasaki-chi village and Nomasu village, less than two jō wide, one and a half jō deep, and about eighteen ri long extending to the seashore. Great stones collapsed and scattered horizontally and vertically around the valley, vegetation withered and died, all crops in Nomasu village's fields dried up and died, burned stones piled up in layers cutting off passage between the two villages. Tree leaves turned to ash and flew about, affecting the surrounding five villages. The islanders were greatly alarmed and gathered at the beach before dawn to bathe in water and pray at the new shrine. Another report came from the island with a map of the fire's spread along the valley. I respectfully submit this report. 6th day of 10th month, Tsuchi-no-e Inu year, retainer Egawa [name].

○ Retainer Egawa [name] reports: After submitting the island report on the 6th of this month, another letter from island officials arrived. About one ri east of Izumi-sawa village on Ōshima, there is a place called Chiri-sawa, from which fire erupted. From downstream of Chiri-sawa to the sea spans eighteen ri, and the current burned area extends six ri in each direction, advancing into the sea and battling the tide for sixty steps, about six ri wide. Molten great stones lie scattered, filling the sea. The force of flames is like swift thunder, making no distinction between day and night. The roaring sounds from within the earth are most severe, and at night smoke and light blaze red. The islanders can do nothing but bathe in water and pray at shrines. I submit this with accompanying maps and records. This is the report from the 27th day of the 9th month. 13th day of 10th month, Tsuchi-no-e Inu year, retainer Egawa [name].

○ Retainer Egawa [name] reports: The reports from the 6th and 14th of this month have already reached the main government office. Since then, the underground rumbling of the island fire has been like continuous thunder, and by the night of the 17th, the volcanic activity has increasingly

Sand accumulated greatly, the villages had no water, and people had to draw water from distant places. In the 5th year of the same era, in the 1st month, sand fell abundantly in Odawara domain, and fields became wasteland, so as petitioned, they returned the land to the magistrate's office and were granted replacement land. The assessed value was over 56,300 koku. {{marginal note: lower portion omitted}}

The Semiō-sō (Cicada Elder's Grass) states: From around the 20th day of the 11th month of Hōei 4, year of the Boar, the weather in Edo was overcast, extremely cold, and hazy. On the 23rd day, around the hour of the Horse (noon), there were tremors from somewhere, thunder rumbled frequently, and black clouds like spilled ink stretched from west to south. The evening sun shifted through gaps in the clouds, creating an ominous atmosphere, but soon the black clouds covered everything, becoming like a dark night. From the eighth hour (around 2 PM), mouse-colored ash began to fall. The people of Edo were bewildered and terrified, when an elderly person said, "Something like this happened thirty-eight or thirty-nine years ago. This must surely be ash from the eruption of Mount Asama in Shinshū Province." Hearing this, people regained some composure. Gradually, as evening approached and night fell, the ashfall became increasingly heavy.

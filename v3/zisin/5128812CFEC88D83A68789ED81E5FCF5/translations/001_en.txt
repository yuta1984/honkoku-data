Earthquake Song

"What a terrible great earthquake this time, houses all smashed up
The most distressed people panic, wondering which way
to go　Chorus　Crushed by storehouses and roof tiles,
children scolded by their fathers, finally crawling
and escaping, come this way now!

"Fires blaze up everywhere, those who flee move nimbly
hopping and wobbling, wondering which way
to go　Chorus　Running about frantically,
grandfathers pulling grandmothers' hands as they enter—
if only there were boats, come aboard now!

"Then the heavy rain starts falling, thunder rumbling
and lightning flashing, everyone soaked through
Can't sleep outdoors　Chorus　What trouble, what trouble,
such a commotion! Carpenters raise their wages and
get scolded for it. From now on the world will gradually recover, make money, come along now!

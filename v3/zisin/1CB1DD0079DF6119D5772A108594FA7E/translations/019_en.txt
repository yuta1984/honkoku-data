The sacred shrine cases continued in procession, illuminating the area around the official documents, the front-standing principal Buddha's shrine case, and the brocade curtains. Countless people thought, "If not now, when else could we carry the Buddha's sacred palanquin?" Without regard for propriety or ritual purity, they grasped the portable shrine, chanted the nembutsu with single-minded devotion, and followed it with tears of deep emotion. At the very front were the long storage boxes containing the shogunal vermillion seal documents, with guards strictly protecting the front and rear. Seeing this, tens of thousands of people exclaimed, "Now the main hall is also in danger! What kind of era has arrived that this world should perish now? To have been born into such a world of suffering!"

○From the 13th day of the 8th month of Hōei 4 (year of the boar), when the Buddha statue was enshrined in the current main hall, until now in Kōka 4, it has been 144 years, and now comes the evacuation.

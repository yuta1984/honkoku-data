On the right side of Horikiri Road, in the rice fields near the main castle, at a place originally called Karine-ga-oka, the portable shrine's resting place was determined. Curtains were hung around it for protection, and the tens of thousands of people who had scattered in all directions spent the night in the open fields, chanting the nembutsu in their hearts while gazing at the dawning sky, sitting there in utter bewilderment.

Even if I must accept this fate, I would decay and perish together with my wife and children at this place of death. As a child, I would exchange my own suffering for knowledge of my parents' safety; as a wife, not knowing her husband's whereabouts, she would end her life in vain. What strange and terrible times these are - should I be ashamed of others' reproach for being lost in love and affection for my wife and children and not determining my rebirth? Though worldly attachments are difficult to abandon for a while, if husband and wife should die, what would the young children rely upon to grow up? If we all die together, who would offer incense and flowers after our death? These are all the deeds of ordinary people drowning in the emotional love of blood relations. With single-minded determination, I rushed to the base of the temple gate, and as expected, it was like the dark night.

In that darkness, my wife and children called out to me and clung to me, and all those at the branch shop were safe, so I was able to calm my heart for the moment. However, without even inquiring about each other's well-being, we could only determine this as our place of death and feel grief and terror. Meanwhile, the crowd of people, separated from parents and husbands and having lost sight of their wives and children as traveling companions, called out their names searching for them with voices full of pathos that echoed around us. Lost about where to place themselves, their crying and wailing voices reached the ears of the heart, and voices could be heard saying "It's an earthquake! Don't panic!"

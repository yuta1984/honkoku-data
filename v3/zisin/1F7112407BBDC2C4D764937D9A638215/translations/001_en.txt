"Wealth Destroys Houses, While Trades Enrich Lives"

Wealth destroys houses, while craftsmen's trades enrich their lives—
The promises made behind latticed doors vanish like smoke,
Carrying soil and timber to temporary dwellings, making profits with large hoes,
Drinking sake, indulging in luxury with wood shavings and fine rice,
Living extravagantly, with storehouses
Daily plastering work
Even medical treatment
Is insufficient, yet
To tremble is
Both pitiful
And
Grateful for
The country's
Blessings
We look up to
No matter how much it shakes, this unshakeable reign—
　As a sign of this, even when thrown back,
　　This is Edo's true form

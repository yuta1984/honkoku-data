The father says:
"These guys are troublemakers who play pranks badly. Since we don't know what they might do, we must pray to these deities - Kairoku (the fire god), Kamo Daimyojin (thunder), and Kashima (the god who protects the earth) - to make them stay quiet."

■ Fire god
● Thunder deity  
▲ Catfish god

■ "Well now, Thunder-san, you haven't made a sound for a long time. You're being very well-behaved."
● "Well, I have no choice in the matter."
▲ "Why?"
● "Four years ago on August 4th, I played a big prank and ended up falling down. At that time my drum broke completely, and on top of that I hurt my lower back so badly that I can't return to India, so I'm still wandering around - I'm a masterless samurai from India now. Catfish-san, you sometimes get worked up, but the other day you were shaking and rumbling, and suddenly the hydrangeas were in full bloom - what was that all about?"
▲ "Well, I'm a creature of the water, so I don't know about fire."
● "Then what was that big disturbance about? The great fire that broke out started because of you!"
▲ "That was because there was disorder in the spring and summer seasons, and the yin-yang energies weren't in harmony. So when I get excited in the world, I start acting up - sometimes it's just a little, and sometimes I cause big trouble. There's no set pattern to it."
■ "So it happens because of seasonal madness? Do you go insane and dance around with your companions, turning everything upside down?"
▲ "Well, even thinking about it myself, I don't really understand."

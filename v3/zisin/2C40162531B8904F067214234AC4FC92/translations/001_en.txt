When the earthquake caused the wealthy man's house and storehouse to collapse greatly, the rich man was deeply distressed wondering what to do, when the fortune gods came and admonished him.

Daikoku: Listen here, this gold that you have accumulated since your ancestors' time - you cannot just be a guardian of money doing nothing else. The world's treasures require circulation; they must keep rotating around. Look, even though your storehouse is old and your house has collapsed, there's no need to lose heart. If you give half of your money to many people, through the merit of such virtuous deeds your own well-being will increase more and more, and houses and storehouses can be built again anytime. First, prioritize good words and devise ways to help people.

Ebisu: Exactly, exactly, just as Lord Daikoku says. At this time, there are many who give charity to the needy, and these people too, thinking of their descendants, put their own family fortune second and pray to us that there be no injuries or accidents. If you only practice virtue, it's natural that the gods will protect you. Won't you consider giving charity?

Mochimaru: Well, well, it doesn't matter what happens. I'll follow your instructions.

I understand. However, while keeping this money accumulated as is, if we take out just a little money and buy those catfish we see at eel shops and such, and release them into the great river, how would that be?

Daikoku: That's also reasonable, but why can't you give out money?

Ebisu: Exactly so.

Mochimaru: Hey, rather than releasing those catfish, let's string them up!

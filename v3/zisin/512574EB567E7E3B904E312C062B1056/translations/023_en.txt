【vermillion writing】"Palace inspection"
Sukejun Sukune and Outer Records Official Michikage went to inspect the palace for damage. First entering through the Ikuhō Gate, they found that the Bureau of Divinities had already suffered no damage. Next, they examined the eastern and western towers of the Ōten Gate, then proceeded toward the Great Hall of State, where the western tower was leaning considerably to the west. Also, the pillars of the Great Hall of State had shifted eastward by about one to two inches in places, and roof tiles were hanging loose, creating a quite frightening situation. Otherwise, aside from pre-existing damage, there was no major destruction. Next they examined the Shinka Hall of the Middle Court, then sent Official Supervisor Yoshiyuki to inspect the Bureau of Outer Records, where no losses or damage were found. They then reported these findings to the high court officials. Although the earthquake shook greatly, there was no destruction to palace halls and gates, which people found remarkable. Around the hour of the Sheep, people withdrew, and after nightfall there was again considerable earthquake activity. This was truly a great portent.

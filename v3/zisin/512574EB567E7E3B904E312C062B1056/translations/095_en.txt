In the villages downstream where the flowing water reaches, the eighty storehouses that had carefully stored various precious treasures in baskets—treasures sought by crawling into valleys with hands and fingernails during the day—all disappeared into the water in an instant, making it impossible to store rice or even know what happened. People who have been running since midday have hearts as empty as the sky, troubled (not being celestial storehouses or wild geese) and unable to progress with their hips against the Chikuma River, unable to escape and falling behind. The people drift and drown in the water like duck eyes, trying to reach their homes. This has been happening for a thousand years on the moss of ancient times—thinking of the distant past, from this imperial reign like the zelkova tree continuously succeeding to the present, over fifty reigns that have ruled under heaven are recorded in our imperial chronicles. The calamitous earthquakes recorded there appear again in this present world, treasure boxes violently collapse once more, and though farming has become impossible, all directions are blocked.

We pray that you will take pity on the sincere hearts of the people of this Shinano region who pray together, and grant us peace and trustworthiness, O deities of our land.

Short poem:
Even snow fears the earthquake that thunders with heaven and earth together, in people's hearts too
The rushing waters flowing from the earthquake's collapse—let us dam them up

A long poem composed about the earthquake that occurred
on the night of the fourth day of the third month of Kōka 4
　　　　A villager from Hanishina

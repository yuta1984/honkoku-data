Moreover, around the capital, temples, pagodas, and shrines everywhere—not one remained intact《Marginal note: omitted》.

Among these numerous cases, all begin with a major earthquake followed by minor tremors that eventually cease, but there are no major earthquakes like the initial one. A friend of mine, Mr. Hiroshima, encountered great earthquakes four times in various provinces, and having stayed in each of those regions, he knows the circumstances well. He said that while minor tremors lasted a long time, there was never again one like the initial earthquake. This person is still alive and serves as sufficient evidence.

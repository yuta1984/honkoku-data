Kanji 5th year, 8th month, 7th day, mizunoto-i, at the hour of the Monkey, there was a great earthquake. At Hōjōji Temple's Five Great Halls, the Gundari statue 《marginal note: height｜six [shaku]》was toppled by the tremor, the nine-story pagoda swayed and tilted like a shooting star, and the jeweled banners and necklaces of the central Buddha in the Golden Hall broke and fell. The seven Buddhas of the hall's central Yakushi Hall, the treasure-shaped roof of Kōen Hall, and the walls and decorative layers of Jōgyō Hall were all damaged by the earthquake.
Also, the treasure halls of Kongō Zaō at Mount Kinpu in Yamato Province were all destroyed by the earthquake. It is said this was unprecedented in ancient and modern times.

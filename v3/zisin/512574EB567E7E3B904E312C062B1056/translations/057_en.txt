According to reports, there were earthquake disasters in the territory of Kōzuke Province and other areas, with successive floods causing the people to decline and suffer damage. Although the Way of Heaven is lofty and distant and cannot be expressed in words, there must certainly be defects in governance that have brought about this spiritual reproof. The calamities befalling the people are brought about by my own actions—this is my responsibility. Despite my shallow virtue, I shamelessly feel shame before all under Heaven. When I quietly contemplate these faults, they are truly lamentable. How can it be that while the people are in danger, the ruler alone remains secure, or that while children suffer, the father shows no concern? Therefore, I have specially dispatched envoys to provide comfort and consolation. For those whose homes and livelihoods have been completely destroyed by earthquakes and floods, the envoys shall work together with local officials to deliberate and exempt this year's taxes and tributes. Regardless of whether they are common people or barbarians, relief shall be provided using regular taxes, assistance given for repairing buildings, those suffering from hunger and exposure shall be rescued, and those crushed or drowned shall be quickly buried. The intent of generous benevolence must be fully carried out to fulfill my compassionate heart.

The edict of the 9th month, day of Shinbō, states: "Recently, earthquake disasters have affected the common people. Fortune and misfortune depend on people, and calamities are not self-created. Perhaps we fear that corruption and deviation from proper governance have lost the hearts of the people, bringing down this severe reproof to startle and admonish us. In awe of Heaven's majesty, we cannot remain at peace, and divination is performed to announce blame at appropriate times. In ancient Tenpyō years, there were similar disasters that caused epidemics, leading to decline and injury throughout the realm. Not forgetting past events, the lessons to be learned are not distant. If the people are in distress, with whom shall we rule? Reflecting privately, Buddhist teachings are profound and mysterious, with great compassion as the foremost principle. The Way is subtle—there is nothing too small to be pitied, nothing too distant to be saved. Moreover, purifying and removing illness has precedent. Command all provinces under Heaven to establish purification rituals, gather monks at Konkōmyō-ji temple to recite the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra for five days, and also perform purification rites to remove inauspiciousness," etc.

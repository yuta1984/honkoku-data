From the great earthquake on the night of March 24th, the Sai River decreased daily, and the ferry crossing at Tanba Island became limited to one location. The nearby Susohana River, which normally flows into this river, also decreased daily, and as all rivers gradually diminished, it finally became possible to walk across the ford at Tanba Island.

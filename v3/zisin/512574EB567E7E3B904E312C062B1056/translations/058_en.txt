On the day of Mizunoto-U in the first month of Tenchō 7 under Emperor Junna, a post station report from Dewa Province stated: "The governor of Akita Castle fortress, Fujiwara no Asomi Yukinori, holding the rank of Junior Sixth Rank Upper and acting as assistant governor, submitted a report on the 3rd day of this month at the Hour of the Rooster, stating: 'Today at the Hour of the Dragon, a great earthquake occurred with a sound like thunder. At that moment, the castle fortifications, government buildings, and the temple buildings of Shitennō-ji including the sixteen-foot Buddha statue and the Four Heavenly Kings' halls all completely collapsed. Within the castle, fifteen commoners were crushed to death by falling houses, and over one hundred people suffered broken limbs and other injuries. This is unprecedented in all recorded history. The ground cracked and split—in some places extending about thirty jō, in other places about twenty jō, with no place remaining uncracked. Moreover, the great river by the castle called Akita River has dried up completely, with its flow reduced to a narrow stream like a ditch. This is perhaps because the riverbed split open and the water leaked through to the sea. Officials and people are in turmoil and detailed investigation has not yet been possible. Both banks of the Soegawa and Habetsu rivers have collapsed and become blocked, causing their waters to overflow.' {{Omitted in the middle}} According to regulations, this report is sent by express horse. However, detailed records of damages will be submitted separately."

The edict of the 4th month, day of Tsuchinoe-Tatsu, states: "Recently it has been reported that Dewa Province suffered earthquake disasters, causing changes in mountains and rivers, the collapse of castle buildings, injuries to people and property, and innocent commoners suddenly meeting untimely deaths. This is truly because there are defects in governance that have brought down this spiritual reproof. I am ashamed of my meager virtue before all under Heaven, and when I quietly contemplate these faults, I am deeply distressed. In ancient times, when mountains collapsed during the Han dynasty, they used moral cultivation to ward off disasters; when earthquakes occurred in the outskirts of the Zhou capital, they responded to good counsel to control the affliction. How then can the Way of restraining oneself and saving the people fail to follow ancient precedents? Therefore, I specially dispatch envoys to provide comfort and care. For those commoners whose homes and livelihoods have been destroyed by the earthquake, the envoys shall deliberate with local officials to exempt the current year's taxes and tributes. Regardless of whether they are ordinary people or barbarians, open the granaries to provide relief, assist in rebuilding houses, and ensure they do not lose their occupations. For those who died from being crushed or drowned, quickly proceed with burial, and strive to bestow generous benevolence in accordance with my intentions."

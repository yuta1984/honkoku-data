Postscript to "Considerations on Earthquakes"

Among natural disasters to be feared, none is greater than earthquakes. Even if the earth splits, mountains collapse, seas tilt, and rivers overturn, one cannot fly to escape to heaven. However, regarding cases recorded in ancient and modern chronicles, as well as recent anomalies in our country where buildings collapsed, walls fell, and people and livestock were injured, people generally view these as distant events and treat them as mere strange tales. Only after actually experiencing such events firsthand, when one's heart is startled and soul shaken, does one begin to reflect on those times and understand them as truly fearsome.

In this year of Kōin (1770), on the second day of the seventh month, the ground in Kyoto shook greatly. Aftershocks continue to this day without ceasing. People's hearts are restless, saying "If severe earthquakes occur, where can we rely for safety?" The people's rumors are also excessive, saying "On such-and-such day and time the earthquake will be severe," or "Such-and-such event is the cause of a curse," or "On such day violent storms and earthquakes will come together, compounded by warnings of bandits and thieves." People do not know where to turn, some abandoning their work and duties, even taking their families to flee to distant lands away from earthquakes. Master Sakiyama,

growing older and ever more sincere, pitied such circumstances and recorded these words to enlighten the people's hearts and dispel their confusion. Therefore, his language was unadorned and his research did not seek excessive detail. The Master of Tōryū received this, expanded upon it, and published it in print. I record its origins here.

It happened that someone explained to me the words of his predecessor: "There are certain implements that people today do not fully understand the use of, considering them inconvenient, not knowing that during major earthquakes, if one covers and shelters oneself with these, even though buildings may collapse and walls may fall, one's safety can be preserved. Also, the current lamp stands that hold candles are all preparations for earthquakes. These were considered and established in the aftermath of the great Hōreki earthquake. After the great Tenmei fire, people no longer knew to fear earthquakes, and today's construction only prepares for fires."

Seeing this, one understands that without actual experience and firsthand encounter, one's consideration does not reach such matters. This also shows how quickly people's hearts change. Therefore, I record this as well, hoping that people will maintain long thoughts through analogy and always have vigilance and preparation.

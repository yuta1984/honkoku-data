There were many. Lord Iiyama's castle was completely destroyed, and the flat terrain rose more than one jō in height, with the entire city area rising high and being completely destroyed. Moreover, fires broke out and everything was burned without remainder. Iiyama was a low-lying area that occasionally suffered water damage, but this time the flat land rose high across the entire area, so there was no flood damage, though there were many deaths. From this location through the valley route of Echigo Province, many places were destroyed and flooded, causing water damage to rice fields and farmland. There were several villages extending to Niigata, and the entire stretch of about 60 ri was in great devastation.

The water that flowed out also decreased daily, gradually drying up completely. The Tanba River also dried up, allowing people to cross on foot. When islands began to appear in the riverbed, the villages became alarmed and each built huts in the nearby mountain forests, retreating there to wait for the waters to return. Then, at seven o'clock in the early morning of the 28th day of the third month, at a place called Kawaura within Kinasa Village on the upper Susohana River, a location where water had been dammed up by landslides since the 24th earthquake burst through, causing a sudden surge of water. However, it was not an exceptionally large flood, so the villages were relieved. In the mountainous area upstream, at a place called Chikyōbara Village, there were eighteen houses in the Fujisawa group, but only four houses remained, with eighty-four people dead. At a place called Shiroshi in Umegi Village, four houses were all destroyed with twenty-eight people dead. In this place, not a single person remained.

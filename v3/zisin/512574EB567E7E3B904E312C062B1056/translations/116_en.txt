Not only have cultivated lands and homes been swept away instantly, but the situation appears to be developing into tidal conditions. The people lament day and night, so we have dispatched local officials to patrol and provide relief, but they cannot achieve stable settlement. This is truly lamentable.

Here too, floodwater has accumulated, and it is difficult to calculate the extent to which this village area may be submerged. Furthermore, the heights and depths of the Sai River's riverbed and embankments have become completely disrupted, and since the water still does not flow properly, Kawanakajima...

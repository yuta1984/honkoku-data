collapsed. Due to these matters, human efforts are exhausted, and the funds used for imperial prayers will surely result in considerable expense. Secret deliberations should be made to give respite to the people's administration. First, the people should be comforted, and then efforts should be devoted to the gods. When the people are at peace, the gods bestow blessings.

Following the precedents of successive generations, the matter of changing the era name should most certainly be carried out. Also, following the precedent of the Tenpyō era, official messengers should be dispatched to investigate the damage and collapse of shrines, Buddhist temples, and imperial mausoleums.

Regarding the Imperial Palace matter:
　As for the current palace, where the outer precincts have no trace remaining, is this truly suitable as an imperial residence? The imperial move to the Great Palace should not be subject to dissent. Even if there are one or two collapsed inner corridors, it should not resemble a detached palace with walls lacking substance. If there are repairs to be made under the name of Kan'in of the Great Palace, should there be deliberation and inquiry regarding the matter of taboo directions? Not limited to the walls of the Great General Prince Minister's residence, there are eight calamities requiring taboo observance, and the forbidden directions are not singular. Therefore, this alarms and reaches the authorities.

　The above two matters are reported with such brief considerations.

Furthermore, regarding actual heavenly and earthly disasters, they cannot be pacified through military strategy, nor can they be subdued through威勢. Unless through the benefits of buddhas and gods, how could such effects extend? This great earthquake has awakened people's hearts. When the tremors are sudden and urgent, and beams and pillars are about to collapse, all manner of strategies are forgotten from one's mind, the mysterious assistance of the Three Treasures is sought from the bottom of one's heart, there is no leisure to employ wisdom, and there is no way to borrow human achievements. Truly, one knows where the source of dispelling calamities resides.

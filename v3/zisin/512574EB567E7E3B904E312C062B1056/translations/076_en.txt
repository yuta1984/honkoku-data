In the mine shafts, ground vapors rise up, and even people nearby cannot see each other above the waist, as everything appears hazy and obscured. This is said to be a sign of earthquake.

Upon reflection, those who regularly enter underground know ground vapors well. Birds, being in the air, well understand ascending vapors. When an earthquake was about to occur this time, thousands of herons were seen flying at once. Also, a certain person saw a rainbow appear in the northeast (between the hours of the Ox and Tiger) on the morning of the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month, before the sun had yet risen. It is usual for rainbows to appear facing the sun. Since none of these are ordinary occurrences, might they be called omens?

This diagram appears at the beginning of a calendar, followed by a calendar for the ninth year of Kenkyū (year of earth-elder-horse), totaling approximately 355 days - the rest I omit. This diagram from Izu, from Naka District, Matsuzaki Village, came from within old Chinese paper at a temple. It is a printed calendar.

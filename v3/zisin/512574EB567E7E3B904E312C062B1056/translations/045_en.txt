"Such major shaking that threatens one's very life has not occurred before. It is truly extraordinary. Although small tremors continue almost daily thereafter, the divination texts generally say the same thing. Should any other anomalies occur, I would immediately be alarmed" (abbreviated below).

The 18th day:
"In fearful melancholy, I humbly receive word. The continuous earth movements inspire limitless terror. Even auspicious movements are not as good as stillness - is this what is being said now? I have received word of further anomalies" (abbreviated below).

Enbun 3rd year:
○ Entairyaku: On the 4th day of the 9th month of Enbun 3, around the Hour of the Rabbit at dawn, there was a great earthquake. People say it was unprecedented in recent times.

Kōan 1st year (Enbun 6th year):
○ Go-gumaiki: On the 22nd day of the 6th month of Kōan 1 (Enbun 6), day of kanoe-ne, at the Hour of the Cock, there was a great earthquake. There has been nothing like this in recent times, and it made one's heart shrink with fear.

On the 22nd, day of kinoto-ushi, at the Hour of the Rabbit, the earth shook greatly again. Like yesterday evening, there were great movements for consecutive days - something unheard of in previous generations. Seeking divination about this fearful phenomenon, a divination text was submitted to Daizen-no-taibu Yasunobu Chikayoshi Ason, stating that both days were movements caused by dragon deities.

Regarding the content of the divination text: this should not be taken lightly but should be feared. Recently, important figures in the military government are each in discord. Could this be a sign of major events occurring in the realm? The earthquake of the 6th month of Jōwa 5 (though not as severe as this time) - in that year, Lord Tadayoshi and Moronao came to battle. This time too, surely such events will occur again. How fearful.

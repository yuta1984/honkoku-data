Draft of the petition submitted at 9 o'clock on the night of the great earthquake of Kōka 4 (Year of the Sheep), March 24th
　　　　　　
　　　　　　　　　　Then at 6 PM, two official messengers
My domain in Shinshū Matsushiro: From around the Hour of the Boar on the 24th, the day before yesterday, there was a great earthquake. In the castle, residential quarters, turrets, and surrounding walls suffered extensive damage. Many houses in the samurai residences, castle town, domain villages, and other administrative areas collapsed, with numerous deaths and casualties. Particularly in the villages, there were also fires. Moreover, mountain areas experienced landslides that buried the Sai River, causing water to accumulate and eventually overflow. Of course, there is no water supply at all now. The Hokukoku highway's Tanbajima post station ferry landing has dried up. Depending on how these floodwaters burst forth, we fear that unimaginable geological disasters may occur.

For about two or three days, no one slept inside their houses; some moved to the precincts of great temples, others relocated to riverbanks outside the capital, and they gathered in the western fields to pass the nights. Even after three or four days had passed in this manner, there were still occasional small aftershocks from the remnants, which initially occurred as many as twenty times day and night, but gradually subsided to about seven or eight times, sometimes three or four times. However, even now that more than twenty days have already passed, the occasional slight tremors have not ceased, and all people remain confused and fearful. There is a popular saying that "earthquakes are severe at the beginning, strong winds are powerful in the middle, and thunder is most fierce at the end."

Based on this saying, people assume there will be no more great earthquakes like those at the beginning, but since women and children still cannot feel at ease and many people ask "How will it be?", I record these old chronicles and cite examples of small earthquakes continuing after great earthquakes to put people's minds at ease.

Regarding earthquakes that have occurred since ancient times, as far as can be seen in the national histories, they are recorded in detail in the disaster and anomaly section of volume 171 of the Ruijū Kokushi.

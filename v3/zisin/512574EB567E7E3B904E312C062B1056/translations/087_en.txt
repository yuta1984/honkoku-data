ordinances are practiced," the sky becomes overcast and shaking rains fall early, and military conflicts arise together. If winter ordinances are practiced, cold air occasionally rises and all vegetation withers. There is great fear in the land. The Theory of Cosmic Cycles states: "The years of hinoe-uma and hinoto-hitsuji are unknowable." Here, in this year of hinoto-hitsuji, on the day of mizunoto-u in late spring, at the hour of the boar, the great earth shook and in one stroke, all private homes, temples, pagodas, shrines and Buddhist halls collapsed, causing deaths by crushing and injuries. Mountains and rivers split open without distinction, muddy water gushed forth, blocking the flow of springs and ponds, with the lower areas rising to become peaks. In the village of Hirabayashi in the upstream mountains of Tanba Island River, Mount Iwakura collapsed several tens of jō, spanning between mountains for fourteen to fifteen chō in length and over one chō in width, blocking the great river. Therefore, the downstream suddenly dried up, while upstream the stagnant water was like a tide. Houses floated on the water surface for twenty days. On the third day of early summer at the hour of the monkey, the stagnant water at the blocked location overflowed, high banks collapsed in an instant, and the surging water reached toward heaven.

The torrent swept away people, cattle, horses, and dwellings in the four districts of Sarashina, Minochi, Takai, and Hanishina - the losses were beyond calculation. From Zenkōji along the Hokkoku Road, villages were washed away, all of Yokoyama was destroyed, Ainoki village was not only destroyed but also burned, and from Oshigane village and Yoshida village to the Sekikawa in Echigo Province. Particularly in Yoshi village, the mountain collapsed and families were buried together in the earth. The castle of Iiyama in Takai District toppled over, creating elevation differences of more than one jō. Throughout the entire city, everything rose more than one jō uniformly, and all houses were completely burned. Originally this area was a depression prone to occasional flood damage, but it became elevated ground - this water disaster was unprecedented. From here, various passage points through the Echigo valleys collapsed. Such floods damaged rice fields and farmland, extending approximately sixty ri to Niigata.

First, I am relieved that everyone is safe and well. I am reassured that all of you are without incident.

Yesterday, you kindly visited to inquire about our well-being after the earthquake. You took the trouble to come visit us, and it was indeed a rare earthquake we have experienced recently. I am particularly grateful that you made the effort to come, and I offer my sincere thanks.

Now, regarding the plants I presented to you the other day, you graciously gave us some confections in return, for which I also express my heartfelt gratitude. You have been excessively thoughtful, and I am deeply thankful. I am relieved that everyone is safe and well above all.

However, we had another earthquake again today, which has caused us some concern. Though this is but a brief letter, I write to express both my thanks and to inquire after your well-being. I send my congratulations while inquiring about everyone's condition.

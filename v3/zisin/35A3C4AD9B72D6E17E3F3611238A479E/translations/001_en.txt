Nanchūya (Nanchū Shop) Temporary Store

【Upper part of image】
Young man:
"Hey, you keep coming here so often, it's really troubling us!"

Catfish:
"I'm really in trouble this time too. After that big earthquake, the boss from Kashima scolded me harshly, so it's no fun staying at the bottom of the earth anymore. That's why I came out to set up this temporary shop."

Women:
"You're ridiculous, like a celebration dance!"
"We bearded ladies won't lose to you - you're the one from the other day, you fool!"

Impudent catfish:
"Hey! Shinshū, Osaka, Miyako - they say it's grilled large catfish! Don't make me laugh!"

Young catfish:
"Don't be ridiculous! I won't let myself be grilled before I even cause a big earthquake!"

"Hey, I can see those guys who are going to get hurt coming out!"

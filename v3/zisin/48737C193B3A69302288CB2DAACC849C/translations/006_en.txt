In Gunma District of Kozuke Province (present-day Gunma Prefecture), there once lived a samurai named Naganoi Shinano-no-suke. His wife, Lady Akebono, was returning from a pleasure trip when she rested by the Tone River and briefly fell asleep, during which she had a dream. A man wearing a suikan (court dress) and eboshi (court cap) came and took her hand, leading her into the water. She then awoke from the dream. At that very moment, the waters of the Tone River swirled backwards in a frightening manner.

This was when the Tone River was in great turmoil - there had been times before when the river flooded in exactly this way.

After this, she became pregnant, and as the months passed, she gave birth to a beautiful daughter like a precious jewel. The child was named Princess Katori. When this princess was three years old, her mother passed away.

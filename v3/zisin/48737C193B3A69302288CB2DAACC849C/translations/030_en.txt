Sano Genzaemon's Residence

One and a half ri from the Tokaido via the Tone River, in Sano village, the ruins of Genzaemon Tsuneyo's residence still exist today. The perimeter is about six or seven ken. Within it stands a stone shrine dedicated to Hachiman, the tutelary deity of Tsuneyo. Behind it is written "□ Monju-in." Those who seek the "Snow Chapter" are invited to stop by and visit when passing through this place.

"《Interlinear note: Great Earthquake｜Great Tsunami》／Adachigahara《Interlinear note: Third｜Act》Selected Lines"

【Each box from top to bottom】
Elderly bodies　at any moment
With logs　two-story old house
Startled with surprise　then collapsed again
Hearing "tsunami"　people fainting

Such has become　the ruined state of affairs
Digging holes and burying　pottery and such
But truly, truly　how unexpected
A ship's prow　entering the sitting room

Startled all at once　tumbling down, breaking through hedges
In back alleys　people fleeing to vacant lots
This is again　far too severe
On November 5th　in the evening

The aftermath I will　handle properly
Remaining at the gate　the head clerk
Now realizing　how arrogant
The long-nailed　landlord

Swaying and　kicking away forcefully
Large ships　pushed into the riverbank
Even for oneself　losing all patience
Patients being evacuated　on stretchers

Though clairvoyance　cannot be obtained
People who act as if they know when tremors will come
Hearing this, hearts　are not at ease
People who came　from Ise to serve

Though trying　to run
People who encountered earthquakes　on the way
Being driven away　at that bridge over there
Tea boats　that met the tsunami

With torn leather　of shamisen
In the midst of childbirth　swaying back and forth
The northern wife　of Hachiman Palace
The capital　that was peaceful

Beach evening mist　ready to take flight
Toba Bay　great tsunami
If you ask him　he would surely know
People who returned　from Edo

Taking time off　is of no use
Wages increasing　for shipwrights
Our　great ambitions hindered
Kyoto's　New Year theater opening

Lamenting is reasonable　in all matters
Theater teahouses
Firmly lowering　locks on latches
People fleeing to the countryside　with their families

Coming this far　they have come but
People who fled　scattered in all directions
At places where they never thought to cut ropes and flee
Boatmen　telling stories of the tsunami

Geishū Hiroshima
Great earthquake at the hour of the dragon on the 11th month, 4th day; another great earthquake at the hour of the monkey on the 5th; earthquake during the 6th; and another great shake on the 7th. From the mornings of the 4th, 5th, and 6th days, there were twenty-five or twenty-six tremors, with the remainder being too numerous to count. It shook continuously, making it impossible to stay inside houses, so everyone endured by sleeping outdoors. The castle's turrets suffered great damage, and the collapse and damage to samurai residences and townhouses was tremendous. There were some injured people. Several bridges in the city and on roads were shaken down and collapsed.
In the east, the Ōshū region also experienced earthquakes, but they were gentle with nothing particularly noteworthy.

In Tanabe, two-tenths of the castle town was swept away by tsunami, and the remaining six-tenths was destroyed by fire.

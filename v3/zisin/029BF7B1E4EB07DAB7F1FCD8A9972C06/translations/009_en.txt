In such a joyous imperial reign, this unavoidable extraordinary event caused by heavenly decree is truly lamentable.

Here, on the night of the 24th day of the 3rd month of Kōka 4, year of the Sheep, around the fourth hour of the night, a great earthquake occurred near Zenkōji Temple in Minochi District, Shinshū Province. To describe the details: beginning with Zenkōji Temple, there was violent shaking and swaying, causing the collapse of temple halls, pagodas, monastery buildings, auxiliary shrines, temples, and numerous private houses. Villages suffered fires, and rivers flooded. Because this occurred at night, the tremors continued throughout the night, resulting in casualties among people and horses.

To the east, the areas of Tanbashima, Kawada, Matsushiro, Yashiro, Togura, Sakamoto, and Ueda were particularly severely affected. Large stones rolled out onto the highways, the earth split open, and damage extended to Tanaka, Komoro, Oiwake, Kutsukake, Karuizawa, and the Jōshū border area.

To the south, Inariyama, Aoyagi, Aida, Kariyahara, Okada, and the Matsumoto area were also exceptionally shaken. Houses burned down and the commotion was extraordinary. The great rivers in the vicinity overflowed, causing casualties among people and horses.

To the west, the villages around Naganuma, Aramachi, Kashiwabara, Nojiri, and extending to the Echigo border, as well as countless other villages far and near - their numbers beyond counting. People of all social ranks, men and women, old and young, cried out for help, caring for children while lamenting and grieving. Their voices filled the fields and echoed in the mountains, creating a scene of indescribable pathos.

However, the main hall of Zenkōji Temple remained safe without the slightest damage, which truly demonstrates the noble power of the most sacred Buddha statue in the three provinces. Moreover, the excellent arrangements made by the magistrates and domain lords were exceptionally thorough, and the prevention of fires and floods was effective. Everything subsided by around the sixth hour of the following morning. That there were no deaths among people and horses is surely a sign of this peaceful imperial reign.

May relatives in other provinces find reassurance upon reading this account.

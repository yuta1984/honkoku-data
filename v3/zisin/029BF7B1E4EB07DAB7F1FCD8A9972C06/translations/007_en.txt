This was on the 24th day of the 8th month of Kaei 2, year of the Rooster (1849), at half past the ninth hour (around noon), when a fire broke out near Benkei Bridge. As it happened, the north wind was fierce, and this entire area was consumed without exception: Matsueda-chō, Matsushita-chō, Daichi, Kon'ya-chō, Kyūken-chō, Yamato-chō, Iwai-chō, Jōnōchi, Moto-Iwai-chō, from Daimon-dōri, Kamei-chō front and back, Kodenma-chō 1st to 3rd districts, likewise Shindō, Abura-chō, one side up to the middle, Ōtenma-chō 2nd and 3rd districts.

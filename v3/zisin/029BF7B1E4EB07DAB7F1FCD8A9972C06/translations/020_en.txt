【Upper Right】
Wind and fire (disasters). Be careful. 【Kanadehon Chushingura】 In the attire of night patrol and night attack. Forty-seven people with fire brigade banners, the great house is Oboshi 
Kuranosuke. Each with brave identifying marks, not mallet but bow lanterns. With fire hooks that look like spears.
After achieving fame in battle, on the fire extinguishing placard. The landlord holds his empty belly and
returns to his house, dragging out the appropriate person from the charcoal room
to eat chazuke (rice with tea). Really rising up

【Upper Left】
Renting a stove and shop. In Kamaya Horiura Nabe-cho.
From Otansu-cho. Through Kaitai-cho to Tatami-cho, spreading out
thinking it was Saiwai Bridge. Having an affair in Sukiya-cho
with a Shinagawa-cho woman, and if Mita then in Koji-cho, just a bit
also Inaba-cho. Making me into Anmari Baba-cho
Den-cho, now speaking up, Iidat-cho also thinks the master
is a substitute land

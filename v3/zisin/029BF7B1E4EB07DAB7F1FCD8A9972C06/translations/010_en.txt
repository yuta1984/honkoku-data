Proclamation from Kashima Shrine to All Catfish

Article One: Regarding the catfish, as has been decreed since ancient times, you are to observe the sacred verse: "Nine brings illness, five and seven bring rain, four brings drought, six and eight bring wind," and live modestly while watching for favorable seasonal conditions. However, while the various deities were away serving at Izumo, you violated the established precedents and committed outrages both in the capital and surrounding areas. Not only did you shake houses, storehouses, and people's bodies, but you also induced fires among your kind, burning down several locations despite there being no particular wind. This behavior shows no fear of the eight million gods and is absolutely outrageous. Therefore, you should all be caught without exception using four-pronged nets and grilled over fires on the main street at the eel-grilling shops. However, out of special mercy, you are hereby banished from all sixty-odd provinces of Japan. Should you hereafter approach any prohibited areas and commit mischievous acts, you will immediately be captured with seine nets and certainly prepared as drinking accompaniments.

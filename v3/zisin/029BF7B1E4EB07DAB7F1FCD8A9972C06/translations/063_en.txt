【Humorous Thirty-Six Poetic Immortals】

A collection of parody poems based on classical Japanese poetry (waka) from the Hyakunin Isshu and other sources, but with earthquake-related content substituted for the original themes. Each poem is attributed to famous classical poets but contains humorous observations about earthquake experiences, including:

- People fleeing and getting separated from their families
- Buildings collapsing and people being injured
- Actors taking breaks from performances
- Carpenters and craftsmen becoming busy with reconstruction work
- People preparing emergency supplies
- The psychological effects of aftershocks
- Observations about specific locations like Shimoda and Mishima
- References to Russian ships (likely relating to Commodore Perry's arrival)
- People's changed appearances due to shock and fear
- The contrast between Edo (protected by water infrastructure) and affected areas

The final poem mentions people running out in old undergarments and hakama trousers due to the strength of the earthquake.

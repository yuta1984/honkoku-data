Therefore, the people of the city carefully observe fire prevention above all else, pay attention to all matters, and all people act with prudence.

On the same day, a great earthquake caused great devastation, with roughly half of all houses collapsed, creating great confusion. The pitifulness is unbearable to describe. As recorded here, the Onshi (Ise Shrine priests) were preparing for New Year and had come up to Osaka, but some lost their calendars and gifts due to shipwrecks in this Osaka tsunami - truly an unprecedented event. The Grand Shrine, subsidiary shrines, and shrine families' houses also suffered numerous minor damages from the earthquake. In Shima Province around Toba, on the same day there was an extraordinary great earthquake with severe shaking that collapsed houses - roughly half the province collapsed, then a great tsunami struck, washing away most samurai residences and townhouses.

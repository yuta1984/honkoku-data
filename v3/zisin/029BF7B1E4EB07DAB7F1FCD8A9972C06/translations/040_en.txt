Copy of Official Notice to Welfare Officers and Price Control Officers

Item: Last year in the Year of the Ox, the diamond-shaped cargo ship loading guilds and wholesale merchants had been paying tribute money (myōgakin), but when irregularities among the wholesale merchants came to light, it was ordered that such payments were unnecessary and that all wholesale merchant guild associations be suspended henceforth. Since then, however, trading methods have collapsed, and rather than goods becoming cheaper, inconvenience has resulted. Therefore, wholesale guild associations are now ordered to be restored entirely as they were before the Bunka era. There shall be no more demands for tribute money, and with this understanding, proper pricing of all goods shall be established, prices reduced, and all trading conducted properly without price fixing, quality deterioration, shortages, or reductions.

Demanding substantial礼金 (礼金) and entertainment expenses from new members has long been prohibited by official decree. During the Kyōhō period, when various artisan and merchant guilds were established, it was also decreed that those in the same trade should not obstruct newcomers entering the business. While certain trades like medicine wholesalers, money changers, land bird dealers, water bird dealers, and calendar publishers have fixed membership numbers, there are no prohibitions against starting new businesses in other trades. Therefore, while wholesale guild associations are being restored, there will be no issuance of business licenses as in the Bunka period, and membership numbers may fluctuate freely. Restrictive regulations through trade agreements shall never be established.

However, for trades where unfixed membership would cause problems, thorough investigation is required, and without clear justification, such requests will not be easily approved. Understanding this, avoid following the commercial trends since Bunka, prioritize frugality and economy, avoid all luxury and ostentation, deeply respect the benevolent virtue of peace, continue your respective trades perpetually, live peacefully in the castle town, understand the blessing of this situation, earnestly consider the convenience of the four classes of people's livelihoods, and conduct honest business.

Anyone who misunderstands these instructions and disregards the orders in pursuit of private profit shall be arrested, investigated, and severely punished. Depending on the offense, business licenses may be revoked, so strict compliance must be thoroughly discussed and maintained.

Regarding these instructions, wholesale guilds must investigate their current status regardless of previous circumstances and report to the monthly duty town elder by the end of this month. Naturally, small-scale operators who only resell without purchasing inventory are excluded. Care must be taken to avoid confusion in investigating and reporting these matters.

Until thorough investigation is completed and respective judgments made, all merchants and artisans must understand the current circumstances and refrain from filing any lawsuits regarding their business affairs prior to these instructions. Should anyone misunderstand and file suit, even town officials will be held culpable. This point must be thoroughly understood.

These instructions have been issued by the Town Magistrate's Office. This notice must be promptly communicated throughout all towns without exception.

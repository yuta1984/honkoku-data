From the 5th hour of morning (around 8 AM) to the 7th hour of dawn (around 4 AM)
There was a great earthquake, and the mountains seemed about to collapse, causing people to be greatly
alarmed, falling and tumbling about,
with many fleeing.

numerous. Miraculously, the sacred
mountain, from the main hall
to the inner sanctuary, suffered no damage, and people
until daybreak
felt gratitude and relief.

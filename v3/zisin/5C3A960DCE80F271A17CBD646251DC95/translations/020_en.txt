The family members of those who had died from being crushed brought various items and came to request memorial services. A man named Hirata-ya Jinbei also came to help, recording the Buddhist posthumous names and secular names, presenting them before the Buddha, and requesting memorial services. When these matters are observed later, there will likely be much criticism from others. However, although thousands and tens of thousands of people died unnatural deaths and suffered unbearable pain, and their souls have departed this world, their corpses still lie exposed throughout the streets in great numbers. Perhaps one's own mind is confusing itself. 

Until the middle of the segaki (hungry ghost festival) ceremony, the weather had been clear and hot, but from the northwest direction, black clouds and strong winds suddenly arose, and rain began to fall heavily.

The rain swept along with the strong wind, blowing down the incense flowers and various other items that had been decorated in front of the Buddha from the altar. When people picked them up, they were blown down again; when they put them back up, they were blown down again, as if something were trying to snatch them away. The families of the deceased, and all the more so the people who happened to be present, sat on the ground, wringing their sleeves with tears of emotion, lamenting and praying. Soon after the religious service was completed, the weather cleared up in a truly miraculous manner. At times light rain fell, stirring up dust, wind, and clouds, and when the time came, the clouds dispersed.

The Susubana River was said to be the same. Not one person who heard this story knew whether it was true or false, but why would the flow of a great river ever stop? Coming out here, neither dismissing it as falsehood nor fearing it as truth, the rumors were various. Here, what kind of natural disaster occurred - the great mountain called Yamanka Kokuzozan or also Iwakurasan collapsed on both sides and pressed into the Sai River, blocking the great river. {{Marginal note: Matters concerning the Sai River area, also the Yamanka region, Kawanakajima, and flood disasters in the northeast of Kawakita will all be detailed in a later volume}} As they spoke of how terrifying it was, whether hearing or speaking of what kind of natural disaster it might be, their bodies trembled greatly, and their very beings shook.

Having barely saved their lives, and now here again, if such a great river were to overflow it would be unbearable, and they were at a complete loss wondering what kind of disaster the flood might bring. Here, Zenzaemon's family members began preparing to set up a hut from around evening, but they had only two spear poles from the Boys' Day festival decorations and three ceiling rafters, plus some broken bamboo, so they used firewood as stakes. However, there was no one to drive them in, so they picked up small stones from around the area and barely managed to drive them in.

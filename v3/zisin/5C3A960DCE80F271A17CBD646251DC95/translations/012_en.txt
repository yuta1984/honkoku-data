They were terrified and frightened in such a way that there was no place to rest their mere five-foot bodies, feeling as if treading on thin ice or crossing by boat, such that even the sufferings of hell must be like this - something that cannot be fully expressed by my poor writing. Eventually when the commotion settled down, each returned to their own hut and tried to prepare the morning meal, but water was scarce and they didn't even have proper buckets, so they put water in washbasins, picked and washed a medicinal amount of green vegetables to mask and wash away the filth, cooked this with miso, and barely managed to stroke their chests while finishing half to one small cup of food. They began preparations to repair their makeshift huts, arranging ropes and stakes with care, but the market town had been completely burned down. Even the barely remaining Nitta Ishido area had houses collapsed and destroyed, and everyone had fled in particular fear of being consumed by the great fire, so that not a single person remained in their homes. Therefore there was no way to purchase supplies, and they could only gradually rely on personal connections to weave ropes and work on constructing makeshift shelters. Moreover, in the mountains there were many places where landslides had occurred, and earth, sand, rocks, and trees together filled up the rivers. This caused storehouses to be knocked down, and tremendous numbers of people as well as cattle and horses lost their lives.

《Title: Various Occupations' Profitable Money》
【Upper section - Large character praise poem】
Earthquake
From
Reform
And
Still
The era

【Middle section right - Man with left palm open and right hand on money box】
This earthquake has already quarried most
of the mountain soil, but there still seems to be
great demand with many orders
So please protect the small trees
currently growing in the mountains
so they become large trees
overnight

【Middle section center - Man with one shoulder bare】
Whatever people say,
good fortune
means this
earthquake - from now on
I'll make big money, this is
the climb up success hill
Ensara hoi!

【Middle section left - Man looking up with hands in prayer】
I am
a tofu seller, but
these days carrying soil
brings big money
So I try carrying it, but
it's too heavy for me
Please protect me so I have
the strength of five or ten men. In return,
I will never let catfish go extinct, so please
grant my wish!

【Lower section right - Man with headband and rolled sleeves】
We have many favored customers, so
being this busy is troublesome.
I won't ask for anything particularly greedy,
so please protect me so I have
the strength of ten men.
I rely on you, Catfish-sama.

【Lower section left - Man holding koban coin with yellow purse at belly】
People randomly speak ill of catfish, but
Namu Earthquake Great Deity! First,
since you let us make so much money,
Catfish-sama's...

【Lower section left - Words without visible person】
Just
muddily
made a mess
but that's
very fortunate. I won't say anything too greedy,
but please protect me so this purse can earn
fifteen or sixteen times more money with lots of good customers.
If that happens, I'll offer your favorite
grilled eel, simmered white dumplings, and sake
in a gourd, so please grant my wishes as requested!

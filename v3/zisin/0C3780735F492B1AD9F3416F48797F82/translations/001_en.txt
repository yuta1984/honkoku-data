【Upper section - Man offering rice cakes】
This time I made unexpected great profits
However, those whose places were shaken to pieces or who suffered from fires
must be in great trouble, so I have the heart to sell everything cheaply
Even so, I still make profits, so it can't be helped
The one who has a money tree - that must be me
Namu Earthquake Great Deity, oh
Great-voiced Earthquake Great Deity
Please let me make great profits again!

【Middle section right - words from unseen person】
It seems to be thanks to being blocked
Unable to sip delicious soup for long
So wealthy that one cannot even go out for one night
Well, it seems too greedy, but
if this year brings 500 ryō, that would be good
so please protect us

【Middle section right - Man holding koban coins in both hands】
Thin fence gate... [text missing]
Whatever business this... [text missing]
Saving old koban coins... [text missing]
The profitable place is thankful... [text missing]
From now on, lightly setting up... [text missing]
Let's go out for window shopping

【Middle section - Man in arm guards touching his head】
Even eating roof-maker's bamboo nails tastes
completely bad in this world, but since
it's quite busy, it's fine
However, both here and there
happen only once, so although
one says it can be done,
being beaten with koban coins
is quite
tough

【Middle section left - Man holding fabric】
For people like us, without earthquakes, fires, and social disturbances
we cannot make profits. Without such things, it's like being in hell
To drink good sake, we need people's
tears to cover and bury, that's how bloody it is
Catfish-san, if you have good ideas
please teach us

【Lower section right - Man with hand in bag】
This earthquake brought no money
Places where word-of-mouth sales go up

【Lower section left - Man opening an account book】
Though people look down on us calling us construction workers, can construction work
make travel routes? The soil for travel routes is
useless. The local soil costs one shō of gold per one shō of soil
They say construction workers' children and Enma's children are the same
but I'm from Ōkura, and
for that mansion's needs, we need quite a lot
of earth and sand, so if we could bring
the entire Mount Fuji from Suruga
that would save us trouble and be good
This requires the power of
the catfish, or else
it won't work

Songs of Earthquake Preparedness
　Mononona (thing names) [Like the "mono no na" in the Kokin Wakashū, these poems incorporate the names of things]

　Ten Fish Names
When the noisy catfish shakes violently, quickly evacuate to the deep bamboo thickets

　Ten Bird Names  
Whenever pheasants cry, such days are troublesome - flee to the thickets and advance ahead

　Ten Insect Names
How dangerous, hearing that there were injuries makes me feel so deeply sad and melancholy

　Ten Grass Names
Though I hear the shaking has stopped and all is well, I shall sleep briefly on this crude bed

　Ten Tree Names
Days and months pass, and I worry anxiously whether it will stop - how frustrating to wait for earthquake-free days

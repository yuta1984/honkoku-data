Regarding the situation of people fleeing everywhere due to the earthquake

1. This person called "Yuri Kurou" (Shaking Trouble) is by nature from Yurisomemura in Namatsu-no-sho, Shinano Province, and being an unreliable, frivolous person, evil spirits have become missing persons, causing strange phenomena and shaking things up everywhere, which is absolutely outrageous. Regarding fires, it has been determined that they will occur from the night of October 2nd of this year (Year of the Rabbit) until the hour of Uma-no-goku (around 3 PM) on the following 3rd day. For people in distress, it has been determined that they are in hardship without homes. At present, as charity, they are eating sweet potatoes from three bales at the edge. For relief efforts, buildings will be erected at seven locations, and divine blessing will be bestowed.

1. Regarding the prohibitions of Kashima-sama, needless to say, we will ensure that the house does not lean in all eight directions. If this person considers the breathing of the women in the kitchen and secretly causes earthquakes, or if there is shaking and fleeing causing walls to fall, we will immediately settle the matter with sturdy beam logs.

1. Regarding worries, with the Ichiren-taku sect, the temple is Doshoji on the night-shaking hill, and in the city center there is Matsuhata-ka Soudoin temple amid great fires. There is no such shaking activation in the Yuri-shitan sect. Even if there are sounds and tiles are shaken from cracks, if there should be any return shaking, we will immediately come out bent and press down firmly with the keystone, and will not impose lodging fees to Noda. Each earthquake brings inexcusable misery.

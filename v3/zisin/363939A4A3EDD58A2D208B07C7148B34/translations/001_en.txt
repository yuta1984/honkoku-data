Tradesmen's Fortune

♪Oh my, though people can't tell by looking,
Being a building inspector is really an unpleasant job.
Since the earthquake, from morning to night
I've been running around doing
construction work, and someone's master's
money - closing eyes and mouth -
I withdraw and scatter it all around,
wondering if even the abacus beads
might come loose.
What I wish for is the privilege of my position -
I'd like to go to the evacuation
around Bakuro-cho.

♪How are things with your neighbor?
Oh my, they won't stay again.
Oh no, I can't figure it out,
so I'm in trouble.

Oh my, oh my, this is
truly grateful!
It looks like a hundred sen.
Oh, that looks painful!

♪Oh my, oh my

Well, well, this is...
♪Listen, during the earthquake
whether good or bad, it wasn't
needed, but once the work
is finished, there's plenty of sake
plus tip money.
It must be thanks to Lord Earthquake -
isn't that something to be grateful for?

Hmm
♪What, if I'm not
happy about it,
what else can I do?
This way now,
when I return home
I'll drink again. Carefree,
happily, well now...

...are performing their duties, there are those who find it difficult to serve as bridge guard duties on one side. Therefore, the guards and merchants have agreed that two people should be stationed each night. However, since we are strictly performing the small half-hour rounds and other duties, it is impossible to manage properly without changing shifts at midnight. Regarding the guards, not only when there are official bridge duties, but also when the number naturally decreases due to illness or scheduling conflicts, they must continue to perform night watch duties continuously. Therefore, we humbly request that special additional compensation be granted during night watch periods.

Furthermore, the expenses for night watch cannot be adequately covered by the previous provisioning methods used until last Boar year, so we humbly request with your benevolence that bridge maintenance funds be provided annually from October through March as detailed in the attached document. The above.

[I was directed] to work jointly with Saemon no jō in the same manner, and since then, whenever successive predecessors were appointed, we consulted and reported that [matters] would be maintained as before. However, regarding the three bridges of Eitai-bashi, Shin-Ōhashi, and Ōkawa-bashi, these were handled by my previous office, while the Edo-ward Honjo Fukagawa bridges have traditionally been handled by the former Tōyama Saemon no jō's office. If we now restore the old system, it would be more convenient, so should we exchange and handle [responsibilities] as indicated in the red notation? Furthermore, regarding the revival of various wholesale guild associations, I reported in the third month of the past Boar year that [this matter] would be divided between the North and South offices for investigation, and the division has been arranged accordingly. Should I consult with Ikeda Harima no kami with the intention of adding the red notation as indicated to the aforementioned memorandum? I humbly inquire about this matter. The above.

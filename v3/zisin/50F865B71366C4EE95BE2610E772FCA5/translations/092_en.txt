For the north, officials from the magistrate's office will be dispatched to the jishinban-ya (local guard post) in Muromachi 1-chōme to sound the wooden clappers as fire prevention alerts. Neighboring and nearby districts should continue the relay, and for districts separated by samurai residences, temples, and other areas around Kōjimachi, Akasaka, Ichigaya and elsewhere, the message should be passed along from the final district in the relay chain. Using the same signal system for communication, when you hear these alerting wooden clappers, you should follow the previous written instructions carefully and strictly maintain fire prevention measures. In addition to the existing fire watch duties, renters of houses and shops should form groups of three to five people each, and within these groups they should mutually look out for each other and must not be negligent in the slightest.

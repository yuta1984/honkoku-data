If you would kindly grant our request as submitted, we would like to receive the six months' worth of expenses from this October through next March on an annual basis. Accordingly, we are submitting this inquiry along with two copies of the separate petition and accompanying documents.

However, regarding the disbursement of the expenses mentioned in the main text, since these are to be provided from the designated land fees for the three bridges handled by the town elders' office, we believe it should also be communicated to the annual duty officer and the town elders.

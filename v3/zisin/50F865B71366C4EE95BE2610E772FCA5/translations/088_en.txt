In order to observe the situation, for towns where strict guard duties are thoroughly implemented, rewards shall be given, and those who are negligent shall certainly be subject to official judgment. If this is done, it should be effective. Regarding this matter, the text of the Bunsei-era town notices has been abbreviated, articles have been added to the regulatory code, and as shown in the separate document, this shall be communicated to all towns, and the nanushi should also be persuaded regarding their duties. Therefore, we respectfully submit this inquiry, attaching both the draft of the aforementioned town notice and admonishment document, along with copies of the town notice regulations from the previous Tiger year.

What still remains are the bags containing earthquake documents,
record books from Teimi to Boshin years,
large earthquake illustrations, flood maps, etc.
　　So that these various items will not be
　　scattered and lost until they reach future generations

With renewed spirit
　　what shall I
　　　　pluck?
　While my sleeves get wet
　　　with dewdrops
　　　　　　　from lily flowers

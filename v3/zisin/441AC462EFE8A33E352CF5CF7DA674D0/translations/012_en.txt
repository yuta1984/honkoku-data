These ruins are recorded here just as I recall them now, and although I fear inadequacy by including matters I do not know in detail, the entire mountain complex—including all the temples and subtemples listed in the side notes (Light Bright Temple, World-Honored Temple, Treasure Victory Temple, Perfect Vehicle Temple, Constant Virtue Temple, Medicine King Temple, Supreme Victory Temple, Virtue Longevity Temple, Original Enlightenment Temple, Good Nature Temple, Awesome Virtue Temple, Constant Dwelling Temple, Lotus Flower Temple, Honored Victory Temple, Teaching Temple, Auspicious Temple, Fortune King Temple, Treasure Forest Temple, Hall Light Quarters, Hall Bright Quarters, Elder Section Quarters, Constant Wisdom Temple, Long Nourishment Temple, Jewel Light Temple—totaling twenty-one quarters; White Lotus Quarters, Right Wisdom Quarters, Deep Waters Quarters, Constant Circle Quarters, Practice Lotus Quarters, Facing Buddha Quarters, Mirror Goodness Quarters, Nomura Quarters, Mysterious Proof Quarters, Good Practice Quarters, Faith Practice Quarters, Pure Vow Quarters, Virtue Practice Quarters, Following Practice Quarters—totaling fifteen quarters; Longevity Quarters, Forest Spring Quarters,称Name Quarters, Very Bright Quarters, Right Concentration Quarters, Lotus Pond Quarters, Constant Practice Quarters, Universal Light Quarters—totaling ten quarters)—with all their monks, middle-ranking clergy, and lay practitioners burned down all at once. Therefore, countless famous sacred Buddhist statues and precious treasures must have turned to ash. How pitiful, how lamentable! I shall inquire further and record this in detail in volumes four and five.

The diagram shown on the left depicts a phenomenon from the past, specifically from the 9th day of the first month of Tenpō 14 (1843, Year of the Water Rabbit) until around the beginning of the second month. A vapor like flag clouds was emitted from the northwest direction toward the southeast, but being suppressed by the light of the sun, its form could not be clearly distinguished, and those who saw it were also rare. From around the evening of the 2nd day of the second month, it began to emit this vapor, so all people who saw it felt it was strange and mysterious. Day by day, the time gradually became later. When viewed from the ground, its width was approximately six feet, its length was unlimited, extending southeast for several dozen ri, with its destination unclear. It gradually became thinner and naturally lost its form around the 13th night of the third month. Its appearance was as shown in the diagram.

○On the 28th day of the third month of Kōka 4, Hinoto-Hitsuji year (1847), the dawn sky was clear and there was no wind all day. From sunrise, the sun appeared reddish in color and its light was dimmer than usual. Since this occurred after such a great disaster, the people were frightened and alarmed, and offered prayers to the gods. By the following day, it returned to normal.

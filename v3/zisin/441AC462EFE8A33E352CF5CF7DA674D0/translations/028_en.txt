The situation was so indescribable that it left one wide-eyed and tongue-tied. I have recorded it as a marker so that future generations may learn how high the floodwaters reached, and I write this here with that desire to pass it on.

　　　　As it happened to be summer,
Even the rice-planting maidens rest at Koyasu Hall
Take care in bundling the rain-soaked rice seedlings
The hermitage is cool, wearing hemp garments in seedling season

From the occurrence of the great earthquake to this great flood disaster, in order to record the sequence of events up to this point in order, I have omitted detailed matters and may appear to have written only about my own personal circumstances. However, since this was a national calamity of vast scope, it is impossible to document all the details that unfolded before our eyes.

Therefore, I record the preview of later volumes below:

In Volume Three of the sequel:
　The names of towns, countryside, mountain villages, and villages affected by the three disasters of earthquake, flood, and fire, the number of deaths among people, cattle and horses,
　The detailed record of investigations conducted in various domains regarding the devastation of farmland and all manner of disasters
　The recording of the grateful acts of benevolent rescue efforts by the various feudal lords

It had been an earthquake without any particular reason, but in this great earthquake it was shaken and destroyed—the mound collapsed, the five-ring pagoda toppled over, and the site became a deep pit.

Ominously, someone composed a poem and called it into the pit:
　　O many ears of the Ear Mound, let us converse—
　　Did you hear or learn of such an earthquake as this?

From the bottom of the pit came a resonating sound, seeming to be a response poem:
　Even China must have shaken in this great earthquake—
　　Now at last the ears' holes have opened!

Looking down from the pagoda, they saw women, men, and even children rushing out of their houses in panic, and they could faintly hear voices saying, "This pagoda will fall to the ground at any moment!" Realizing it was an earthquake, they tried to climb down, but their hands trembled and their legs gave way. The pagoda tilted and sagged with creaking sounds, and the color of the sky in all four directions was like black smoke. Somehow the shaking finally stopped, and they thought they wanted to escape and climb down by any means possible.

One person who had climbed up while fingering prayer beads to form a religious connection with the pagoda was shaken and came down, composing this poem:
　　Like burning brushwood, I am utterly disillusioned—seeking salvation in the afterlife,
　　Now Yasaka Pagoda offers no merit at all.

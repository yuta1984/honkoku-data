　　Ten　About the Flying Light Phenomena

Those suffering from serious illnesses for a long time, and women who had recently given birth, lost their spirit and strength, and countless numbers died in the capital, losing their minds. Thieves took advantage of people leaving their townhouse homes open and taking shelter in makeshift huts, sneaking in to steal things and run away. The commotion of chasing them down, striking them down, and trampling them was endless. That day too ended and the third day came, but the earthquakes still had not subsided.

People who saw this spectacle said that no matter how you looked at it, this was no ordinary occurrence, and clamored that the world would be destroyed and humanity would perish. What people saw around Otsu Miidera Temple was similarly the same. A fireball that flew from around Teramachi-Sanjo in Kyoto heading south had a shape like a gourd with a narrow tail, was blue in color, and scattered fire like sparks from its trail. This is what is called "heavenly fire." On top of this, people began saying that a great fire would break out throughout Kyoto and burn everything to ashes.

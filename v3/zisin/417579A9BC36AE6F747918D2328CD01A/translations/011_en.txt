4. The Death of a Woman in Muromachi

In Nijō Muromachi, there lived a man known as Mukade-ya (Centipede Shop) So-and-so.

The parents and in-laws gathered around saying "Oh my, oh my," but it was of no avail. There was nothing to do but weep, and since there was no way to make sense of it all, the household members consulted among themselves and sent her to a temple, making her the master of a village graveyard mound.

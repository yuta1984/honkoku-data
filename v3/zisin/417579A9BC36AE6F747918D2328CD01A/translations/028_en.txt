People of good means had built storehouses to keep their treasures, thinking they could rely on the fact that even if their houses burned down, their treasures and tools would be safe from harm. However, most of the storehouses in the capital had collapsed and fallen down, while others had doorways tilted, eaves warped, walls cracked and separated, and earth crumbled and fallen, making it impossible to store anything even if there were fires. The sight of people carrying their assets and household goods to temples and shrines away from residential areas was one of severe congestion in all directions—east, west, south, and north.

The chaotic commotion throughout the capital, combined with the earthquakes, created an extraordinary level of tumult.

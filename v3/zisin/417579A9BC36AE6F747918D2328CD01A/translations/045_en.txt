(The dragon's) head and tail are bent down in one place, and the keystone is placed there by the deity's power. Therefore, no matter how much it shakes, the human world will never be destroyed. As an ancient person's poem says:
　　Though it may sway, the keystone will never be pulled out
　　　As long as the god of Kashima exists
Based on this folk song, records of earthquakes have been written and it has become customary to call it the "keystone" (kaname-ishi).

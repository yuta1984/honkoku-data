From around the morning of the second day after the great earthquake, people were crying "Fire! Fire!" and many
prepared accordingly, evacuating to Nijo Riverbank and nearby areas. We thought it might be thunder or heavy rain
and were satisfied with that explanation, but afterward there was truly only
a trace of rain, which fell on the night of the fourth at seven o'clock. From this morning, the situation has
settled down a bit, but depending on the location, people are still carrying
household goods and such to nearby areas even now. Truly, at night they are beaten by the night dew, and during the day they are scorched by the sun.
Even now there are occasional tremors, and people worry about fires, making it impossible to feel at ease.
The entire population is in distress. Our shop has been sleeping normally since the night of the third.
We never slept at the gate even for one night, so we are fine, but many
sick people have appeared among the general population, causing great distress. We can only pray that the tremors will stop soon and that everything will settle down

peacefully. In all of Kyoto, there is not even one percent of places where stone lanterns, stone monuments, and torii gates remain intact.
Even half-collapsed storehouses are gradually tilting with each
tremor, and there are many households with truly pale faces from their distress.
Kyoto and Kameyana in Tamba Province are severely damaged. It seems that in Otsu, Fushimi and other places, houses and storehouses
have also collapsed, but the talk is that there is nothing particularly serious.
To the east is Gōshū, to the north Wakasa, to the west Tango, to the south Osaka—this describes the extent of the damage
within these boundaries. Places like Osaka experienced truly only slight earthquakes. The situation is beyond
description in writing. Regarding this, the daily wages for carpenters, laborers, and plasterers are about ten
monme per day, but even so, it is not easy to get enough workers. Our shop sustained no particular
damage. First, I wanted to report roughly on these matters, but truly in this confusion, things are disordered.

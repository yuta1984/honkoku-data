The damage to other temples and shrines can be inferred, but it is said that many places suffered only light damage depending on their fortune.

Within the Imperial Palace, there was no major damage to the residences of the regent families (sekke), imperial family members, and court nobles. The collapsed walls and damaged buildings here and there were mostly similar. Along the townhouse streets, large houses only shook without major damage, while many small houses collapsed in various places. Most storehouses suffered considerable damage.

1. At our residence, the earthen walls on the west front gate side were unharmed, but the earthen walls on the east, south, and north sides were mostly destroyed.

The entrance hall resonated strongly, and the inner entrance hall, being a simple structure, had its roof fall. The earthen storehouse, treasure house, and未蔵 (storage building) suffered slight damage.

　Of the two rear storehouses, one suffered slight damage and one had damage. However, the two rear storehouses had their foundations reinforced since last month, the fences are fine, and only the walls fell. Since the places needing repair were from before this incident, it was fortunate.
　The north retirement cottage suffered some damage because it is a simple structure.
　　As a precaution, since it is naturally uninhabited, we have gathered at the main residence to the south and are getting by.
　　We plan to repair soon and return when the earthquakes subside. Everyone is getting by safely without panic and remaining strong. Please be at ease.
　　Our luck was truly good, which brings great joy.
1. The residences of family relatives have some minor differences but are generally similar with no major damage.

The extent to which this earthquake reached is not yet clearly determined. Even within Edo itself, we do not know what happened in other areas. However, I shall record a little of what I witnessed firsthand - the terrifying and pitiful scenes around Katsushika and the Ishihara area. A long poem in haikai style and five tanka poems.

In the second year of what was known for peaceful festivals, on the evening of the second day of the tenth month (Kannazuki), it was calm and people were quiet. Having pushed aside the lamps further and leaning against the desk again, suddenly an earthquake occurred. Before one could even say "that's right," thunder-like roaring echoed, and walls, pillars, ground, wall boards, earth, tiles, and leaves were all blown about like a mountain wind, with weary pillars in each house cracking, beams falling, and cracks splitting open.

Many people cried out in unison with sorrow, calling out desperately "Oh parent! Wife and children!" It was like monkeys in shops, with evening mist filling one's heart with heavy thoughts. In the night, within the "uhatama no" (a makura-kotoba or pillow word for darkness, night, black) darkness, smoke rose near and far, flames burned, and each spread out separately. Like daytime, wind-blown sparks scattered and mingled - who could there be to prevent them? Going far into the distance like wildfire, they finally extinguished naturally. When meeting acquaintances, we could only comfort each other by complaining together that our lives were spared. Though not exiles to new islands, our fallen circumstances left us without lodging, and like fishermen's bays carried along by earthquakes where high tides rise on rocky shores, there was no hope of drying out. In the confusion of crashing white waves, seizing the moment, we moved about the insides of storehouses that survived the fires and around collapsed houses, perhaps to disappear. As the earthquakes continued without even brief pauses, we sought to rest our hearts temporarily in a hut built with old timber on the west side of the garden.

Tsunamis occur for this reason. Since fire veins extend from one line to many lines, the reason why damage is great in regions adjacent to neighboring countries is due to whether or not they are affected by fire energy. The reason shrine and temple buildings suffer less damage is that the spacing of their foundation stones and the heights of their main beams differ from ordinary house construction. Tsunamis also occur when fire energy erupts at the ocean floor, causing sea tides to surge violently due to this. This does not mean there is a principle that tsunamis necessarily occur when earthquakes happen, but simply depends on whether fire energy arises in the sea or not. Or they occur when earthquakes destroy mountain ranges, break underground water sources, and cause them to flow into rivers and valleys. Also, regarding tsunamis, narrow mountainous and valley areas will suffer much harm, while flat and open areas will suffer less harm. The reason for this is that in narrow areas, water force easily surges up violently, while in flat areas, since there are no obstructions, the water force quickly subsides. Generally, it is like this.

Same book - Hokuhō's theory

Generally, when earthquakes occur, the weather is extremely warm, and starlight appears especially large - even small stars like those in the Pleiades and Orion constellations can be counted clearly due to their bright illumination. Hawks soar and crows cry, and they invariably sense this first in the great sky and respond accordingly. Upon consideration, there are holes underground like a honeycomb, where water seeps and yang energy constantly moves in and out, with yin and yang harmonizing appropriately as the normal state. If yang energy stagnates and cannot emerge, accumulating over months and years, the earth swells and water contracts, causing well water to dry up and the weather to become warm. For example, it is like when rice cakes swell up due to fire when being grilled. When it is about to shake, heaven appears near and stars appear close - this is not because the earth rises or heaven descends, but follows the same principle as mountains appearing closer before rain is about to fall. When the previously dormant yang energy bursts forth, the earth trembles due to this. Therefore, when it begins to shake

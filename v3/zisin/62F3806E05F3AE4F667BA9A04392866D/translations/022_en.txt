　everyone found this suspicious and dug him out, discovering it was Matsukazu. When they inquired about his condition in amazement, he was barely breathing and his voice was so weak it could hardly be heard. They gave him water and medical treatment, and he gradually recovered and was able to preserve his life.
○Matakichi, a construction worker from Kameido-chō, was at the neighborhood watch station (commonly called jishimban-ya, these are patrol stations in the districts; night watch duty begins in each neighborhood from the first day of the month to guard against emergencies, which is why he was there) when he was startled by the earthquake and returned home. His wife Take was standing in the main street holding their young son Sanjirō. When he asked about the safety of his mother Nobu, no one knew, so Matakichi alone rushed into the house. By that time, fire had started from the surrounding area and immediately spread to the house, and both mother and son died in the flames. When they looked at the burned ruins the next day, Matakichi's corpse and his mother's corpse were found separated by a tatami mat, which clearly showed that he had tried to use the tatami to shield against the fire and rescue his mother, causing everyone to shed tears of emotion.

○Denzō, a blacksmith who lived in the town in front of the main gate of Shinmei Shrine in Fukagawa Morishita-chō, was an elderly man who had gone out somewhere and was on his way home when he encountered the earthquake. He ran back home, and from under his collapsed house, his wife Tomi and daughter Iyo called out "Help us!" So he broke through the timber and rescued his wife Tomi (who was an old woman). He also tried to save his daughter Iyo, but a pillar had fallen on her back, pressing down and causing her pain. He found a saw and cut the pillar, but the pillar bent and became heavier, increasing her suffering even more. Meanwhile, the surrounding fire intensified and approached them. Knowing that rescue would be difficult under these circumstances, she said, "My life can no longer be saved. Please leave me as I am and evacuate quickly," but they would not leave and continued crying. Eventually the fire spread to this house as well, so they had no choice but to flee.

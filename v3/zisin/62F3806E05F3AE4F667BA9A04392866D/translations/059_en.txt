He hid himself in a bamboo grove, and indeed that night there was another great earthquake, as his father had told him. He remembered this story and could not forget it, so he spoke without thinking.

△The lord of Sendai domain sent several thousand pine boards as condolences to the lords of neighboring domains regarding this earthquake. This expense was paid from his personal treasury funds. Additionally, considering that the people of the four towns in front of his gate suffered fires and that their residences collapsed from the shaking, causing inevitable hardship, he immediately conducted an investigation and graciously provided one bale each of domain rice (containing 5 to 2 sho) to every household. He also gave two bu of gold each to town officials, guards, and construction workers and laborers.

△Regarding Niwa Nagato-no-kami, the guard at Babazaki gate, there is a story about Yamaguchi Shuhei from his domain, who had his right arm pinned down when the guardhouse collapsed, and as fire approached, had his son cut off his arm. (Details omitted)

Her father appeared and said, "You must not remain in this place." Having seen him here for two nights, she asked for leave from her service and went to her mother to tell her about it. Her mother would not permit this and scolded her, sending her back. But the next day, the great earthquake burned up all her clothing and personal belongings, though fortunately she was not injured.

The above is an excerpt from the "Record of Things Seen and Heard." Related to this, a printed book called "Ansei Record of Things Seen and Heard" has also been published. {Illustrated in color, three volumes} Edited by Ginkai Chōzen Gyofu, published by Hattori, released in early autumn of the year of the Dragon {this month}.

○The earthquake sphere diagram shown in the above record of things seen and heard differs from what I think, so I have presented one diagram on the left. I await corrections and additions from others. {Since November, many things have been omitted - those missed due to being out during earthquakes and forgetting to record after returning home, or minor tremors unknown due to sleeping deeply at night}

The Emergency Bright King of Teardrop Mountain is a creation of Yamachō Hōdaiji Temple, which built relief shelters. This principal deity fully encompasses the four great fears: earthquakes, thunder, fire, and fathers. Not only does it subjugate demons, but its sacred vow is to correct people's hearts and stop debauchery and laziness.

When manifesting as an earthquake, it topples the storehouses of the greedy and wicked. When appearing as thunder, it pierces the ears of the deaf, sends souls flying to heaven, and reforms merciless hearts. When manifesting as fire, it releases flames from collapsed houses, and if there's no one to extinguish them, they burn freely. As night turns to day, the fires eventually disappear without a trace. Even when people are left unable to hold chopsticks from crying, as long as they have life, some try to deceive by rewriting records. Then the father figure sees through this and sleeps outdoors. While extreme villains steal from those who flee after being deceived about coming rain and tsunamis, those with hearts as pure as waves are sworn to be helped. The sword of the Emergency Bright King is like the sword of parental advice. The thick divine message given to protect descendants tells them to grip their purse strings with one hand, so those who collapse and die will surely regret it.

Finally finding peace, when inquiring in detail about the origin of this principal deity, there was once a tale of the Earthquake King and gate conflagrations. When business was unstable and orders were received for Tahara-hyō, as relief for fires that broke out, people came in two-and-a-half portions of cotton garments, and temporary swelling pressed upon their bellies. At this time, Teardrop Mountain prayed daily for great inappropriateness, and through charitable rice distribution, the gate's collapse also became part of this sacred image's virtue. The poem from that time:
　At the gate again, rice was poured from above
　　The falling roof tiles caused obstruction

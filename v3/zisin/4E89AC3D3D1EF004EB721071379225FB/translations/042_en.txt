Now, regarding what we hear about great earthquakes, ancient times cannot be known, but in medieval times, in Bunroku 4 (1595) during the era of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, there was a great earthquake in Fushimi that toppled the Great Buddha Hall in Kyoto. In winter of Keicho 18 (1613), there was a great earthquake in Kyoto; in Kan'ei 10 (1633), a great earthquake in Odawara caused Mount Hakone to collapse; in Kanbun 2 (1662), there was a great earthquake in Kyoto; in Kansei 4 (1792), a great earthquake in Edo lasted seven days and seven nights. In the 11th month of Bunsei 11 (1828), there was a great earthquake in Echigo Province, and in Tempo 1 (1830), a great earthquake in Kyoto lasted about one hundred days, causing all travelers to return to their home provinces. Although such precedents exist, this earthquake in Shinano Province is an unprecedented rare event. The deaths of people and horses are too numerous to count, and the affected area extended approximately thirty ri in all directions. At that time, there was a special exhibition (gokaicho) of the Zenkoji Nyorai Buddha, and tens of thousands of pilgrims from various provinces encountered this great disaster. As mortal danger pressed upon them, those who rushed into the main hall

and clung to the Buddha statue in single-minded prayer—780 people—were uninjured, and the main hall, mountain gate, and sutra hall remained serene without incident. This should be revered and honored. Originally, in the 13th year of Emperor Kinmei (the 30th human emperor), this sacred image made of Jambu gold came from the three kingdoms and crossed from Baekje to Japan. However, Minister Moriya of the Mononobe clan, considering it a heretical teaching that would offend the divine spirits, had it thrown into a pond in Naniwa. Later, Honda Zenko, a resident of Shinano Province, was passing by the pond when golden light emanated from within it, and a natural voice called out "Zenko." Surprised, he searched the pond, found the sacred Buddha image, carried it reverently back to his hometown of Zakoji Village in Ina County of Shinano, and enshrined it on a mortar. However, due to divine guidance, it was moved to the present location in Minochi County, and the hall was built during the reign of the 36th sovereign, Empress Kogyoku.

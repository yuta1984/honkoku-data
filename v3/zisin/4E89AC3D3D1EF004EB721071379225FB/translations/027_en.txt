We humbly request that you grant us the loan. Without this, continuation would be absolutely impossible, and if we are further pressed by hardship to the point where people develop misguided sentiments, we would be deeply ashamed and worried. The people of the villages under our jurisdiction are sincere subjects who, unlike other jurisdictions in the same province, have revered the national benevolence since last year and requested to pay additional rice taxes, but it is lamentable that they are pitifully facing ruin and abandonment. We humbly request that you grant a long-term installment loan through your benevolent decree. Upon this, we will allocate the loan amount according to each village's needs, distribute it as loans, and regarding the matter of annual installment repayment, we will submit a separate inquiry document later. Therefore, we humbly request that you quickly grant the loan as requested and provide the funds. Accordingly, we have attached one ledger limited to the disaster-affected villages and submit this inquiry. The above.

　　Kōka 4th year, Year of the Sheep, 4th month　　　Takagi Seizaemon

In my domain territory of Minochi District in Shinano Province, on the 13th of this month after the hour of the Boar, the Chikuma River suddenly flooded. On the following 14th around 6 o'clock, the water rose 1 jō 3 shaku above normal level, and water rushed into the rice fields and farmlands of villages along the river. However, from after noon onwards, the water gradually receded. Although the castle grounds and samurai residential areas were not flooded, details regarding injuries to people and horses, damage to rice fields and farmlands, and damage to village facilities are not yet known. While I will report the details later, since this flooding occurred after the great earthquake, I am reporting this matter urgently first.

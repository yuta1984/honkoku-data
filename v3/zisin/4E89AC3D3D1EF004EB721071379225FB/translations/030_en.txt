In my domain of Matsushiro in Shinano Province, as previously reported, due to the great earthquake, Mount Iwakura in Yamate Village of Sarashina District collapsed and blocked the Sai River, creating a dam. On the evening of the 13th, this blockage burst through all at once, rushing out into the river course. In the villages, it broke through and overflowed the embankments on both sides from the water intake, and from there water surged across the entire Kawanakajima area. The force of water that rushed across the area from around Yokota Village of the same district, about one ri upstream from the castle town, to the downstream continuation of the Chikuma River was extremely strong. Water also accumulated gradually from downstream areas, causing further flooding, creating a backflow that reached right up to the residential castle, with water levels rising higher than the ground outside the castle.

We managed to hold it back with the flood-prevention embankments that were built after reporting to and receiving approval during the Bunsei era. Although these were severely damaged in many places and we rushed various emergency measures, the water receded before we could effectively prevent it. While no water entered the castle itself, considerable water entered the castle town. Due to these circumstances, downstream riverside villages were also inundated up to the Nakano Village area of your domain, appearing like a lake. As the water gradually receded, we immediately dispatched inspectors, but most of the large and small bridges were washed away. Moreover, even after the water receded, there were pools of water in depressed areas and places where roads had been scoured out, making passage difficult. We cannot even make a rough estimate of the damage. However, regarding the breach of the dam on the Sai River, as the water level gradually increased to a depth of over two jō, and as water slowly rose, the foothills of Mount Iwakura gradually eroded and collapsed. Much of it was gouged out from the base, and the water that had been dammed for several tens of days rushed toward Kawanakajima—

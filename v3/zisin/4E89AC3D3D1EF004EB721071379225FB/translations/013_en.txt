Year of the Sheep, April 5th　　　　　　　　　　　Sanada Shinano-no-kami

Regarding the villages in Kubiki District, Echigo Province, which are under the jurisdiction of Sakakibara Shikibu-dayū, there were reports of collapsed houses and fatalities from the great earthquake on the night of the 24th of last month, which I previously reported. Since the tremors continue daily without cessation, we are conducting official business from temporary huts made of reed screens outside the government office. Furthermore, there was another great earthquake around noon on the 29th of last month, causing additional collapsed houses and fatalities, and reports that rice seedling fields were flooded. There were also reports that the government rice transport bags were scattered. While there was no rain from the 24th to the 29th, it began raining from dawn on the last day of the month, and we have heard that strong winds occasionally blew and snow fell in these villages. Although I will provide details later,

I first report this matter as stated above.

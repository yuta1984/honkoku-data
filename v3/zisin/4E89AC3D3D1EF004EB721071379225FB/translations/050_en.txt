When they said "stay firm and don't go out," everyone scattered and ran, exiting through the east gate and stopping to stand in the grassy field where there were farms. There were few people in this place, and pitifully, among them were those wearing only underwear or even completely naked, sitting there shivering, with only the sound of crying and screaming audible - it was terrifying and wretched beyond description. They spent the night here, and when they traveled along the fields and embankments, there were several places where the ground had split open about one foot wide, which also chilled them to the bone. The stench of those who had burned to death was oppressive, and for about one ri from the temple, people were running about anxiously, calling out "flee, flee, another earthquake is coming!" - it was truly extraordinary, so said Hirokichi's mother when she returned and told her story.

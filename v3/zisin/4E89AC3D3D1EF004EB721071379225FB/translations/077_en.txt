On the same fifth day, under clear skies, there was a slight eruption around the Hour of the Horse (noon), and it intensified as night fell, sounding like thunder from far and near. On the sixth day, the eruption began around the Hour of the Sheep (2 PM), and from the Hour of the Cock (6 PM) it became even stronger, with black smoke rising violently, the earth shaking, and sounds like a million thunderclaps. The mountain base was enveloped in fire, with lightning-like flashes from within the smoke, sparks flying in all directions, and smoke drifting dozens of ri toward the northeast. The terrifying scene was beyond description. Even late into the night it grew more violent, and houses' doors and sliding screens rattled and shook within a ten-ri radius. People placed weights inside their homes and drove in wedges, but the shaking would not stop. Stones rolled off board roofs, and many small children cried through the night. From the mountain pass to the Takasaki area, thunder and lightning were fierce, with mud-mixed rain pouring down like torrents. This continued until the seventh day.

Due to these conditions, people from the post towns of Oiwake and Odai, as well as villages along Hikage-dori, fled to Iwamura-da, while others escaped with their families to relatives or neighbors. Particularly in Karuizawa, when burning stones began falling on the evening of the seventh day, people became greatly alarmed and agitated, covering their heads with door boards, placing buckets and mortars on their heads, or covering themselves with night clothes and bedding. Without distinction of gender, losing sight of parents and children, they fled desperately toward Takasaka-shinden and Shiga village. Six or seven people had stones fall into their buckets, breaking through the bottoms and striking their foreheads with the bucket bottoms. Lanterns were also knocked down one after another by the falling stones.

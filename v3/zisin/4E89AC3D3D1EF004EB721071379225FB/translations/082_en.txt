Regarding the Mud Flow in Northern Jōshū

North of Mount Asama, south of Kambara village, there was a great forest of over two ri called the Nagi Imperial Forest. The great trees had a circumference of five arm-spans and heights of twelve to thirteen jō or more, and since ancient times no axe had been put to them. However, people from Agatsuma District had petitioned to cut them down as annual tribute, and after calling woodsmen from various provinces and setting up huts in several locations, and going out to receive official permits, on the morning of the 8th day of the 7th month at the fifth hour (around 8 AM), the aforementioned forest caught fire and mud gushed forth, uprooting and washing away the great trees. Flowing out with the mud, it struck the seven villages of Kambara. The height was unknowable, and the width was about two ri. From there toward Naganohara it appeared to extend about four ri, with mountains, rivers, and houses all becoming a sheet of mud. Kambara had been a village of over 670 people, but only 19 people remained - all the rest were swept away. Though they were at the same foot of the mountain, Sanyō, Tashiro, and Ōzasa were unharmed. From there, 42 villages in Agatsuma District of northern Jōshū were swept away, with no trace remaining of ancient trees, mountains, or rivers.

without realizing it. This person had been on the second floor, it is said. The first to crawl out was Kawauchi-ya, and afterward one of his companions also crawled out following him, but since the other person did not emerge, they searched again through the broken hole, but could not find the person. While retrieving baggage from where their hands could reach, a man emerged from the opposite side wearing only an undergarment. When they called out "Who is it?" he replied he was from Mikawa Province. He said that of nine companions, only he alone had crawled out. "Then let us leave this place together," and from then the three of them traveled together. That night they stayed awake until dawn in the nearby mountains, it is said. Furthermore, waiting for daybreak, they left that place, passed through Nagoya, and lodged at a place called Omi-ya in Hifuku-cho Tamaya-cho. At that time, he told the story of the conditions in that land, and this was at the castle

town where news of the Shinano calamity first became known. Based on this story, illustrated prints were published and sold around town.
This Kawauchi-ya lost one companion, but fortunately obtained his baggage, so he was not troubled by lack of clothing or travel money. He also gave clothing to the Mikawa man, and though the route was roundabout, they traveled together to Nagoya, with him saying "I will provide the travel expenses," and thus the story was transmitted to this place. The Mikawa man, having lost many of his companions, hurried without taking frequent rests, rushing urgently back to his home province.

This was an imperial vow temple. On July 18, Keicho 2 (1597), by order of Taiko Hideyoshi, the Nyorai Buddha was moved to the Great Buddha Hall in Kyoto, but it did not accord with the Buddha's will, so there were frequent divine curses, and following the oracle commanding its return, it was returned to Shinano Province in August of the same year. This is widely known, and it is the foremost of Japan's three Nyorai Buddhas. Therefore, even during such extraordinary disasters as this recent one, the hall remained unharmed, and the lives of the sentient beings who took refuge there were completely preserved. Even in these latter days, the spiritual efficacy remains remarkable, and we should deepen our faith and reverence all the more.

destroyed them, set fires, destroyed Uehara Senya, and at dawn emerged at Yahata, where they destroyed four establishments: Senemon, Shichirōbei, Uemon, and Shichirōbei. In Shionada they cooked provisions at five houses. Having eaten these, they proceeded to Kashiwagi village, destroyed two grain merchants - Kitayū and Shingōrō, and at Matashirō's place cooked nine bags of rice. However, since there were only six or seven grain shops in Komoro and they were planning to attack and destroy them, [the authorities declared] that if there was any disturbance in the castle town, they would attack from the rear gate, and if anyone laid hands on the castle, they would be shot down with firearms. They prepared stone fire arrows and large cannons, summoned over one hundred foot soldiers from seventeen villages in the vicinity, and fortified gates in all directions. However,

the villains approached with groans and shouts, but hesitated as they could not enter the town entrance. At that moment, two or three temples happened to pass by and said: "This time, due to the high grain prices, your disturbances are unavoidable circumstances. There have been consultations with the grain dealers of Komoro town as well, and the temples will mediate. In any case, you should pass through the castle town peacefully. If there are any obstructions, there will be resistance with firearms from within the castle." When this was earnestly explained, the rioters agreed, laid down their banners, and said: "We are suffering due to the high grain prices, hence this situation. We only wish to pass through quietly until grain prices are lowered."

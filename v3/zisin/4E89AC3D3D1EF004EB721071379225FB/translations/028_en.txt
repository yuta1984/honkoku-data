I report regarding the great flood of the Chikuma River. Regarding the great earthquake that occurred on the night of the 24th of the 3rd month, which we reported again on the night of the 4th of this month: the earthquake caused a landslide at Kokūzō Mountain in the Hirabayashi Village area within the territory of Sanada Shinano-no-kami, located upstream on the Sai River. The landslide sent debris flowing into the Sai River, filling the riverbed and blocking the water flow. From that time until the 13th of this month, for a period of twenty days, water accumulated in the villages upstream. The ferryman at the Tategahana Village ferry crossing in Takai District, Shinano Province, under the jurisdiction of Takagi Seizaemon, to whom we had previously given instructions to be vigilant, reported at the fifth hour of the night on the same day that the Chikuma River area suddenly began flooding. When what appeared to be rising water was observed, the water level rose dramatically in a short time, which was quite alarming. This was likely caused by the breakthrough of the location where the Sai River had been blocked by debris.

Therefore, Seizaemon's deputies immediately made arrangements and dispatched rescue and flood control assistance to villages along the river. Soon after, villages near the magistrate's office were similarly flooded and houses were submerged. Nakano Village was unaffected due to its location on higher ground. People, cattle, and horses gradually fled to safety. As for the Chikuma River, by around the ninth hour of the same night, the water level reached approximately 2 jō 8 shaku, and along the river course, villages throughout the Echigo interior region had their rice fields and of course their houses covered with water. Since it was nighttime, it was difficult to accurately determine the water level. By dawn on the following 14th at the sixth hour, it was approximately 1 jō in depth, but there were fluctuations in water level for some time. Since the previous night, houses, various household goods, timber, and other items flowed in great quantities, and many people clinging to and taking refuge on thatched roofs were swept away, so there were likely many deaths and injuries in this unprecedented great flood.

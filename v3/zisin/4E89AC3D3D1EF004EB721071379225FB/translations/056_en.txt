The number of people [who died] is unknown, but it would likely be ten times greater than the deaths from the previous earthquake - a truly extraordinary disaster. From then on, the entire plain became water, rushing into Iiyama Castle, entering at three points from the Echigo border. The entire plain around Ogura and Tōkamachi was completely flooded, and water entered Nagaoka and the Niigata area, causing massive flooding. The scale was so enormous that it is truly difficult to put into writing. This great disaster in Shinano Province was truly more severe than any account could convey. As mentioned above, the ten ri stretch became a lake, with villages submerged underwater - several hundred villages in total. However, from around the fifth and half hour on the 24th until the seventh hour on the 13th - for nineteen days - the waters of the Shinano River accumulated like a great sea, but then all the water receded within three days. The sound was louder than thunder, making us think that heaven and earth might become one. The areas around Tanba Island, Kawanakajima, near Zenkōji Temple, Matsushiro, Naka-

no, Suzaka, and around Iiyama castle town - the entire plain became like a great sea, with all houses swept away. The number of deaths is unknown - such an unprecedented event since the age of the gods. In addition, the number of deaths among travelers on the Zenkōji and Hokurikudō routes is also unknown - truly a tremendous natural disaster. This flood disaster occurred in the mountainous areas of Shinano Province where the land is extensive, so over 200,000 koku worth of rice fields were destroyed. It is truly difficult to record everything, so I report this roughly.

Truly, while it is said that this floating world is like a dream, for Shibata to transform into a sea of mud in broad daylight was indeed a rare and extraordinary event. From the hour of the horse on the 8th, the rumbling subsided somewhat, though the smoke did not cease. By the following dawn, the sound gradually quieted, and the smoke also became progressively gentler, bringing relief to all people. However, the daily rising of smoke continued without stopping even after the year's end.

　　　On the High Price of Grain
From the great eruption of Mount Asama, smoke filled all directions, and despite clear weather, it hung over the mountains like spring mist. In the Jōshū region, leaves fell, while peach blossoms, cherry blossoms, and wisteria bloomed profusely, bearing fruit on their leaves, creating a spring-like scene. People wondered anxiously why such unseasonable weather should occur on top of such a great disaster, and what further calamities might befall them, finding no peace of mind. In Shinshū too, mulberry buds sprouted and peach trees bloomed in some places. Throughout August, the weather remained mostly cloudy, and both rice fields and other crops appeared to be regenerating unnaturally, showing no promise of proper harvest. Wondering what the future might hold, people began gathering knotweed in various places, picking leaves of adzuki beans and kidney beans, while mountain villages daily dug for kudzu roots, bracken roots, yam roots, and other wild plants as provisions for winter. The price of grain rose steadily higher.

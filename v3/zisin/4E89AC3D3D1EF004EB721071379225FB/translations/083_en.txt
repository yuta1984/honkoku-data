became nothing but a vast field of stones. South from the ruins of Kambara village, great stones like small hills had been pushed out, and besides these, stones of about fifty or twenty ken were countless in number. Going far down to the north, at a place called Yukiya village, in the sacred forest of the tutelary shrine, a seven-armspan oak tree stood upside down with its roots still pointing upward. With such catastrophic changes, the number of people and horses swept away and killed was beyond count. It broke through the Moku checkpoint and pushed out to the Tone River, burying the Goryō checkpoint. Here, what is called the seven-tenths flow of the Tone River flows out toward Hiratsuka, while the three-tenths flow falls toward Goryō and the new riverbank end.

Storehouses became like underground cellars, and people entered and exited the second floors of houses from ground level. Horses flowed in through the front garden gates, and while people were buried in kitchens, those who climbed to second floors and were saved spent twelve to thirteen days starving for food and thirsting for water.

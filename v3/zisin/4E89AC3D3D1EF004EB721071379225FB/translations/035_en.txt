The people along the Zenkoji Highway all climbed to the high mountains in their respective areas and camped outdoors day and night. Around April 11th-12th, water began to flow little by little into the Tanba River system, so they reported to the domain administration that there might be breaches upstream. Following instructions given by various officials, village headmen each brought workers to construct waterways in their jurisdictions. However, on the 13th at the hour of the Monkey (3-5 PM), the upstream breach suddenly caused a massive flood. Workers and officials climbed mountains 2-3 jō high, but the floodwater reached about 4-5 jō in height and came rushing all at once. All the men and women from villages who had been living on those high mountains, as well as officials on duty and other foot soldiers, were swept away without exception, resulting in enormous casualties. We will continue investigating and report accordingly. The above.

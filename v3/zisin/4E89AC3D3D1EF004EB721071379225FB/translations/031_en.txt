—such was the situation that occurred. To prevent this, we hastily constructed emergency flood-prevention embankments using stone-filled straw bags and other materials on the left and right banks downstream of the ferry crossing at Koichi Village in Minochi District. However, this was for the sake of Kawanakajima and other riverside villages in your domain and private territories. We mobilized not only laborers from within the domain but also large numbers of people from neighboring villages that might be affected by flooding, working energetically on the construction. Yet due to the vast and torrential force of the water, it could not hold even for a moment and was completely swept away. 

Additionally, Mount Magami in Koichi Village of Minochi District had previously collapsed, with a section about twenty ken high and ten ken wide pushing out about eighty ken into the Sai River, leaving only a narrow remaining river width. If left as it was, even a small amount of water would cause the river course to change, so we ordered intensive excavation work. However, with many rocks and stones making the work difficult to complete, this great flood immediately swept everything away, pushing massive stones that would be difficult for hundreds of people to move downstream or into the farmlands of riverside villages, where the water depth reached over six jō.

As a result, among the riverside villages, Yotsutani Village in Sarashina District was instantly reduced from over eighty houses to only six or seven remaining, with all others completely swept away, turning the entire area into a riverbed. Due to this, some villages had all their houses swept away. Moreover, in the mountain areas, many water-soaked mountains collapsed, causing large trees to flow out, and many houses were knocked down and swept away by these. The number of houses lost was roughly over six hundred, and additionally many houses were filled with stones, sand, and muddy water. We hear there were also drowning victims, but this is not yet clearly confirmed. Furthermore, in downstream villages, the depressed farmlands still have water pooled to a depth of about one jō, and we cannot possibly make even a rough assessment of the damaged lands. From around Tanbajima post station on the Hokkoku Highway to the area where the Chikuma and Sai Rivers merge, the entire area became turbulent rapids, and Tanbajima post station as well as the Hokkoku

There are many poems composed about the smoke, but records of major eruptions are not yet found.
During the reign of the 106th Emperor Go-Nara, there was a major eruption in the fourth month of Daiei 7 (1527), year of the fire boar. In Kyōroku 4 (1531), year of the metal rabbit,
                    252 years until Tenmei 3
on the 22nd day of the 11th month, heavy snow fell and accumulated to depths of six or seven shaku in some places. The 23rd and 24th were clear days, and it snowed intermittently again from the 25th to the 27th. However, on the 20th, Mount Asama erupted violently, and large and small stones fell like rain within about two ri of the foothills. Particularly at a place called Ōhara, about 700 boulders fell. These were named the Shichihira stones and still exist today. The ash and sand fell over an area extending thirty ri. What is called Mugen-ga-tani

is around Mount Asama, where jagged rocks tower menacingly. What is called Maekake-yama conceals the burning mountain facing Saku District. In the valley between Oni-no-kiba-yama and Kuroo-yama, where the aforementioned heavy snow had accumulated, it all melted at once due to the heat of the burning stones. Moreover, from the hour of the monkey (around 4 PM) on the 27th, heavy rain began and continued day and night without distinction until the 29th. The burning stones from the mountains were pushed out into the valleys, and many villages at the foothills were completely washed away without a trace. Afterwards, the highways became impassable roads, but the local lord at that time ordered the nearby villages to clear away the small stones, and the road reconstruction was completed within four years. Even now, halfway up the mountain, the highway is entirely made of burning stones. These did not fall from above

They report that it is two ri away. Due to this muddy water, carp, crucian carp, eels, and similar fish floated to the surface and drifted to the riverbank, where they could be caught in great quantities by hand. As there was a previous official notice about this matter, I humbly report this unusual occurrence via post relay.

Of those who survived in Kambara Village, ninety men and women were unharmed, but having no means of livelihood, they had scattered in all directions. In late August, they were called together and a large grass hut was built, where they gathered to live, each pursuing their trade to sustain their precarious lives. Then the government granted them two hundred ryō and ordered them to somehow continue and develop their village. This made them feel as if they had been revived like thirsty people finding spring water, and their joy knew no bounds. Now, though many people had gathered in this poor dwelling, only about twenty couples remained intact, having not lost husbands or wives to the disaster. Thinking this situation too uncertain, regardless of age, they decided to appropriately pair people up and arrange marriages. The elderly served as matchmakers and guardians, and on September 20th, designated as a most auspicious day, they held a mass wedding ceremony.

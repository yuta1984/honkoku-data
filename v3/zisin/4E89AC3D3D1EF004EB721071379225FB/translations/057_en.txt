In the area along the Sai River, at a place called Aniwa Village, a landslide from the western mountains pushed into the river,
blocking a large river that extends over one ri, and even now the water cannot flow out anywhere.
From Aniwa Village upstream as well, for about one ri in width and about four ri upstream, water has accumulated, suddenly forming a lake.
Most of the people from the villages fled up into the mountains, but their homes became like floating debris in the water.
Near Tanba Island, it became so shallow that one could walk across, and rice seedbeds could not be prepared. Moreover, since it's unclear when
the water will flow out, the villages in the river basin are in great distress. This is truly an unprecedented
extraordinary event.
　The three villages of Makinoshima, Tanokuchi, and Ishikawa suffered no flood damage, while all other villages
　were submerged underwater.

On the 17th day of the first month of Kōka 4 (1847), during the day, a mountain as shown in the diagram appeared
at a place called Kitsu Valley in Takeno District, Tango Province. This place called Kitsu Valley is
seven ri from Miyazu.
　This diagram was drawn based on detailed inquiries made directly to a person
　from the Kitsu Valley area who had long been in service in Kyoto,
　returned to his hometown this spring, but recently came back up to Kyoto.
　It is thirty-six ri from Kyoto to Tango.

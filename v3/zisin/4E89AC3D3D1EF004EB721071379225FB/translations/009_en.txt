In my private domain in Takai District, Shinano Province, from around the hour of the Boar on the 24th the day before yesterday, earthquakes were strong. The magistrate's office, samurai residences, and tenement buildings were damaged in several places, peasant houses in the villages collapsed, the ground cracked in several hundred places with sand and mud spouting out, and my entire territory was affected by subsidence. Even now earthquakes occur from time to time. There are no injuries to people or horses in my domain. However, I hear that among those who had come to worship at Zenkōji Temple or for seasonal work, there may have been deaths, but the investigation has not yet been completed. Regarding the details,

I will report further in due course, but first I report this matter.

　Correspondence from Zenkōji Temple in Shinshū to Zenkōji Temple in Aoyama, Edo
I urgently dispatch this express messenger to report: On the night of the 24th at the fourth hour, there was a great earthquake here. Fire broke out in the lodgings, and in an instant the Spirit Hall buildings, Palace buildings, and Treasure Repository were all destroyed by shaking and completely burned down without exception. Though I speak with reverence, the Main Hall and the Sutra Repository in the temple grounds remain standing. The entire temple precincts collapsed, and the deaths among townspeople and travelers are countless. Among my retainers, Ren-tō, Jundō, Suda Shōsaku along with his two grandchildren, and the Nishikawa women died instantly. On our side, children and retainers died instantly, but we barely escaped with our lives.

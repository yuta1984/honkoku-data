It was heavily cracked in an octagonal pattern. Mount Sudaka can be seen directly below Mount Asama. This forest was said to contain thousand-year-old great trees and exceptionally famous trees, and when entering the mountain, it was so dark due to the tree cover that it was like night and one could not tell direction in this deep mountain. However, it appears that the burning stones fell upon it, and around the first day of the eighth month, smoke was still rising, everything was completely burned and looked like charcoal, appearing jet black. The crater was considerably burned and collapsed. The condition of the crater showed cracks to the west and splits to the east, and it appeared that the breaks extended all the way down to the valley at the foot of the mountain. The depth of the crater was unknowable - smoke filled the entire mouth of the crater so the inside could not be seen. Looking at the breach on the north side of the crater, it was about five jō deep, with its bottom unknowable. The group of ten men climbed to the rim of the crater around the fourth hour (10 AM) on the first day of the eighth month.

The terrifying nature of it was beyond description. They finally descended the mountain and rested at the foot, when at the ninth hour (noon) it burned intensely with smoke rising up. At this dangerous moment, they immediately looked at each other's faces in alarm.

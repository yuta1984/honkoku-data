Beyond that, from Itahana to the Takasaki area it was over one shaku deep. East of this point, only sand fell. Following this pattern, about one sun fell in Edo, over two sun in the areas of Kurihashi and Satte along the Tone River, and a small amount fell in the Choshi area of Hitachi and Shimōsa provinces. This is about seventy ri from Mount Asama. Near Haruna Shrine there is Ōnari Pond, and while the pond water dried up to about three-tenths of its usual level, no stone or sand fell behind the torii gate, which people revered as the divine power of the deity.

In Kōzuke and Musashi provinces where the sand fell, from the eighth hour (around 2 PM) on the seventh and eighth days, it became pitch black with thunder, lightning, and tremors, making everything incomprehensible. People lit lamps in their houses and used lanterns to travel the roads. On the morning of the eighth day it became slightly brighter, but from the fifth hour (around 8 AM) it became dark again. From Karuizawa to around Okegawa on the Nakasendō, the roads and fields became a uniform flat surface, with all vegetation buried without exception. Standing trees had no leaves, bamboo was all withered like snow-broken stalks with no green leaves. It stood stark like a snowy morning.

Many monkeys, deer and similar animals were struck dead by the burning stones and flowed out into rivers, their bodies hairless. Even the various beasts and birds that happened to survive eventually starved to death for lack of food. Nothing lived except cats and chickens. Thus the sound of the eruption was felt not only throughout the Kantō region, but extended to Owari, and even to Ise, Harima, and the Takasago area. As the rumbling did not cease by the eighth day, people had no sense of relief, and at various shrines and temples they offered earnest prayers.

The Great Eruption of Tenmei

When Asamagatake usually emits smoke, major eruptions are rare. It is said that when the smoke ceases for a long time, sulfur gas accumulates, and thus a major eruption occurs. The place where it smokes is called "kama" (cauldron). With a circumference of one ri, the center is hollow and entirely made of sulfur. However, due to a minor eruption five years prior, this cauldron was filled and became flat ground, and smoke completely ceased to rise. But from the spring of Tenmei 3, year of the water rabbit, smoke gradually began to rise, and regardless of winds from east, west, south, or north, it always drifted toward the east-northeast direction. Folk tradition held that when the smoke drifted westward, calamity would occur. Indeed, during spring the smoke frequently drifted westward, and although everyone said calamity would come,

the great eruption from the 6th to 8th day of the 7th month was unprecedented. First, from the late hour of the snake on the 26th day of the 5th month, eruption began, the earth thundered, and smoke rose several hundred jō high, appearing about 20 to 30 ken wide, like piled cloud peaks or layered cotton. On the night of the 18th day of the 6th month, a great eruption occurred; on the 29th of the same month, it cleared and from the hour of the horse there was a great eruption, thundering noisily since the 26th day of the 5th month. On the 1st day of the 7th month it was clear, at the fourth hour it became cloudy with light rain, from the middle of the hour of the sheep eruption began, at the hour of the monkey it became extremely violent - stronger than the 29th of last month. From evening the eruption subsided. On the 2nd day, from the middle of the hour of the horse eruption began, weaker than the 1st day. Again from the hour of the sheep it became a great eruption, stronger than the day before. At the hour of the dog it was extremely strong, ceasing to roar at the hour of the tiger.

When they said this, the message was conveyed to the respective officials, and they were allowed to pass through as requested. That day was already October 4th, and from the seventh hour (around 4 PM), the leading banners - eight or nine of them broken and raised at the front - passed through Komoro completely by evening. From there, the rioters destroyed Bunemon's place at Nunoshita and advanced toward Chiisagata. They divided their forces into two groups: one hand pushed along the main highway, while the second hand took country roads through villages, threatening each household to provide one person to reinforce the advance, or else they would set fire to their homes. With no choice, some were dragged along with them, though some hid along the way and secretly returned home, while others were surrounded by the crowd and went along in confusion. They destroyed Kōzaburō's place at Hoboya, then the advance guard destroyed Zaemon's place at Matsudaira Ichimasa's administrative post, and set fire to everything including warehouses and sake shops, causing extensive destruction. From there they proceeded to the administrative office at Nezu, destroyed the pawnshop of Kyūzaemon, destroyed Jōemon's place in Higashi-Ueda village, then destroyed village headman Chōgorō of Tanaka-juku in Matsudaira Iga-no-kami's domain, destroyed Seizaburō in Kaizenji village, destroyed village headman Sōemon of Koida village in Sengoku Jizaemon's domain. At Akasaka village, sake dealer Ichirōemon offered one hundred ryō in gold to the advance party and apologized, so they withdrew without incident, but then the second wave arrived in great numbers and destroyed his place anyway.

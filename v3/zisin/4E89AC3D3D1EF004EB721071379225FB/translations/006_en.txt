Fires immediately erupted and everything was burned down completely. There were numerous injured people, and the commotion was beyond description. However, since the main hall of Zenkōji Temple was unharmed, not a single person keeping vigil inside the hall was injured. Echigo and Jōshū provinces also experienced fires from the tremors and flooding from major rivers - truly what could be called an ordeal of water and fire. In the castle town of Sanada, the ground split open, 178 houses collapsed, and about 60 people went missing. In Iiyama castle town as well, a great landslide occurred. There were also people from Owari Province who had been staying overnight for pilgrimage to Zenkōji Temple that same night, and some returned home with various accounts. The death toll in the metropolitan area was said to be 26 people - an unprecedented disaster since ancient times.

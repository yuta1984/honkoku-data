There were places where [such activities] were prohibited, so songs and various musical performances ceased in the streets, creating a desolate and lonely scene. Last year, Mino and Owari suffered crop failures and there was unrest along the roads, so there were no pilgrims to Ise from Shinano and the Kantō region. However, the autumn harvest of the Year of the Rabbit was the most abundant in recent years. Particularly in places like Ōmi, the yield was said to be 120 percent of normal. Nevertheless, high prices were universal throughout all provinces, so many merchants and artisans fell into poverty. Within Kiso, Narai and Hagiwara had about 900 households, and in normal times they made their living by crafting utensils such as tiered food boxes and dining trays, with only about 100 households engaged in agriculture. The remaining 100 households [also made] such utensils, but since the world was suffering from crop failures, there was absolutely no [market for them].

They tried to sell [grain], but since grain prices were so high, there was no way to continue. At this point, the Lord of Owari provided relief by giving each person one gō of rice daily to make gruel, measured out in five-gō containers. The cost of provisions was said to be five ryō each, indicating the severity of the crisis.

Thus that year also came to an end, and when the new year dawned—the first month of Tenmei 4, the Year of the Dragon—they welcomed the auspicious new spring. However, grain prices continued to rise even further, so the Kawakami region fell into great hardship.

We believe there is no merit in this matter.

Item: Regarding water mills, one shall be established, and as for oil, it shall be sold only within the city, with sales in rural areas being prohibited.

Concerning the above article, we believe that due to your assessment of oil shortages in the city, you intend to limit distribution by restricting operations to one water mill location. Whether there are other intentions behind this, we do not know, but if this is your assessment, even without limiting it to the city alone, there should be no trouble for the townspeople. Particularly with water mill pressing limited to cotton seeds, when white oil increases in luster, its usage decreases, and due to significantly lower prices, it becomes inferior to seed oil and ends up as low-grade material. Therefore, even if directed toward the city, there will likely be sales from the same location to rural areas, and we believe it would be difficult to calculate the convenience of using it all the way to the city.

Furthermore, regarding indigo cultivation and other farming in our domain, the labor force is insufficient among our domain's people, so day laborers from neighboring domains are brought in, creating high-paying work. Even women work as textile workers in their spare time, primarily engaging in agriculture. With few rice paddies and fields in mountainous areas, and no widows, daughters-in-law, or others taking the lead in agricultural work, those who do not farm or the elderly and young who engage in textile work day and night can barely make ends meet. If cotton seed prices were lowered, even modest prospects could be established. At a place where even minor interference with the livelihood of poor textile workers should be avoided, restricting to one water mill would tighten purchasing methods.

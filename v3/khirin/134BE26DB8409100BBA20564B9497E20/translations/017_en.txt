Memorandum submitted

One matter regarding water mills: First, one [mill] shall be established, and the oil from it shall be sold only within the city markets, with sales in rural areas being prohibited according to your instructions. We respectfully surmise that these regulations are based on your assessment that the urban oil [market] is unhealthy, and thus you have limited [operations] to one water mill location for sales only within the city. However,

Regarding the establishment of public regulations, we previously made a rough estimate of raw cotton entering the domain, and at that time it appeared there might be approximately 500,000 [kan] of cotton seeds. While we believe this to be a rough estimate, in recent years in the northern districts, cotton thread of about 100,000 bundles per year has been processed using the newly introduced long looms called "Jindai long machines." For the cotton fabric used in these machines, raw cotton is ginned and spun into thread for commercial purposes, and we hear that this raw [cotton] has increased by approximately 200,000 kan over the past seven to eight years. Additionally, among the thread being produced, there is what is called "Awa cotton," and since white cotton fabric has been woven from before, only the thread used for long looms [amounts to] four to five hundred [units], so white cotton may become less [available].

Nevertheless, considering half of this raw [cotton], we estimate an increase of 100,000 bundles, so there should indeed be 500,000 kan in total. We hear that one water mill location can press approximately 120,000 kan per year. The amount pressed by human power in various small locations is minimal, and there is no way [even] half of the large amount could be processed. In such circumstances, conversely, countless cotton seeds [would go to waste], which we believe would be unprofitable for the domain.

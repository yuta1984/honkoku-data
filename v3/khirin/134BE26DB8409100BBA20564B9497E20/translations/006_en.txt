Oil prices should not be raised without reason when selling, and measures should be taken to ensure trade does not stagnate. If the seed dealers in Osaka, Sakai, and Hyogo, as well as the oil wholesalers in Osaka, engage in improper conduct regarding the receipt and handling of goods, the shippers should file complaints with the Osaka magistrate's office and receive investigation. Now that these principles have been proclaimed anew, if there are improper acts such as selling oil seeds (that should be sent to Osaka, Sakai, and Hyogo) or oil (that should be sold to Osaka oil wholesalers) elsewhere or in secret sales, investigations will be conducted and punishments will be imposed, so these rules must be strictly observed.

Given these proclamations, matters concerning investigations within our domain will be announced later after deliberation, so understand this accordingly. Generally, regarding oil production, those who were investigated and found to be engaged in oil production in the previous Year of the Rat should continue operating as before. However, they must strictly observe the prohibition against procuring seeds from other domains, and all should work together to lower oil prices by dedicating themselves to their trade. You must notify every person in your group villages without exception, collect written acknowledgments, and submit them. This document should be circulated smoothly to all. The above.

Respectfully Submitted Record
Regarding the matter of oil production this time, we have been granted interpretation of the traditional governmental regulations' intent, and have received official notification to expand our operations. It is most important that we thoroughly investigate ways to increase production of oil for national use. Concerning rapeseed oil, as it has been sold from rural areas to urban markets until now, might there be methods to determine and establish projected quantities for future sales? Additionally, regarding manual pressing of cotton seeds, while we have been permitted to operate at the discretion of urban and rural areas, concerning water-powered processing of these goods, there have been previous consultations, and we propose consolidating operations at one location, with cotton seeds collected in urban areas and sent to the processing facility, while refined oil would be traded through urban intermediaries.

However, regarding rapeseed oil, in its current state, it appears that most is sold from oil merchants in Itano District to urban markets, and while the remainder could be traded in small quantities, since merchants calculate based on price fluctuations, quantities of pressed materials, and seasonal timing, it is difficult to establish reliable target numbers. We previously submitted detailed explanations of these circumstances, which remain unchanged. Concerning cotton seed water mills, if operations are consolidated in one location, this would naturally affect cotton seed sales prices. Most importantly, the small-scale operators who have managed to make a living would suffer hardship to the extent that they would face reduced income after covering miscellaneous expenses. These costs would also diminish national strength, so we respectfully request permission for water mills in locations convenient to rural areas to eliminate these miscellaneous expenses. However, the locations for water mills under governmental administration are regulated, and in the Edo territories

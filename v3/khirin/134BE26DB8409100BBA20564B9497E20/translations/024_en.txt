When deducting 1 bu and 6+ rin per kan, even at a price of 7 bu, transportation costs of 20-23% immediately amount to about 5 bu 7 rin, making transportation particularly burdensome compared to other goods.

Regarding the previously mentioned locations where water mills could be used at nearby accessible distances, if operations were conducted at each of those locations, transportation costs would be eliminated. Moreover, since small-scale merchants have limited capital, when they gather one load, they must carry and transport it themselves, which combines with the above convenience and would naturally increase seed prices. Those involved in spinning machines, small farmers of middle-class and below status who primarily lack rice fields and dry fields, as well as elderly, young, and sick people who cannot manage agricultural work, rely exclusively on hand-weaving for their daily livelihood, which they can barely maintain. Even small fluctuations in seed prices affect them significantly. The detailed breakdown of fine cloth production involves the same calculations I reported earlier. Considering the circumstances of these struggling common people, we believe it would be troublesome to have urban areas undertake monopolistic operations.

Regarding the total quantity of cotton seeds in our domain, there is no reliable estimate. If water mill operations become insufficient due to inadequate numbers, this would be pointless. Based on population surveys from the recent Year of the Rat, as shown in the separate written statement, approximately 500,000 kan appears certain. If divided among five locations, each location would handle 100,000 kan of processing. Since this is initially a trial, we humbly request your careful consideration regarding appointing too few water mill locations. If concentrated in just one location, cotton seed processing would remain incomplete, and beyond just transportation costs for unprocessed portions, market prices and conditions would decline. Nevertheless,

There have been consultations about establishing receiving operations at Reiganjima, but it would be difficult to grant unrestricted permissions, and furthermore, given the distinctions between agricultural and commercial interests, if cotton seed oil pressing were managed freely in rural areas, this might cause inconvenience to urban areas. Therefore, blanket proposals are difficult to make, and we humbly acknowledge your renewed request to submit the overall sentiments of both sides.

Regarding the government's investigative policies, in the Kantō region where oil-pressing materials are scarce, most are shipped from western provinces across distant boundaries for processing. While there may be regulations for water mill locations to be managed from Edo territories, in our domain, the purchase of pressing materials is conducted without distinction between urban and rural areas, and we believe this does not intend to hinder the lamp oil supply in urban areas.

Previously, when there were governmental regulations for manual grass pressing, water mills were established in the Sanagōchi mountains, and under the management of Takeichi Masusuke and Tōjō Seizō, they made contracts for 120,000 units of cotton seeds to be shipped to the Kansai region. Since they operated one water mill location using the cotton seeds remaining after these shipments, we believe that a single-beam water mill would be sufficient for the volume prepared for Kansai shipping.

Around the Kansei calendar period, cotton seed prices were about 7 bu per kan, but after the aforementioned investigation was completed, prices fell to 5 bu, and at times became so low that merchants would not purchase even at 4 bu. Consequently, it seems that some merchants, evading these controls, engaged in unauthorized shipping to the Kansai region. Moreover, due to the price decline, middle-grade and higher quality [cotton seeds]

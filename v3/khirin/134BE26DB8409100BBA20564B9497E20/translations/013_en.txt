Regarding the prices of cotton seeds that have been collected in small quantities in rural areas up to now, around the Kansei calendar period, they were remembered to cost about seven bu per kanme, but afterwards the market rate was four or five bu, and sometimes they were purchased for as low as four bu. This may be entirely because water-wheel pressing was contracted and controlled at one location, or it may be due to the changing times of price fluctuations. Although this matter is difficult to determine, recently with high prices for various goods, limiting operations to one location would result in lower prices and reduced profits.

Item 1: Regarding cotton seeds, if each household in rural areas sells them, generally our domain has many flat areas where agriculture is the primary occupation. Especially indigo cultivation requires much labor and effort as standing crops, and since there are not enough hands, day laborers are brought in from neighboring domains at high wages. Even women are involved in this work, and while textile work can be done in spare time, there are many poor households, widows, daughters-in-law, those without agricultural knowledge, elderly, young, and sick people, or those in mountainous areas with little farmland where livelihoods are meager. Many of these engage in textile work, selling to middle-class or higher farmers, with much being sold from the hands of common people.

Item 1: The merchants who collect cotton seeds in small quantities have little capital and cannot manage other commercial activities. They buy small amounts and send them to urban wholesalers. Since they do not have large amounts prepared or capital investment, they are occasionally burdened with miscellaneous expenses up to carrying heavy goods, which naturally results in lower prices. Due to the low prices and heavy weight, merchants with sufficient capital do not engage in small-scale collection. This is the daily livelihood of the poor.

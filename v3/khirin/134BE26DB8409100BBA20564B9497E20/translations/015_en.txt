Item 1: Regarding the Sanagochi water mill location, it is situated quite deep in the mountains. Among the various districts, there are also water mill sites conveniently located near village roads. As stated in the previous document, due to the nature of goods with low prices, heavy weight, and transportation miscellaneous expenses, there seems to be a way to raise actual prices from the water mill locations.

Attached note:
Also, the packhorse fees for transporting from the city to the Sanagochi water mill site amount to about one monme per ten kanme by gross weight. This corresponds to one bu lower per kanme, and when various circumstances are considered, since these are items of small value, they become significantly lower in proportion.
Moreover, the same packhorse fees apply when shipping oil cake from that location, and from there, shipping costs increase when selling to the three-district area. I humbly request that you also consider the costs before and after the cake processing.

Item 1: From Oe Awa to Mima by boat, the transportation costs for loading downstream to the mountain base amount to about two monme and five bu per koku of grain, averaging distance. For cotton seeds, this accumulates to six bu, two rin, and five mo per ten kan, resulting in a price difference of six bu and two rin per kan of seeds. When transported to the boat landing and then to the shore, and furthermore considering the considerable costs of transportation in the Sanagochi mountain area, if water mills are used in each district, these major expenses can be eliminated and the price of cotton seeds sold by small farmers can be raised, which would entirely foster the domain's prosperity.

Item 1: If one deprives farmers and merchants of their involvement in their respective trades, they would lose their original purpose. Therefore, I believe that merchant houses should base their operations on serving the needs of farming households throughout the domain.

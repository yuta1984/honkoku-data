Regarding the cotton seed matter, if it is drawn into the city markets, it would harm the farming households. Therefore, if you would grant permission and, considering it as domain-produced grain, order the use of water mills at convenient locations for buying, selling, and pressing, then according to what we have stated above, without incurring costs for use as fertilizer, everything would be sold out, oil production would increase, and naturally oil could be brought to the city markets for trade. Ultimately, this would lead to the prosperity of both urban and rural areas.

We have consulted together on these various matters and respectfully submit them to your attention without reservation. First and foremost, regarding domain expenses, since this would already serve as relief for the common people, we humbly request that you grant us thorough deliberation on this matter.

The above.

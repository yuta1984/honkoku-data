It is difficult to control sellers in the city from any of the rural areas, and since purchasing in the city is inconvenient, hand-pressing operations have been increased without any hindrance. The oil previously sent from rural areas to the city appears to have been mostly sold from Itano County.

The reason for this is that our domain's pressing materials are insufficient for domestic needs, so foreign seeds are shipped to the Kamigata region via sea routes called "kairo garashi" (sea route mustard), and these are intermittently loaded from sea transport. Since the wholesale prices are low, they are sold in the city at profitable rates. Regarding city affairs, since it is difficult to procure the notably illegal mustard seeds, they seek pressed oil from rural areas at their discretion. When this is not profitable, they purchase oils from Osaka, Kii Province, and other places, managing according to convenience.

Oil production is generally conducted through cash transactions without credit, so daily profits are modest. The prosperity or decline of the business depends on the price fluctuations when purchasing pressing materials. The target for this is 184 oil merchant houses in nine counties excluding Kaifu County, of which 56 are located in Itano County. Although it is called a large county, it consists only of elevated land, and the number of households is not particularly greater than other counties. There is a shortage of oil needed locally within the county, and there are many workers. About 30 of these 56 houses are located in the coastal Naruto vicinity, and we believe they send oil to the city by conveniently purchasing foreign pressing materials.

If fixed rates were established for such transactions, it would cause complications, lack flexibility, and result in poor circulation. Since purchases are made according to circumstances, it is difficult to establish fixed quotas, and even if shipping destinations were designated...

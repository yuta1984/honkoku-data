At this time, from the government authorities,
regarding matters such as oil pressers' purchasing of oil seeds and the selling and distribution methods of pressed oils,
the main regulations have been ordered, and communicated through official articles. Therefore, the portions applicable to your province
have been circulated through official notices, which you should acknowledge.

Article 1: Regarding the oil purchasing operations of Osaka oil wholesalers, within Settsu Province,
excluding the Nada area, for oils sold by water-powered and manually-operated
oil pressing establishments in Osaka, Sakai, Settsu, Kawachi, and Izumi, as well as along the Hokuriku-dō, San'in-dō, San'yō-dō,
Nankai-dō, and Saikai-dō routes, excluding Tamba Province within the San'in-dō route and
Harima Province within the Saikai-dō route, they may purchase surplus oils for daily use
that circulate from the remaining provinces. Furthermore, regarding the oil purchasing operations of Osaka oil wholesalers,
they should understand that distribution is limited to Osaka and Edo. Particularly, in Osaka,
oils are to be sold to oil intermediary merchants, and regarding Edo, since an
oil collection center has been established at Reiganjima this time, oils should be sent there
and sold to oil wholesalers and wholesale-class purchasing agents. Moreover, for domestic use in Settsu, Kawachi, Izumi provinces【two characters crossed out】
and Harima and other provinces, since they are supposed to press oils within each province to meet domestic needs,
lamp oil and colored oils need not be sold by Osaka wholesalers,
however, there are also provinces where lamp oil is insufficient or where the production methods for colored oils are difficult,
so oils may be sold to those who place orders.

Article 1: In the provinces along the Hokuriku-dō, San'in-dō, San'yō-dō, Nankai-dō, and Saikai-dō routes,

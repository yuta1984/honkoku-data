The price fluctuates depending on the accuracy of the scales used, so fixing prices would be inconvenient. If strictly determined, buyers would not travel to distant places for small quantities, which would conversely cause difficulties in sales and create problems. Regarding this matter, we would like it to be handled through direct negotiation and competitive bidding. In that case, there would be no sellers for those trying to buy at low prices, and oil pressing operators would also head to collection points, with brokers gathering where it is most convenient for them. This would naturally establish market prices, spread uniformly, and prevent inconveniences. Setting uniform market prices is the source of disputes, and it is reasonable that varied pricing would result in prices being bid up sufficiently. If things do not proceed as expected, we would like to receive your instructions at that time. We respectfully submit this matter that we have discussed for your consideration and request that you report it to higher authorities. The above.

Memorandum to be Submitted

Regarding the matter of lamp oil and the rapid implementation of hand-cultivation and hand-pressing operations,
there being public regulations, this time the aforementioned intent has been proclaimed through official notices, and orders have been issued to make it convenient for national use.
Regarding the handling of rapeseed and cotton seeds for oil operations and the convenience of commercial circulation between urban and rural areas, inquiries were made through articles, and we responded once.
Regarding the matter of cotton seeds, we have been ordered to reconsider and submit our thoughts, which we humbly acknowledge.

Item 1: Oil operations in the city are insufficient, and there have been sales arrangements from rural oil merchants up to now. Regarding cotton seed water-wheel pressing:
During the public regulation of hand-cultivation and hand-pressing, the amount of cotton seeds sent to the Kamigata region was contracted.
Considering the convenience for our domain, Takeichi Masuke and Suejō Seizō had stopped using the water wheel they employed in Sanagōchi village, and the equipment, building structures, etc. remain as they were. There would be enough for about one water-wheel operation using cotton seeds produced in our domain. Therefore, water-wheel pressing should be limited to one location in Sanagōchi.
Regarding the collection of cotton seeds, since it relates to townhouse commerce, small collectors throughout the domain should transport them to the city, bundle them together, and direct them to the aforementioned water wheel.
Regarding pressing in urban and rural areas, even if urban wholesalers purchase cotton seeds, we have been ordered to report whether there would be no troublesome issues in rural areas if operations were permitted at their discretion, which we humbly acknowledge.

Every year we procure and conduct trade from the urban markets. Most notably, since there are many oil merchants in the Muya port shipping sector, their local demand is minimal, and most of their oil is shipped and sold in urban markets. Therefore, if such orders are issued, we believe there should be no disruption to oil sales in urban markets. However, regarding white oil, we would like you to order that urban sales be conducted through individual negotiations between each store. When procurement is consolidated to a single location for buying and selling, there may be situations where prices become artificially suppressed, which we believe would naturally be difficult to implement. We respectfully submit this point for consideration. Therefore, having discussed these various matters, we submit our thoughts through this formal document. We humbly request that appropriate deliberations be ordered. The above.

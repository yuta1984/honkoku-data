Following the government's policy directive to allow each domain to operate according to their convenience and engage in extensive commercial activities, and given that cotton seeds have significantly decreased in shipments to the Kamigata region, and that besides the oil cake from Osaka and Hyogo pressing operations, the market prices of seeds in those areas have naturally risen to high levels, if there is surplus capacity in our domain's water mill operations, or if prices are inappropriately low, merchants driven by profit may secretly export these seeds, creating concerns that are difficult to calculate regarding our domain's oil production.

Although I have stated the above as previously mentioned, you might think that cotton seeds only concern rural areas. However, if the prices of these goods decline, it would cause hardship to the many people engaged in spinning who live in rented rooms and back-alley houses in the castle town - retainers and urban residents who are also poor. Since our domain does not cultivate cotton but imports it from other domains, takes it into urban areas, sells it to rural areas, and then processes it into handicrafts, it is essentially equivalent to our domain's rapeseed production - goods that pass through merchant hands once and then return to the market. If we consider this arrangement, it would also benefit those living in back-alley houses who sell goods, allowing us to abandon small commercial profits, eliminate significant expenses, strengthen our domain's power, and rescue the poor - perhaps there is a way to achieve unity between urban and rural areas. If these matters could also be subject to consultation and implementation, then without distinction between agriculture and commerce, you could firmly implement policies whereby cotton seed oil pressed in rural areas would be shipped to urban areas for commerce. This would be a method that could establish quantity estimates for each location and achieve resolution.

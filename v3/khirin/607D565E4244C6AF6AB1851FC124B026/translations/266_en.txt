Memorandum of Supplementary Report
Regarding the matter of frugality and economy within the retainer households, for the three-year period from the previous Rabbit year until this summer,
special measures were taken, and furthermore for another three-year period until the coming Dog year,
in general, as before, to ensure that there are no disrespectful and lawless persons
at ferry crossings and other places along the way, we notified all group villages without exception and were ordered to collect and
submit acknowledgment letters from each group. Humbly accepting this order, we promptly issued notifications, whereupon village officials
reported that they had respectively understood the details of the official notice, and submitted
acknowledgment letters to me personally. We have therefore promptly collected them and respectfully present them with this supplementary letter. The above.

We respectfully request that groups of three to four people be formed to work in shifts, either alternating daily or every two to three days. We believe this matter should be left to the consultation among the outcastes themselves. Regarding the arrest of inappropriate persons, while it does not work well when assigned to peasants, if the policy becomes to order the outcastes to make arrests, we believe that inappropriate persons will naturally disappear.

First, after assigning the above-mentioned guard outcastes to rotation duty, we respectfully request that village inspectors also be ordered to patrol occasionally and properly implement control measures.

However, regarding the village inspectors, not only for the hunting ground controls that go without saying, but also for the villages under their jurisdiction for uniform regulations and various investigations that have been previously ordered, we respectfully request that they be ordered to combine falcon office control duties with occasional patrols to investigate and ensure there are no inappropriate or misguided persons.

We respectfully submit the above matters that we have discussed among ourselves, humbly offering our frank opinions without reservation. The above.

Memorandum submitted:
At the locations along the river courses of the falcon hunting grounds where fishing activities are conducted, there are frequently inappropriate persons, and this is causing interference with fishing and hunting activities. If there are inappropriate and thoughtless persons at the current Tezaki hunting grounds, it would be most regrettable. Therefore, we shall strictly control such locations, and since the District Administrator also regularly inspects these locations, we are being even more careful and attentive, and ducks are gathering at the river courses and irrigation channels.

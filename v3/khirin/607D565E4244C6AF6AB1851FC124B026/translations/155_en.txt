Memorandum submitted with an accompanying letter
Regarding the matter of Urano wells in Otomeno Village, since there are no markers,
during field hunting sessions or when officials related to falconry
come to the countryside for field hunting, dangerous situations sometimes
occur. Therefore, we have been ordered to inform the owners of field wells
to erect bamboo markers and to submit name lists as well.
We humbly obey. When we immediately informed the villages in our group, separate receipt documents
expressing humble acceptance of the intent of the proclamation were submitted, so we have compiled them
and submit this with an accompanying letter. The above.

Memorandum of Supplementary Submission
Regarding the matter of Bon dancing, from the coming 14th to 16th day, following
the customary practice as it has been done until now is acceptable. However, going beyond that village to other localities
is strictly prohibited. Suddenly performing songs and dances resembling
theatrical entertainment is absolutely not to be arranged. Therefore, holding such events beyond those three days
is strictly prohibited, and should there be anyone who misunderstands these instructions,
not only that person but also the village officials will be strictly
reprimanded. We have been ordered to notify everyone individually, obtain written acknowledgments from each person,
and later submit them to the District Magistrate's office. When we notified the villages
that this was to be reverently observed, they submitted written acknowledgments stating their reverent compliance, so we have compiled them
and submit them herewith. The above.

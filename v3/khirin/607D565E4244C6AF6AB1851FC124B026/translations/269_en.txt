Report with Supplementary Letter
Article 1: Regarding the strict prohibition of the sale of poisons and similar medicinal substances
During the Kaei era,
there were official notifications from the public authorities, and furthermore, during the Tempo period, the sale of fly poison
and such matters were strictly prohibited, yet recently it has been heard that
[such activities] have become rampant. Therefore, henceforth, not only shall restrictions be enforced, but if there are
those who engage in such sales, severe punishment shall be imposed without leniency. Accordingly,
we were ordered to notify all group villages and coastal areas without omission and to collect and submit acknowledgment letters by group.
Having humbly received these orders, we immediately issued the notifications, whereupon each [village] respectfully acknowledged receipt as shown in the separate documents,
and we have collected the acknowledgment letters and respectfully present them with this supplementary letter. The above.

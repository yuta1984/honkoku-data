Memorandum of Final Acknowledgment Letter
　　To the Chief Inspector
Regarding cinnabar and cinnabar ink, beyond the cinnabar guild, brokers were appointed
to Edo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, and Sakai with posted notices, and it was announced during the Kansei era that
purchasing could be done at will from both the cinnabar guild and these brokers. However, this time the aforementioned brokers are being discontinued,
so hereafter, as before, purchases should be made directly from the guild. Naturally, cinnabar should be
purchased in small quantities from the cinnabar guild in its original packaging at the proper price, and craftsmen's
remaining
portions may be transferred to fellow craftsmen in the same packaging without issue.
However, if there are reports of trading goods of questionable origin,
severe punishment will certainly be imposed after investigation.
As stated above, this should be announced without omission to country towns in shogunal domains, private domains, and temple lands alike.
　　　April

As stated above,
since the intent of the shogunate's proclamation has been conveyed by the current official, you people
in villages and bays, regardless of who they are, must announce this to everyone without omission, and submit acknowledgment letters from each group.
This matter should be handled with utmost urgency without any delay by next month

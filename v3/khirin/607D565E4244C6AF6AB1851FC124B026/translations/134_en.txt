The matter of laxly handling control measures and the situation gradually worsening has been
heard, and as the hardships of good citizens are considerable, depending on the circumstances, nearby
magistrates' office group assistants and subordinates, or deputy officials and
clerks from deputy governor offices may also conduct raids and arrests, so within each respective
territory and fief, thorough investigation without negligence is
naturally required. When restraining in village areas or conducting rounds, first after investigation,
if reported, arrests should be made swiftly. Of course, those who flee to
other administrative territories should be pursued and
arrested mutually as decreed in the ninth year of Bunka (1812), and for both domains above and below ten thousand koku where one's own punishment is difficult to arrange,
for cases requiring coordination with other jurisdictions, following the precedent established when
directives were previously issued regarding the arrest of
vagrants and criminals, limited to this occasion:
outside the barriers, hand over to the nearest magistrate's office or deputy governor; within the
barriers, hand over to the attached officials and clerks of the Kantō control officials or to the nearest
deputy governor's camp, or depending on the case, for temple and shrine
territories to the monthly rotating temple and shrine magistrate, and for other cases to the civil affairs
accounting magistrate, accompanied by village officials—this
is acceptable. Therefore, understanding this intent, strictly as per the separate articles, limited to each village,
issue stern instructions, and post these instructions on wooden boards at the village notice board areas.

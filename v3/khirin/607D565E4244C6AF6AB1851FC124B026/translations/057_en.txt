　　　Memorandum of Report
For the skylark hawking grounds, the falconers will depart for the countryside around the 3rd day of next month on official business. Therefore, as is customary each year, wild wells should be enclosed with bamboo fencing and bamboo markers should be erected as indicators. Furthermore, these should be maintained not only at this time but permanently. Having been so ordered, please take note of this and communicate it urgently without omission to all villages in your groups, and compile and submit respective notification documents. We humbly and promptly communicated this to the villages in our group, and they reported through written documents that they had erected the markers accordingly. We have compiled these and respectfully submit them. The above.

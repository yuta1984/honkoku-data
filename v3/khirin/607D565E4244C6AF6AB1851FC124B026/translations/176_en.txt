Memorandum of Completion Report

To the Chief Inspector

Regarding the weights used for gold and silver transactions, we have heard that the money-changing guilds are using old weights from before the Kansei-era reforms. Therefore, we have repeatedly issued notices that for Kyoto, Osaka, Sakai, and nearby areas, they should not sell or buy elsewhere until melting them down, but should have them purchased by Goto Shirobyoe's office at melting prices, and that private trading of underweight old weights should cease. However, we continue to hear that in the western provinces and the Nagasaki region, old weights are still being widely traded and used. Henceforth, not only should private trading cease, but all such weights should be turned over to Shirobyoe's office without concealment. Moreover, weight inspection officials from Shirobyoe's office will make rounds, and any questionable weights will be confiscated. This directive must be strictly observed. As stated above, we have issued repeated notices since previous years, and when Goto Shirobyoe's officials made inspection rounds, we learned that questionable weights are still being used recently.

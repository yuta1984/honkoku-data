　　　Memorandum of Report
According to the purport of the shogunate's official notice, we were ordered that iron coins 
should be minted at Hakodate this time, with the characters "Hakodate Tsūhō" inscribed, to be used 
in the three places limited to Hakodate, Ezo, and Matsumae. We were ordered that it would be 
difficult to coordinate their circulation in the group villages, and were ordered to humbly comply. We submit acknowledgment documents 
accordingly, so we present them collected together. The above.

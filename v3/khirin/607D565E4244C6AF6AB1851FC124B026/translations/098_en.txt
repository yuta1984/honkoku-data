Memorandum of Completion Receipt Document
　　　To the Chief Inspector
Regarding circulating silver currency, although remelting was ordered in the previous Year of the Rooster, we have heard that circulation has been generally insufficient. Therefore, the minting of one-shu silver has been suspended, and not only the remelting of circulating silver but also increased production has been ordered. This directive should be understood accordingly.
The above directive shall be announced to all provinces.
　　　November

As stated above, this has now been ordered by the shogunate, and our current office has directed that this be announced in rural areas. Therefore, you must ensure that everyone in your group villages and coastal areas, without exception, is informed of this directive. Each group must submit one written acknowledgment by the end of next April. Furthermore, this document must be circulated to subsequent locations without delay and returned from completed villages. The above.

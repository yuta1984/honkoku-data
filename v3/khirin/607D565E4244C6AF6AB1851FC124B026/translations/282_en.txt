　　　Record of Submission Supplementary Letter
Regarding the skylark falcon hunting grounds, as the falconers have gone out to the countryside for official duties, we were instructed that the group villages should enclose the fields with well-digging bamboo, erect markers with bamboo grass respectively, and report the completed documents through group-by-group written reports. Having humbly received these orders, we immediately notified the group villages. As a result, notification documents were submitted as shown in the attached papers, so we respectfully submit this matter with a notification supplementary letter. The above.

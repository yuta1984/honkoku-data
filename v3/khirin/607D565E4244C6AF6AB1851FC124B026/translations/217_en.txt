Memorandum of Report
For the skylark falconry hunting grounds, the official falconers are
going out to the countryside on official business, so as is customary each year, the field wells
are to be individually enclosed with bamboo fencing, and bamboo markers erected as signs, as we were ordered.
We humbly accepted and immediately announced to the group villages, whereupon they respectfully accepted and
acknowledgment documents were submitted as shown in the separate document, which we have compiled and respectfully present. That is all.

Memorandum of Final Acknowledgment
　　　To the Chief Inspector
Regarding the exchange offices for old gold and silver, authentic two-bu coins, old two-shu silver, one-shu gold, etc.,
it was announced in the previous Year of the Monkey that they would be maintained until October of this Year of the Rooster, but since
there are still remaining items to be exchanged, the exchange offices will continue to be
maintained as before until October of the coming Year of the Dog. Therefore, those who possess old gold and silver and other such items must
urgently exchange them by October of the coming Year of the Dog.
1. Regarding cursive-style two-bu coins, like one-shu gold, their circulation will be stopped in due course
as was announced, and since this was previously proclaimed, those who possess them should
quickly bring them to Gotō San'emon's office as well as those in Edo, Kyoto, Osaka, and other localities who are
currently conducting exchange duties, and have them exchanged.
As stated above, so that this is thoroughly understood even in distant provinces and remote areas, in government territories the deputies, and
in private domains the domain lords and local administrators should carefully issue instructions.
　　　　　October
The above should be announced.

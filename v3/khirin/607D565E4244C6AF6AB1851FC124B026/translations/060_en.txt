　　To the Chief Inspector:
Regarding peasants and townspeople's commercial goods, borrowing travel permits from imperial family temples, aristocratic houses, and other families of high rank to conduct travel is impermissible. Furthermore, to prevent merchants' goods from being mixed with courier packages, notices have been issued repeatedly since the Shōtoku and Enkyō eras. However, in recent years there has been laxity, with commercial goods being disguised as baggage of warrior houses or imperial family temples and aristocratic houses, or peasants and townspeople claiming to be retainers of such houses when traveling, and cases of commercial goods being accepted as courier packages have occasionally been heard of. This is improper conduct. Hereafter, if such arrangements are made, after investigation, not only the person involved but also those who arranged the permits, sent notifications, and handled the transport ledgers shall be strictly punished. The above matter shall be announced.
The above.

For the purpose of skylark falconry, the falconers have gone to the countryside. As ordered, following annual custom, field wells should each be surrounded with bamboo fencing and bamboo grass markers should be erected. We humbly accepted this order and immediately communicated it to the group villages. As acknowledgment letters stating humble compliance were submitted as shown in the attached documents, we have compiled them and respectfully present them herewith. The above.

In places where there are no eta or hinin present, investigate thoroughly the places they frequent
and such locations, and for this as well, report promptly to the deputy governor for shogunal lands or to the lord or territorial administrator's
office for private domains.
Keep the above in mind. If there are any who disobey,
they shall certainly be dealt with accordingly.
As stated above.
This is an order from the current office based on the intent of the official government proclamation, so bearing this in mind,
notify everyone without exception one by one, then take signed acknowledgment documents from each group using official seals, and submit them by the 21st day.
Moreover, the proclamation documents should be returned from the villages once completed. The above.

Since the above proclamation has been issued, we have been ordered to notify everyone without exception
one by one and submit written acknowledgments, which we humbly accept.
When we promptly gave notice, they responded that they humbly accept the intent of the official proclamation,
so regarding the written acknowledgment, we village headmen submit this with our joint signatures. The above.

Memorandum of Completion Cover Letter
Regarding the matter of various protected birds, there has been a longstanding official decision, and concerning ducks which have also been protected birds until now, due to the fact that they particularly damage standing rice crops and obstruct agricultural work, permission has been granted to freely hunt and capture them in open fields hereafter. However, it has been proclaimed that we should be even more thoroughly mindful of other regulatory matters. Under the condition that we make this known to all villages under our jurisdiction without omission and compile and submit written acknowledgments, we have been so ordered. We humbly comply and promptly made this known, whereupon written acknowledgments were submitted as shown in the separate document. Therefore, we submit the above matter with this cover letter. The above.

Memorandum of accompanying document submitted
Recently, among the people of the market towns, there have been those who behave rudely and unlawfully when encountering samurai on the roads, boarding ferry boats together with them, or mistakenly boarding river boats. Additionally, 
there have been instances where eta and hinin in their travels do not properly separate themselves from townspeople and farmers as required. Although there have been repeated official notices about this matter, the situation has become particularly problematic,
so once again this time, through an official directive, we have been ordered to thoroughly investigate this matter.
We have been commanded to instruct the village officials under our jurisdiction to ensure there are no those who misunderstand proper conduct, and to announce this without exception to all farmers
as well as eta and hinin, requiring them to submit written acknowledgments.
We humbly accept this order. Having immediately communicated this to all villages under our jurisdiction,
they have submitted written acknowledgments expressing their humble acceptance as shown in the separate documents, which
we hereby present together. The above.

　　　Report
For the skylark falconry hunting grounds, the falconers will be departing to the countryside in the coming days for official duties. As is customary each year, bamboo enclosures should be constructed around the field wells, and bamboo grass should be erected. We were ordered to report when these preparations are completed. We humbly accepted this order and immediately communicated it to the group villages, whereupon they submitted acknowledgment letters as shown in the separate document expressing their humble acceptance. We respectfully submit these collected documents. The above.

As stated above, there has now been an official proclamation from the shogunate, and I have been ordered to notify all villages under my group and have each group submit a written acknowledgment on one sheet. I humbly acknowledge this and have immediately issued the notifications. As the villages have submitted written acknowledgments stating they comply with the intent of the official proclamation, I hereby endorse and submit these. The above.

Memorandum of Accompanying Report
Inoue Kumasaburo, a retainer of Lord Inada Kurobyoe who resides in Wakimachi, Mima County,
has escaped from detention at the magistrate's office.
Therefore, we were ordered to conduct thorough investigations of people using his personal description throughout the group villages, shrine grounds, forests, reed fields
and other areas. We humbly accepted and
immediately announced to the group villages and conducted investigations, whereupon we found that no such
person was spotted, and submitted written reports as shown in the separate document.
We respectfully present this with an accompanying letter.

I humbly believe this to be so, therefore I record this matter here.
　　This was an edict from the 19th day of the 9th month of the Ox year. I remember that it should be
　　submitted around October. However, it seems that the written acknowledgment from Fuchu village
　　was misplaced, as one copy remains in my possession.

　　　　　Regarding the completion of written acknowledgments
　　To the Chief Inspector
This time, for circulation in society, one-shu silver coins are to be minted using high-quality nanryō silver,
so sixteen of these one-shu silver coins shall be equivalent to one ryō of gold. Moreover, both silver and copper coins should be
exchanged at the same rate as one-bu silver coins and put into circulation. Regarding these nanryō one-shu silver coins,
since they are ordered to circulate in the same manner as gold, they should circulate without delay. The
deadline for circulation and other matters will be announced later. This directive should also be made known to all domains.
　　　December
This should be announced as stated above.
As stated above,
This is an official government edict, so understanding this, all members of your associated villages and coastal areas should urgently
spread the word, and submit written acknowledgments by group divisions by the 10th day of next month. Furthermore, this notice
requires urgent attention, so it should be circulated with this and returned from the villages once completed. The above.

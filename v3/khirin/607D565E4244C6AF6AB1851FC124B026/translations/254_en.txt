4th day, 4th month, year of the Dragon
Regarding domestically produced umbrellas, since the trial production at the Paper Office 
in the previous year of the Boar, the craftsmen have worked diligently to complete them quickly, 
producing quality goods at affordable prices. Therefore, domestic umbrellas will now be 
designated as official storehouse goods. Consequently, using even one umbrella will 
help support the livelihood of those involved in their production, and moreover, money will not 
flow out to other domains, creating better circulation within our own domain. Therefore, in the urban areas 
as well as Muya Shikenyamachi and Tomioka-machi, direct purchasing of umbrellas from other domains 
is hereby prohibited by official order. Although other areas 
are not expected to make direct purchases anyway, to ensure there are no misunderstandings, 
this matter shall be handled in the same manner as the trial production since the year of the Boar, 
so this notice shall be disseminated throughout the entire domain.
　However, umbrellas from other domains that have already been purchased in urban and rural areas 
　must be reported to the Paper Office regarding their quantities. The above.

As this official notice has been issued, we were ordered to notify the villages and submit 
acknowledgment documents expressing our compliance. We humbly complied and notified each area. 
As they responded that they humbly accept the intent of the official notice, we jointly signed

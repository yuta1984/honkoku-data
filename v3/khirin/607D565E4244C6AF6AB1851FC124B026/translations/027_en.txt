When it comes to attending and maintaining the hunting grounds, we shall serve by implementing even stricter controls and ensuring everything is convenient for your purposes. We deeply appreciate that you have repeatedly emphasized and instructed us on this matter. Therefore, regarding future control measures, we respectfully submit the following proposals that we have discussed among ourselves:

First, concerning the falcon hunting grounds and all restricted hunting areas in the villages: we have previously instructed the village officials to assign bird guards with identification tags to patrol within the villages daily from around the 8th and 9th months until March of the following year, implementing controls to prevent inappropriate persons. Furthermore, while the Falcon Office has ordered investigations of the pastures using lower bird inspectors, and strict controls have been ordered for village and coastal areas where hunting grounds are located, for future matters we shall instruct the officials of the restricted hunting villages to have an even better understanding of control measures. Of course, villages with hunting grounds should have their officials be especially vigilant, with bird guards patrolling daily without negligence to maintain control. However, since the bird guards patrol the villages with identification tags, inappropriate persons may calculate the gaps in patrol coverage. Therefore, we respectfully request that two or three assistant guards from nearby villages be assigned to support each village's guard, patrolling daily and arresting any inappropriate persons they encounter.

However, since these are impoverished outcastes, if this duty is assigned to the village guards, it will interfere with their other official duties and their livelihood, causing various hardships.

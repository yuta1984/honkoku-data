Regarding the matter of driving away cranes and wild geese, for which investigation has been ordered for some time, since everyone has been conducting themselves properly this winter, permission has been granted to drive them away after Setsubun. However, we were ordered to carefully inform even the small farmers not to become lax in spirit and engage in improper driving methods using various tools. We humbly accepted this directive and communicated it to the group villages, whereupon they submitted acknowledgment letters expressing their gratitude and humble acceptance. Therefore, we respectfully submit our acknowledgment letter for this matter. The above.

As the Young Lord may soon engage in deer hunting, we require the names and ages of those skilled in hunting in the southern and northern mountain districts for official use. We were ordered to investigate all villages under our jurisdiction without omission, compile this into registers, and submit them organized by group. We humbly complied and promptly made this known, whereupon reports came in that there were no persons engaged in hunting. Therefore, we report the above matter in writing. The above.

Regarding the above written report, since there were no instructions stating that it should be submitted regardless of whether or not [such persons existed], we do not submit it.

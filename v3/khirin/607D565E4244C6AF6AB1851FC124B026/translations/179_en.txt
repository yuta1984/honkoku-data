Regarding riding horses on advance patrol routes with long ropes, although proper conduct has been repeatedly proclaimed from previous years, it has become disorderly. Therefore, regulations were established and ordered from the previous Boar year, but there are still those who misunderstand. Also, regarding parasols, their use has been prohibited except for monks, nuns, clergy, women, and children. However, recently it appears that men among the lower classes have been using oiled paper parasols. We have repeatedly issued notices to strictly prohibit this from some time ago, but we hear there are still those who misunderstand, which is particularly improper. We have been ordered to strictly prohibit such improper behavior in the future, which we humbly obey. When we promptly notified the organized villages, receipt documents stating humble compliance were submitted, so we respectfully present them. The above.

Written acknowledgment regarding the shogunate's edict on oil cargo regulations
　　　Respectfully submitted in the 5th month of the Ox year. That is all.

　　　Memorandum of completed written acknowledgment
Regarding dancing during the Bon festival, from the coming 14th to 16th day, it may be performed as
customary. However, going out to other districts beyond that village is strictly prohibited,
and performances called "niwaka" that resemble the style of kabuki actors are absolutely
forbidden to be arranged. Holding such events beyond these three days is strictly prohibited,
so as this has been recorded in the written acknowledgment records, we note this matter and submit it promptly.

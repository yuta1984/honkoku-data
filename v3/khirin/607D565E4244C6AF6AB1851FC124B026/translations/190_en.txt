Memorandum of completed acknowledgment letter
To the Great Inspector

Regarding the burning of the Great Pagoda at Mount Kōya, the government has expectations of donations, and from this current Monkey year until the coming Dog year, for a period of three years, collection and solicitation activities have been ordered throughout the various provinces. Accordingly, within the government territory, warrior households of ten thousand koku and above as well as below, and also town residents and others in both government and private domains, those with the inclination should make donations regardless of the amount. However, temples of the Orthodox Shingon sect are to be excluded since Mount Kōya will directly communicate with and collect from them. For the remainder, government lands with magistrates should go through those magistrates, areas under their jurisdiction should go through their administrators, private domains should go through domain lords and land stewards, and temple and shrine lands should similarly go through their respective administrators or land stewards for collection. The donations collected should be submitted to Kuze Izumo-no-kami by the eleventh month of the coming Dog year, as communicated in the seventh month of last Monkey year. However, donations collected hereafter should be submitted to Wakisaka Awaji-no-kami. The above.

　　　Rooster year, second month

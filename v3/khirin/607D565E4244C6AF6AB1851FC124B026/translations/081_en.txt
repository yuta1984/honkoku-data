Regarding this year, rice, wheat, and other crops appear to have had reasonable yields, and compared to last year, prices have greatly eased, and the general mood has become calm. However, as the Bon festival approaches, we hear that dancing or improvised performances are being planned. While traditional practices are generally acceptable,ササ踊り (bamboo grass dancing) and similar improper improvised performances or fixed-stage entertainments, which have been strictly prohibited and investigated previously, absolutely must not be arranged.

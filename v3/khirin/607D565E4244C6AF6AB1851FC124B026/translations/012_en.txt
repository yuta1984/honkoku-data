We have heard that [old weights] are being used among money exchange guilds, so regarding those from Kyoto, Osaka, Sakai, and Omi,
even damaged ones should not be sold elsewhere, but should be
purchased by Goto Shirōbei's office at damaged goods prices,
and light old weights should not be bought and sold privately. This has been
proclaimed repeatedly, but we still hear that in the western provinces and along the Nagasaki routes, many old weights are being
bought, sold, and used. Hereafter, regarding private buying and selling,
of course nothing should be concealed, and [such weights] should be handed over to Shirōbei's office. Moreover, inspection officials from Shirōbei's office will
make rounds, and suspicious weights are to be confiscated according to the regulations. This directive must be
strictly observed. As stated above, this has been proclaimed repeatedly since previous years, and Goto Shirōbei's
officials have made inspection rounds, but recently we have heard that suspicious weights are also being used,
so this time inspection officials from Shirōbei's office will make rounds, and suspicious
weights are to be confiscated, so this directive must be strictly observed.
As stated above, for shogunal lands the deputy officials, and for private domains the lords and land stewards should make the proclamation. The above.
　　　Rabbit 6th month [June 1831]
As stated above,
there has been an official bakufu proclamation, so regardless of who in the village groups, [the directive] should be communicated to each one,
and a receipt document for each village group should be submitted. This document should be circulated to successive [villages] without delay
and returned from the completed villages. The above.
　　　　　　　　　　For this honorable receipt document,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　[we] respectfully exclude [ourselves].

Memorandum of Supplementary Report

Regarding various craftsmen's wages, employment wages, servant stipends, as well as village and coastal area food stalls and matters of frugal conduct, we were instructed last year in the 11th month of the Horse Year to investigate and settle these matters, which we humbly acknowledged and submitted acceptance documents for. Furthermore, this time we have been instructed that based on the true intent of the aforementioned directive, there should be no inappropriate customs, which we each humbly acknowledge. When we immediately notified the group villages, they responded that they would gratefully comply with and observe the directive as intended. Since the officials have submitted acceptance documents as shown in the attached separate paper, we have compiled them and respectfully submit this with a supplementary letter. The above.

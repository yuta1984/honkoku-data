Regarding the Bon dance to be held from the upcoming 14th to 16th day, there is no objection. However, it is limited to that village/coastal area only, and going to other localities is strictly prohibited. Furthermore, dressing like dancing girls is absolutely forbidden. Moreover, holding such events beyond those three days is also strictly prohibited, so you must ensure there are no violations of these rules. Having given these instructions, if there are any violators, not only those individuals but even the village officials will be subject to punishment. Therefore, announce this directive without fail to all your group villages and coastal areas, keep the written acknowledgments at your location, and submit them to the district magistrate's office later. Also, this document must be circulated to subsequent locations without any delay and returned from completed villages. The above.

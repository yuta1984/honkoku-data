Memorandum of completed written acknowledgment
It is heard that cockfighting has become popular in various places at the foot of the sacred mountain, with some people becoming particularly absorbed in it.
In the end, when this spreads, not only do people neglect agriculture first and foremost, but
they also get carried away momentarily and spend money on buying and selling roosters, which is problematic.
Therefore, cockfighting competitions are strictly prohibited. You must ensure that all villages and coastal settlements in your group
are informed without exception, and if anyone disobeys, punishment will be administered.
With this understanding, gather the group's written acknowledgments and submit them to the district magistrate's office
by the 20th of this month. That is all.
　　　　　9th day of the 2nd month, Ox year
　　Written acknowledgments as stated above have been submitted from the villages, so we respectfully submit them
　　The accompanying document is as follows

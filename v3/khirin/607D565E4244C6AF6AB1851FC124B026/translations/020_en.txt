To the Chief Inspector:
Regarding haifuki silver and other types of crushed silver, these shall be sold to the ginza (silver guild) and authorized buyers,
and those who need silver implements and base silver shall purchase them at the ginza and
shall not engage in buying and selling elsewhere. This was proclaimed previously, but it has been
heard that there are those who trade indiscriminately,
which is improper. As proclaimed previously, this must be strictly observed:
buying and selling shall not be conducted anywhere other than at the ginza and with authorized buyers.
Article 1: Regarding silver leaf, stock certificates and base silver for foil are distributed from the ginza,
and craftsmen in Kyoto beat it into leaf and sell it to the public. However, it has been heard that in other provinces there are those who
make silver leaf using dubious base silver. Since it is
difficult for anyone other than the licensed foil craftsmen of Kyoto
to make silver leaf elsewhere, this shall be absolutely prohibited.
The above directive has been proclaimed repeatedly since previous years, but recently it has again
become lax, especially in the northern provinces, and it has been heard that in other provinces as well, silver leaf is being
secretly manufactured, which is improper. Henceforth, this must be strictly observed: haifuki silver
and other types of crushed silver shall strictly not be bought and sold except at the ginza,
and regarding silver leaf as well, no manufacturing shall be conducted
anywhere other than by the licensed craftsmen of Kyoto. If haifuki silver and other crushed silver types [are traded outside] the ginza

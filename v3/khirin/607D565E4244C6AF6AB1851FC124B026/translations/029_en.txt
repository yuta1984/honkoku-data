This time, nishu step-stamped gold coins have been ordered to be minted for circulation in society.

They should be accepted and circulated without delay in the same manner as the previous nishu silver coins. This directive shall also be announced to all provinces.

As there has been the above directive from the Shogunate, regardless of which village groups, this must be communicated to each individual person, and receipt confirmations must be submitted on individual sheets of paper. This notice must be circulated to subsequent locations without delay, and returned from completed villages. The above.

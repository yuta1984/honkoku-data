Regarding the exchange of koban (small gold coins) and one-bu coins, even if the replacement koban are all one-bu coins,
they shall be exchanged at the ratio of seven parts koban to three parts one-bu coins,
so from the fifteenth day of the eleventh month, submit them to the persons listed separately for exchange.

1. Regarding samurai and others instructing townspeople through direct negotiation to submit coins to the aforementioned persons
for exchange, this shall be at their discretion.

1. Since the number of koban and one-bu coins to be submitted for exchange is known,
do not hoard them but submit them for exchange progressively. If anyone is found to be hoarding without exchanging,
they will be strictly dealt with after investigation.

The above shall be proclaimed.

Regarding the matter of the falcon hunting grounds: Every year, orders are received from the Falcon Office through the lower bird observers to strictly control the villages and coastal areas where the hunting grounds are located. We have been implementing these controls by conducting rounds with identification tags. However, based on the instructions given today, we shall summon the village and coastal officials and strictly arrange for the implementation of controls day and night without negligence. We shall investigate in detail the hunting grounds currently in use for falconry activities, areas receiving maintenance, and previously discontinued hunting grounds, and report with maps. We shall also humbly present our thoughts regarding the arrangements for each of these locations. Therefore, as representatives of the entire district, we respectfully submit the above.

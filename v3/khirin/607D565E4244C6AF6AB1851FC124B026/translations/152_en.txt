If a person matching the above description is found, detain them at that location. For shogunal lands, report to the deputy magistrate; for private domains, report to the domain lord or local administrator, and then report to Nabeshima Takuminokami's guard station in Edo. If you see or hear anything about such a person, you must also report that. Of course, retainers and servants must also be thoroughly investigated. If anyone conceals information and it becomes known from other sources, it will be considered a serious offense.

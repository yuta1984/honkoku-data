Regarding the matter of granting saiban (official permits) to the aforementioned individuals, we have reviewed the written application that the Products Office (bussan-kata) has taken responsibility for and submitted. Accordingly, we will first order them to conduct this as a trial for two to three years. However, the benefit silver (goeki-gin) will not be collected at this time, so they should conduct sales at sufficiently low prices. If this is carried out successfully, they should submit another application at that time, as we have instructed them. The purport of this matter shall also be communicated to the town magistrate (machi-bugyō) and county magistrate (gunday), and this understanding should be conveyed to the principal merchants (moto-iri-chū).

Kii-ya Tokubei of Daiku-machi 2-chome and Jihei, a person without official role from Sako Village, have used tree lacquer (ki-urushi) produced within your domain to manufacture wax finishes, Shunkei lacquerware, vermillion blends, and various other colored lacquers. As these have been completed excellently as shown in the diagram above, we humbly request that we be granted permission for the manufacturing methods and sales operations. In that case, we will offer two monme of profit silver per one kan of tree lacquer application. As for lacquer seeds, we are already conducting specialized trading operations similar to those for sumac wax, so we request that lacquer operations also be consolidated under the supervision of the Products Office. As stated in our application, if this is approved, we request that the persons listed below be granted permits, and the Products Office has reviewed the written application for taking charge of this matter. Therefore, as a trial, we will conduct operations for two to three years, and since the profit silver portion will not be collected at this time, we will conduct sales at quite reasonable prices. If operations proceed very well, we will report again at that time, as we have been instructed regarding this matter.

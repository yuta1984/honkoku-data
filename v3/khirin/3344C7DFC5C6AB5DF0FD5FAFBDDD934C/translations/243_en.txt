Regarding the matter of the three-and-a-half-bu levy
　Notice from the chief administrators
○【Red ink mark】
Seventy-three　　Memorandum
Due to financial difficulties in the treasury, it was ordered that a three-and-a-half-bu levy be
collected until the coming year of the Dog. However, given the current circumstances,
there has been deep consideration of the matter, and with special consideration,
it has been ordered that the levy be exempted from this summer. Nevertheless, given the dire
financial situation, the levy may be imposed again in the future.
Therefore, everyone should practice unified frugality, maintain military preparedness without negligence, and
continue their duties perpetually. This directive should be communicated throughout the retainer band,
and should also be conveyed to those under your command. Furthermore, care should be taken that
the various parties contacted last year are not overlooked, and each should be properly informed. The above.
　　However, regarding this order, the 50% increase on the bu-ichi tax and other tribute
　　items will continue to be collected as before, so this point should also be
　　communicated.

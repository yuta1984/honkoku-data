Regarding tax matters and such, inappropriate petitions and mistaken matters should not be submitted, and [such affairs] should be handled appropriately with utmost care. This also should be thoroughly communicated.

The above should be communicated to the officials of each group and village, and the village officials should thoroughly communicate this to the peasants without omission.

　　　　己 [tsuchinoto] November 19th

First, regarding this occasion's directive, the group leaders and village headmen, as well as village officials, must properly understand it, otherwise it will be difficult to properly communicate to the small peasants. Therefore, they should naturally understand this easily. If so, the generous mercy would become thin, which would be cause for great concern.

First, regarding rice price tags and such, while it appears they are trending toward an increase of 140-150 monme per standard unit, since the recent decline, there has been no significant increase this year. Compared to other provinces, the peasants should be able to manage their annual tax payments with ease. Moreover, if the merciful directive of this occasion is to be implemented, the collection of tax payments should be handled even more appropriately, and this should be thoroughly communicated.

First, in village areas where there are frequent replacements of officials due to poor management, [taxes] should be allocated proportionally according to their assessed value. Although we speak of proportional allocation, the special directive should be thoroughly understood, and efforts should be made to achieve complete payment as much as possible.

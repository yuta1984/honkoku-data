○【Red seal】
Regarding the above, concerning the honorable intentions that have been proclaimed this time, today we were summoned and given the written directive, and ordered to return to our village and promptly convey [these instructions] earnestly to all the people of the village. We humbly accept this with reverence. We in the rural areas have already been hearing reports about the poor harvests in the Kanto and northern regions, as well as rumors of trade restrictions in various provinces, and have been mindful of the importance of conserving rice. At such a time, with these generous benevolent proclamations being issued and explained to the common people, we all feel extremely blessed and grateful, and believe we should diligently practice rice conservation in accordance with these honorable intentions. We also consider ourselves most fortunate. Therefore, we respectfully submit this written acknowledgment with joint signatures. The above.

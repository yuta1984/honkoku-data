There appear to be many who engage in activities that lead day laborers and servants into misconduct. Village and port officials must thoroughly investigate such cases.

1. Regarding frugality

Recently, people have generally become fond of luxury and ostentation. Those who have lived comfortably for many years disregard expenses for clothing and food, engage in excessive practices in their business dealings, and in all matters seem to prioritize reputation above all else. Naturally, today's way of living has become expensive, and although people understand these matters, the customs have become difficult to regulate. Among them, there are many who, despite experiencing hardship and difficulty, prioritize maintaining appearances. Since prominent people are involved in such practices, even common people of lower status strive to reach the same level, but there are those who cannot manage adequately no matter how much they work or produce. From such circumstances, many people have come to occasionally lack sincerity in various tax payments, business transactions, and expenditures. This ultimately stems from the lack of frugality in all matters.

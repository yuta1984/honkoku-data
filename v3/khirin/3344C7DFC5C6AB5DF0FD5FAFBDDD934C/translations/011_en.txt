Regarding rural shops, investigations have been ordered repeatedly since previous years, and particularly in Kyōwa 2 (1802) strict investigations were conducted. However, in recent years things have become lax, and it has been determined that there are those who engage in direct purchasing from the Kamigata region. Moreover, merchants from the cities have also entered to engage in selling and buying, handling items other than those previously permitted, which has become the foundation for farmer arrogance and is a problematic matter.
Therefore, henceforth strict investigations shall be conducted, and not only direct purchasers but also city merchants engaging in selling and buying shall be prohibited. Although trade using city procurement is permitted for items listed in the separate document circulated during the Hōreki years, [we must confirm] whether this causes no hindrance to daily necessities.
If there are other necessary items beyond those mentioned above, these should also be discussed and proposals submitted.
　However, even among items listed in the separate document, if there are goods that can be adequately procured from the cities, these should be excluded.

The aforementioned written report was submitted on the 27th day of the 11th month. That same night around the hour of the Rat (10 PM), we were summoned to the office and went to the Nanto-ya regional administration office. There, regarding the previously mentioned petition, the deliberations and administrative measures by the responsible district magistrate had been satisfactorily completed. Therefore, each person should return to their village and thoroughly convey the meaning of the instruction document so that its intent would not be lost. Particularly, since there are village areas that have fully paid their taxes (ayegakari), for such cases, if the actual situation allows the farmers to manage without financial distress, they should report the amounts eligible for deferment. In such cases, deferment until next spring would be granted through official directive. Since Hozumi [family name] was absent, Tani Kuninoshin, who was in charge, was supposed to issue direct orders, but due to urgent business requiring his immediate attention, from this day forward, we were instructed to work diligently at our posts, convey these instructions, and return to our villages. Abe Taketaro informed us that this directive should also be promptly communicated to colleagues who were not present.

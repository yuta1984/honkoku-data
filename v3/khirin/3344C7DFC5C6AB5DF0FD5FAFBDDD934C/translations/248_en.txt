Seventy-six　　Copy of current official memorandum
Regarding the export volumes of domestic products that have been shipped from the northern and southern districts to other provinces up to now, as well as current prices, these are needed for official purposes. Therefore, thoroughly inquire about these items and compile accurate figures by district to be reported within the eighth month.
　　However, regarding consultation: Concerning domestic products for export, in this district there are only two items—indigo balls and salt—beyond which there are none. Salt production is limited to coastal areas, and in areas like the organized groups there are only indigo balls. For the quantities of these balls exported, summon the ball craftsmen from each village to determine the number of bales and quantities produced from their homes, as well as the quantities purchased and arranged by urban wholesalers and shipped to market venues, compiling these as "so many hundreds and tens of bales." Regarding prices, for indigo balls, although we speak of recent market rates, they are classified as upper, middle, and lower grades with prices stated as "so many hundreds and tens of copper coins," but since no firm prices are established, it has been decided through consultation that from last year's new opening prices to the present, top-quality goods should be priced at a certain percentage higher, with middle and lower quality goods handled in the same manner.

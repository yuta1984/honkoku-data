This was reported to village headman and village chief Tamura Yasutaro of Nakata Village group, and Tsuruha Tomojiro of the same position in Nakago Village - this is an application for contribution. The question is whether, as requested, this should be contributed and added to the gruel rice for Komatsu Island Bay, and whether a complete accounting ledger should be submitted later.

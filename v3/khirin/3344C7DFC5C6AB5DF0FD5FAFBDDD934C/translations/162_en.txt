Notice to Village Heads and Headmen
○ [Written in red] Sixty-seven

Regarding the wind and rain on the first day of last month, reports have reached Edo and come to His Lordship's attention. Accordingly, concerning those who have fallen into particular hardship due to the aforementioned wind and rain, conduct a sincere investigation without distinction between close and distant relations, compile this into village group registers, and submit them promptly.

However, regarding the matter in this document, not only for those in hardship but also ensure that nothing leaks out to anyone other than village officials, and conduct the investigation with this in mind when reporting. Furthermore, for matters so unprecedented that there are no similar cases, consult with fellow officials throughout the district and report the actual situation as it is. If there are no such village areas, report that fact as well.

Snake year, eighth month, eleventh day

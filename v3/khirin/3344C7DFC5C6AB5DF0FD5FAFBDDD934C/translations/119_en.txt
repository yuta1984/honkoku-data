Regarding people from other domains without travel permits and suspicious persons, including those making pilgrimages to the four provinces of Shikoku, although we have repeatedly ordered investigations and control measures, it appears that such people continue to infiltrate the border areas. Therefore, last June we conducted investigations and ordered their expulsion, which resulted in a temporary decrease. However, recently it appears that such people are again infiltrating the border areas. This seems to indicate that our surveillance has become lax, which is problematic. Accordingly, we are once again ordering strict investigations. Keep the previous directives firmly in mind, and on the coming 11th day, at an auspicious time in the villages and harbors, conduct thorough investigations with accompanying officials, expel them at the nearest domain borders, record their home provinces, locations, and names in registers, and submit these to the district magistrate's office. Furthermore, regarding future matters, officials must be especially mindful to ensure that surveillance does not become negligent.

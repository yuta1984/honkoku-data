The prices have become high, and since the levy percentages (buogake) will be collected this winter, even just the portion that becomes different grades of rice amounts to over ten thousand koku, which naturally leads to high market prices. If left as is, not only those responsible for tax payments but even the small farmers will fall into hardship. Therefore, we request the following measures be implemented. If so, the current anxious situation would be alleviated and naturally stabilize - such detailed reports having been submitted, we have reviewed them. Given that rice prices this year are exceptionally high, and if market prices continue to rise, the common people will face severe hardship. Therefore, for this occasion only, we approve the use of Awaji rice for tax payments as written below, and we acknowledge the various arrangements as reported. Please announce this matter, and also inform the Granary Magistrate, New Granary Magistrate, and North Granary Magistrate of these details. As for the Sumoto matter, we will send word to Terazawa Shikibu. The head administrators convey that this should be understood accordingly.

1. Regarding the shipments from stipend holders residing in Sumoto that were previously arranged for transport: upon investigation, three thousand koku were shipped and entered into both granaries in the recent Year of the Ox, so for this current matter, we request that two thousand koku be designated promptly at this time.

1. Regarding the Awaji rice shipped to local stipend holders here, please ensure that tax payments to the New Granary and North Granary will not be hindered.

That is all.

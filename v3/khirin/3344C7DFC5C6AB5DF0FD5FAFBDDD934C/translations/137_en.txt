Regarding unavoidable construction projects and expenses for ceremonial occasions (both auspicious and inauspicious), each person should conduct themselves as frugally as possible regardless of other circumstances, ensuring there are no wasteful expenditures whatsoever. They should steadfastly continue their loyal service, prioritize military preparedness above all, and thoroughly understand the need to diligently perform their duties.

This matter should be communicated to all retainer households through each respective authority. For unranked lower-ranking individuals, their respective supervisors should relay these instructions. For townspeople and rural residents, the town magistrates and district administrators should convey the intent of these orders, and consideration should be given to informing other appropriate channels as well. The above.

However, since these orders are being issued as stated in the main text, regarding the tax remission amounts for this winter, portions collected as regular rice shall continue to be submitted as usual. At the North Warehouse, distributions shall be made according to Edo market prices for high-value goods under domain control, so this should be understood accordingly. Of course, for those going to serve in Edo, they will be sent later, and the same tax remissions as stated in the main text will be granted for the winter season, so this should be understood. The above.

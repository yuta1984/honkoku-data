Regarding fire prevention, although we have previously established rules and given instructions, and everyone is aware of them, as we are entering the season of increasingly harsh cold winds, each person should naturally have their entire family pay attention to their own residence. However, depending on the number of neighboring houses, they should consult and form groups of three to four houses, or five to six houses. Even during daylight hours, when engaged in farming or when the head of household is away, they should arrange to rely on members of these groups and should pay attention to each other with sincere intent. This principle should be thoroughly and earnestly communicated without exception to everyone in the village, from the village headmen to the smaller farmers.

However, even if groups are organized as stated in the main text, having one person from each household join together in groups of five or six people to patrol while shouting "fire prevention" loudly is merely perfunctory and ultimately loses the true intent. This could lead to situations where people gather and carelessly handle fire, which would actually cause harm. Therefore, such superficial arrangements should be avoided, and it is essential to focus solely on paying attention to each other with sincere intent.

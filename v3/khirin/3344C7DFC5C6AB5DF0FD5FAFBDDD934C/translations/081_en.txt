Since this is the season of wild mating, the wheat ears are gradually approaching the time when they become pregnant with grain, but if they are eaten and damaged by various birds, the farmers will be troubled. Therefore, from today, permission has been granted to drive away various birds. However, 
when going out to villages for
falconry, regarding those
routes, written notices will be issued, so
in villages through which you pass, bird driving should be suspended all day. Naturally, regarding river
sandbar ducks,
during falconry sessions, driving birds from nearby farmland is acceptable, so
gratefully understanding this intent, each of you should
convey and inform the village group and coastal officials,
and submit written acknowledgments by village group within this month. The above

　　Boar year, first month, twenty-sixth day
　　　　　　　To the group leaders and village headmen of both Myōdō and Myōsai counties
　The above matter to be reported to Abe and Yuasa

Attached note:
Regarding the assistant clerk roles in the main text, these were served by three ground-based head clerks, but around the Tenpō era, the dismissal of these three was ordered, and it was decreed that five successor officials would serve in rotation together. Therefore, the silver grant for one head clerk is not received as a blessing, and we serve receiving payment for two head clerks.

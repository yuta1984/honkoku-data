○【Written in red】　Copy of the directive issued again on the 13th day of the first month of the Year of the Rabbit

1. Regarding Shikoku pilgrims entering from various border points, entry permits shall specify a limit of fifteen days, and village heads and headmen shall communicate this to the guard stations.

1. Matters concerning Kada ships shall be investigated at the government office, which will issue instructions.

1. In the town center and Oyamashita village bay area, pilgrimage gratitude tags shall not be distributed.
　　However, for various districts, gratitude tags shall be limited by district boundaries and shall not extend to other districts, to be investigated accordingly.

1. Regarding the handling of village firearms, when there are fathers and sons, the eldest son shall serve as substitute for the village inspector as requested. Of course, for those without an eldest son, there is no problem if the person himself handles them according to the group's policies.

1. Regarding gambling investigations, follow the oral instructions given.
　【Pasted note】Regarding these oral instructions, the intention is that arresting people from various places all at once and bringing them to the government office would make it difficult to obtain understanding, so village heads and headmen should gradually gain understanding with this in mind. At this time, most of those who should be concerned about gambling are amateurs without status, and there will likely be many people involved. By the second or third month, attention should be paid to those of higher status and professional gamblers, as instructed with this meaning.

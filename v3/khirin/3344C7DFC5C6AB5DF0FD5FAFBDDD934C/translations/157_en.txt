We will make inquiries with the domain lords and land stewards, so please
write out the details ensuring there are absolutely no errors.
If there are discrepancies, it will be considered a fault.
Item: We hear that there are occasionally sake brewers without licenses or permits.
This is extremely improper conduct, but we have also ordered thorough investigation

improper dealings, you must definitely report it from your end. The oral instruction

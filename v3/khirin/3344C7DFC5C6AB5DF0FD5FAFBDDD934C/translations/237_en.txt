Memorandum respectfully submitted

Regarding the matter of hunting suspicious persons for which we have received detailed instructions, you have directed that seven people be formed into one group - one dōshin officer, two gesaihan, two ban-hinin【two rural inspectors, omitted】- with three points to the north and two points to the south. Concerning the villages outside of Oyamashita, as shown in the separate document, rural inspectors patrol and record their assigned areas, which we have submitted. Of course, due to the convenience of the investigation department, we do not yet know which village will be visited on which day, but according to the sequential investigation pattern, the general schedule of which village on which day should be communicated from the dispatched officials to the village headmen of those villages. Otherwise, we believe the extent of interference would be difficult to calculate. Furthermore, regarding the rural inspectors, depending on the convenience of their patrol rounds, we believe it would be more convenient if the dispatched officials communicate directly with them. Therefore, we have consulted among ourselves and respectfully submit this without reservation, so please present this matter appropriately. The above.

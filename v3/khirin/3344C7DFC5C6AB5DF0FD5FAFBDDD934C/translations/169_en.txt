Instruction and explanation document to be conveyed to the yorito (village representatives) and village headmen

Regarding the matter of the current Tezaki, this is a location taken over from the government mountain base, and it is exceptionally busy. Therefore, various disputes and port designations may cause inconvenience to the common people. After considering the procedural methods, the insertion of the Tezaki transfer name list this past August has made matters even more complicated. Already, the petitions since August amount to one hundred documents in just one month. Consequently, the extraordinary official duties that follow in sequence have become numerous, and although we have ordered the clerks to work early shifts and have been conducting frequent investigations, there are no remaining days within this year to handle the procedures at the government office. Similarly, regarding the dispute matters to be handed over to you, although most arrangements have been completed, it appears the situation will proceed as before, likely causing inconvenience to the common people. Therefore, we have repeatedly adjusted the procedural methods, but since the clerks are few in number for this territory and official duties have been exceptionally busy recently, it will be difficult to quickly investigate the accumulated dispute cases even when spring arrives.

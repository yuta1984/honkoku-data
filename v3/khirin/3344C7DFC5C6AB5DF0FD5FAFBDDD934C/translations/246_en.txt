　　　　　Copy of official directive
Regarding rice purchasing locations outside of rice field allocations in the seven northern districts, for this winter's annual tax, a loan of twenty me of silver per koku of rice has been ordered. If repayment is ordered to be made in ten installments over five years, we would be most grateful, according to the petition submitted. When this matter was promptly brought forward, it was ruled that given the circumstances of this year, the petition would be accepted as submitted. Since the chief administrators have been informed of this ruling, this matter is hereby communicated. Please understand this and ensure that all taxpayers are informed without exception.

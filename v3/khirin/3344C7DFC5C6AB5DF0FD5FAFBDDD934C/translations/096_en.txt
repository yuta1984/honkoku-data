Regarding the matter of silver contributions for the relief of people in the rural districts:
In the past year and the year before, due to wind, rain, and floods, rice, wheat, and
other goods became expensive, so even those who live reasonably well naturally
appear to be having financial difficulties. Meanwhile, regarding the collection of silver contributions,
last year it was postponed, and from this year until the coming Year of the Tiger it shall be deferred.
However, it was announced last year that those who wish to make silver contributions
regardless of the poor harvest may freely do so.
Among the instructors, regarding this year's matter, both north and south have
experienced good harvests in recent years and have brought in all grain crops without loss, so
there may be those who are prepared to collect silver contributions, but
due to the previous poor harvests and famines, it is still difficult to reach
a situation where relief silver can be repaid, and we hear that generally gold and silver are not in circulation.
Therefore, regarding the aforementioned collection of silver contributions, for now this winter it shall be postponed, and from next spring
until the coming winter of the Year of the Rabbit, it shall be deferred and collected. However, those who wish to make silver contributions
regardless of the poor circulation may freely make silver contributions

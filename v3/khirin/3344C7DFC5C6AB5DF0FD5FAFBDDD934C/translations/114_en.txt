Although the income rice from crops in village areas with sufficient water irrigation is
in reasonable condition, given the nature of this year, everyone is storing food on reduced rations,
and as rice sales have become difficult, market prices are rising one after another. Therefore,
regarding dry field farming villages that submit their annual tax through purchased rice, since the land base
is similarly damaged and in distress, and methods for annual tax submission other than purchased rice have
reached an impasse, we propose that for annual tax rice that villages in Awaji Province submit to 
the stipend recipients here, as well as rice for sale that those stipend recipients send here,
regarding rice that is easy to procure, if dry field farming villages could
procure it to submit for annual taxes and stipend recipient fees as a one-time
exemption, this would broaden the sources for rice purchases and provide
convenient means for swift tax submission. Moreover, if Awaji rice is
procured as collateral for tax submission, having village officials record and
report the amount in koku, purchased rice amounts, etc., and regularly
communicating those village names, amounts, etc. to the New Granary and North Granary
would make official approval appropriate. Therefore, we request that this be ordered as requested for this one time only, and request that
orders be given to the New Granary and North Granary - this is a written proposal
submitted by the district magistrates

○【Red seal】　　　Record of the completed written acknowledgment
One complete copy of the honorable intentions
Regarding the above, concerning what has been proclaimed this time, we were summoned to the magistrate's office and given the following directive: Having heard about the poor harvests and hardships in Oshu and Dewa provinces, as well as the situation where rice and grain are not circulating due to trade restrictions in various provinces, although our domain's circumstances are reasonable given the current state of affairs, in case there should be crop failures this coming summer and autumn, the intention is that the people under the domain's rule should not suffer hardship. Therefore, we should practice frugality and simplicity as much as possible, and above all, understand that conserving rice is of primary importance. This was conveyed orally by the District Magistrate. We were told to carefully communicate these honorable intentions to each [village] and thoroughly instruct [the people] so that no one in the village would be left uninformed. We humbly accept this directive. Truly, this benevolent care is supremely gracious and fortunate. When we were called individually to receive these instructions, everyone was deeply impressed and felt reverent, so we are submitting this written acknowledgment.

...there are those who have not paid. Having forgotten the generous intent announced in the year of the Rat, and using the difficult economic conditions in various districts as an excuse, even those who should be able to arrange their payments have delayed them, naturally resulting in many non-payers, which is quite problematic. Since this interferes with the situation of those who have been making their annual payments without delay and creates inconvenience, this time we shall compile all such non-payers and order the assistant headmen and village headmen to handle them. The instructional personnel responsible for each group shall consult with the nearest head group leaders and village headmen, call together the village headmen and five-person groups, and ensure that those who have delayed their payments make their contributions by the 10th day of the 3rd month at the latest. For those who have misunderstood, thorough instruction shall be provided. Even after this, for those who still fail to make payments due to lack of understanding, or those who have been unable to pay since the first year due to gradually worsening financial circumstances, their respective names, the amounts of silver payments, and the numbers of annual arrears shall all be compiled in district ledgers. The head group leaders and village headmen must submit these without error to the government office by the 16th day.

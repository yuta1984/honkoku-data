　Recently, many destitute people have been observed. These individuals are not only
　local vagrants and homeless persons, but among the townspeople there are also
　those who have residences but go out begging from place to place
　to make ends meet. Therefore, following the situation at Oyamashita,
　has the number of people increased greatly in the Myōdō District area, or
　is this limited to nearby villages, or is this

　Convey this to group leaders and village headmen. Submit reports on the above by tomorrow morning.

Using economic difficulties as an excuse, even those who are capable of making payments
are causing delays, naturally resulting in many non-payers, which is extremely problematic.
Regarding this matter, since this interferes with the morale of those who have been making their annual payments without delay up to now,
which is inconvenient, this time regarding the control of the aforementioned non-payers,
orders are given to the group leaders and village headmen, so each group shall take responsibility.
Those who are to instruct and admonish should consult with the nearest senior group leaders and village headmen, summon the village
headmen and five-person group members, and ensure that those who are delaying their payments
make every effort to complete their payments by the deadline of the 10th day of the 3rd month. For those who are
mistaken in their understanding, provide thorough instruction and admonishment. Even after this, those who still fail to make payments
due to lack of understanding, or those who have been unable to pay
since the first year due to gradually worsening financial circumstances beyond their control,
shall have their respective names as well as the annual amounts
of overdue silver recorded in the district ledgers, and the supervising senior group leaders and
village headmen shall submit these without error to the government office
by the 16th of the same month.

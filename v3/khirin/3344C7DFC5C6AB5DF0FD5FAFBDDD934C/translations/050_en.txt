Those who work adequately as full-fledged workers should be employed according to the rates established above. While in urban areas meal allowances are provided, in rural districts there is no practice of bringing one's own lunch, and except for contract workers, employers are obligated to provide meals, which is why these rates have been established as stated in the main text. Should anyone fail to observe these provisions and improperly increase wages, both employers and employees shall be subject to punishment.

1. Regarding day laborers and servants
In recent years, excessively high wages and salaries have become common, and those who employ them find that even in years of good harvest, the accounts do not balance. Based on genuine considerations, wages and salaries should be reduced to appropriate levels, returning to those of about ten years ago. Originally, day laborers were meant for the homeless or impoverished people to support their families, but they squander their wages on entertainment beyond their station. As for servants, because they cannot pay the annual tax, village officials provide co-signatures and guarantors also provide joint signatures, and this leads to advance payments from their salaries. While they should live frugally according to their station and devote themselves diligently to their service, they instead spend their salaries on food and drink or other imprudent pursuits, troubling their parents, siblings, guarantors, village officials, and employers.

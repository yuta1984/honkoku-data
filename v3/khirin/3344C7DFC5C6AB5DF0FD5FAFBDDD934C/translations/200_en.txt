We believe this might also affect the payment collection methods. Having discussed various matters, in any case, even for the peasants, this merciful measure would be thorough, and regarding the implementation methods that would benefit all parties, our immediate deliberations have not been adequate, and we have discussed various concerns. There are differences between rice tribute from rice fields and certificates from dry fields, as well as differences in the wealth and poverty of village conditions and the quality of internal collection management, making it difficult to standardize across the board.

Therefore, we believe it would be appropriate to address each village individually, consider these circumstances, establish payment rates within the deferred tribute payments, operate diligently for tribute collection, and have the remaining portions extended until next spring.

Considering the conditions of our affiliated villages, we have addressed each village individually according to the separate ledger book, established general payment rates, and respectfully submit this matter. Consequently, among those villages that anticipate the aforementioned payment rates, those requesting extensions of about two to three payment rates are areas where the stipend recipients' annual tributes are typically completed each year. Therefore, even given this year's circumstances, if extensions of these two to three payment rates were granted, we believe they would generally achieve complete payment compared to normal years.

Furthermore, villages that anticipate extensions of about four to seven payment rates are lands where many stipend recipients' annual tribute arrears have accumulated. Therefore, if many payment rates were assigned as previously mentioned, the collection might be better than in typical years.

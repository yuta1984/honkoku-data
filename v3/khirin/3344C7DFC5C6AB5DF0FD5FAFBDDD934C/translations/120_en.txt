First day of the third month

The above was communicated through an official note from Lord Miyagi Asatarō on the first day of the third month. Accordingly, this was transmitted by written correspondence to the villages along the northern route, and the group leader (yotō) of that year informed each group. Therefore, this information should also be passed along to the southern route for reference.

I believe it is of utmost importance to handle the receipt of goods and manufacturing processes without cutting corners, and to expand sales in conducting business. Regarding this matter, we had prepared a basic written agreement, but it has been marked with a cancellation seal. Concerning the handling of these various matters, while I have discussed them with Tokubei's establishment, since all petitions have customarily been submitted by Tokubei's side, the delay in submitting this petition from my end is regrettable and I apologize for any inconvenience caused.

However, regarding the time limit for theft victims to come and examine items after handing over descriptions of similar goods, if time passes and the item turns out not to be stolen property, the original owner will surely come to reclaim it. But if such negotiations do not proceed, the pawn transactions will be hindered, causing great inconvenience to legitimate pawnshop customers at that time. Therefore, regarding this time limit, from the day written notices are given to the ban-hinin, we propose five days for nearby areas and ten days for distant areas. If the theft victim does not come to examine within this period, once the deadline passes and there are people ready to reclaim items, we wish to conduct transactions immediately. We respectfully request that this be officially determined as stated.

1. When theft victims come for investigations of lost property, since similar items can be shown promptly, matters can be resolved quickly. Until now, when hinin had similar items to show, they would make various requests to display them, and upon examination, victims would immediately touch and handle the items. In such cases, if there are items entrusted by samurai households, this is quite concerning, and even with other entrusted items, allowing hinin to handle them seems inappropriate. Therefore, even if items are shown to hinin, unless the actual theft victim examines them, proper identification cannot be made with certainty. We request this be handled as stated in the previous article.

1. Even when the parties concerned and ban-hinin conduct private investigations, easy investigations are never possible. However, sometimes due to ban-hinin's misunderstanding, pawnshops assume investigations should be conducted easily. Later, when thieves are arrested and confess, if there happens to be concealment, it becomes a public matter, and orders are sometimes issued based on what the ban-hinin report, similar to official proclamations. Being ordered in this manner causes great inconvenience. Regarding official notifications from the magistrate's office, when concealment occurs, we request it be handled according to proper procedures.

When they inquired with various city pawnshops in Sako-machi, they were told that there were no pawned items matching the written description, so they had no choice but to return. However, Heigoro, a ban-hinin from Ido village, went to that village and apprehended the thief Yozo for interrogation. Upon questioning, the thief confessed that he had stolen Katsumi's clothing and pawned it at Yabe Kozaemon's pawnshop in the 5th district of Sako-machi. Yosaburo then paid the interest and redeemed the items from Kozaemon. When uninformed peasants go out for investigations, nothing is properly accomplished. Ultimately, unless thieves are apprehended, pawned items cannot be identified, causing hardship to the peasants. As for the non-persons, they normally support their families with the assistance they receive, but if they cannot conduct investigations at such times, they cannot fulfill their duties, causing great distress. Therefore, if you would mercifully order this to continue as before, we would be extremely grateful for this blessing. They have subsequently submitted a written statement to us as shown in the attached document. Although we are reluctant to make repeated appeals to your busy office, this truly causes hardship throughout our rural district, so we humbly submit this document along with our petition. We hope that you will mercifully arrange for prompt consultation on this matter. The above.

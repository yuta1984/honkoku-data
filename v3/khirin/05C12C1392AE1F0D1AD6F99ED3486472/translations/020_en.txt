Since they go out for investigations under the authorized prohibition system, both parties should be instructed on proper conduct so that they are not looked down upon as persons of lowly status and made to waste time in commercial matters, or treated roughly and improperly in examinations.

Therefore, there are requests to prohibit such internal investigations for officially proclaimed items. However, since official proclamations require going through procedures in city and rural areas after petitioning, taking considerable time before reaching the pawnshops and becoming delayed, they unavoidably rush into direct negotiations.

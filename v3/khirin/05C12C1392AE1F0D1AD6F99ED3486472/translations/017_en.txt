When ban-hinin go out, they do not investigate the account books of city pawnshops, but instead instruct that the theft victims should be sent. However, since there are many city pawnshops, it is not easy for a single theft victim to conduct thorough investigations alone. Moreover, even if they encounter thieves, being amateurs, they cannot apprehend them, and while time passes, the thieves will escape. Therefore, the ban-hinin, who normally support their families with village assistance and perform various official duties, face obstacles with city pawnshops. This does not make sense to the peasants, and if they think the ban-hinin are not diligent and this affects the morale of the entire community, naturally their cooperation will diminish and it will become difficult to perform official duties. First and foremost, thieves mostly rely on dishonest people in the city and wander about, and if investigations are not properly conducted, they will become even more emboldened. Conversely, this creates the troubling and distressing impression that the ban-hinin are undisciplined. Therefore, we would be most grateful if you would mercifully order that city pawnshop investigations continue to be conducted as before. The non-person headmen of this district submitted this request to us in writing, and when we discussed it, we realized that indeed, under such circumstances, theft might gradually increase. First and foremost, those who suffer theft face immediate hardship, so we have thoroughly instructed that ban-hinin should not engage in harsh interrogations while carrying out their duties, and that any thoughtless non-persons would be punished. We submitted a detailed petition in April last year requesting that you coordinate with the town authorities to arrange pawnshop investigations as before and issue official notices, but we have received no instructions to date. However, this past July, Katsumi, the younger brother of Yosaburo from Yano village, had clothing stolen in Ido village. Given the aforementioned situation regarding city pawnshops, both Yosaburo from Yano village and Iseya from the same village went out.

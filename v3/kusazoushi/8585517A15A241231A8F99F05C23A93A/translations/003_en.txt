Now then, monsters are creatures that cannot appear during the day, only emerging at night—they are extremely weak beings. However, looking at what has been depicted in kusazōshi (illustrated storybooks) up until now, they merely transform to frighten people, and these monsters do not understand the hierarchy of superiority among their own kind. Therefore, based on their individual achievements in transformation, we shall bestow ranks of reward such as "Highly Excellent," "Excellent," "White Good," or "Black Superior," and so forth. Hence, they should diligently practice their transformations. This is proclaimed to Kitsune Tarō and Tanuki Jirō, who serve as leaders of the monsters.

Monster's Imperial Decree
Great Entrance Hall Demon
Though I am unworthy in status, having become the leader of monsters this year, you must all diligently practice your arts and learn from one another.

The above stated.
We respectfully acknowledge this.

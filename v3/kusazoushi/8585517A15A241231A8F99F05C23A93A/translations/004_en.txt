When the proclamation of the Great Entrance Hall Demon, leader of monsters, was announced, all manner of monsters gathered at the training ground. When they demonstrated their arts, first came the fox to perform the art of a dancing girl.

Fox: "Well now, Ichikawa Monnosuke, where might you be going? Shall I escort you?"

Dancing Girl: "If you would be so kind, please escort me to that place I'm going."

The fox transformed into a dancing girl, using horse dung as a side dish:

"Dear customer, let me perform a dance. Come, let us share some side dishes."

"Oh, how delicious! By the way, what is your name?"

Second came the blue lantern's art. This merely frightens people on nighttime streets, but it is indeed an eerie glowing thing. Its appearance is like a pillar about five feet tall with fire burning and following from behind. This is an art performed using both sets of teeth.

The blue lantern shrinks its neck to become like a square pillar, appearing to burn fire on top to frighten people. This is the light from both sets of teeth.

"How frightening this is! It could well be called the ghost of Fukurokuju."

"Oh, how terrifying! Is it a noodle shop, or perhaps an enemy's night stall? It's a monster called a lantern. Let's flee quickly to Nakajima Tennoji."

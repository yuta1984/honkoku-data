【Bottom of scene - Daughter's dialogue】
What a troublesome man this Mōsan is
Making people tease others
How ridiculous
So disagreeable

【Dialogue of the monk in haori】
Now, now
Young master, please look at this
beautiful woman
Now, speaking of this Iso, there is probably no courtesan in all of Kamakura who can
match her. And yet, because her father is a geta maker,

customer. But we are trying
with gentle persuasion to make her fall
right now, but does this not please

【From here, the son's dialogue】
Mōsan-dono, you should not

How can I make my son
become fond of women?
I tried persuading him

methods
but no matter what,
instead of ginseng,
it works no better than dried
radish

Benten-sama of the Enoshima area
or Konpira-
sama

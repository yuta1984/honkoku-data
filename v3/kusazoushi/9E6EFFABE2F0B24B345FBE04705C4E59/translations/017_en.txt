The two monks Ankera and Konkera were living it up and indulging in luxury. On top of that, Ankera had the idea of becoming famous as a wealthy patron by having their names "Ankera Konkera" embroidered inside their kimono and having it sung in the style of candy peddlers. They performed together with the geisha Kayoshi in a playful manner.

Song:
♪Young ladies are a thing of the past, shiteyansuite, what's the matter? The more you visit, the more, haa, Ankera, Konkera, Konkera, Ankera, you fall in love, haa. Yassa motsa, do it over there, do it here. Jingling and dancing, oi nou.

"What a truly amusing song!" the old woman praised excessively.

Song:
♪Even if the lice are clumsy, if the great-grandchild is good, shiteyansuite, what's the matter? Even complaints that save, korya, suppress them, complaints are also amusing. Yassa motsa, if your eyes are good, come over here. Hen hen heko heko hen. Korya, in Naka-no-cho, geisha-sama, kai nou, oi nou, ot, oi nou.

Hen hen heko heko hen. No, ah, ai nou.

"That song would go well with the shamisen. How interesting!"

"Indeed, the song is extraordinarily well-composed. The master is quite clever."

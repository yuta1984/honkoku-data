Long, long ago, in the story of a certain Mr. Yamada, there lived a man named Zenhon Dayū near the Hatchōbori canal in Kanda. His wife was called Oaya, and though she was gentle, her looks were mediocre and her features plain, so people nicknamed her "Lady Aya."

The Zenhon couple grieved over having no children and prayed earnestly to gods and buddhas throughout Japan. Then one time, both dreamed of swallowing the "Shaka Ten" (the ten of clubs) from a karuta card deck, and they had a son. They named him Shakajūrō, and from the age of five or six, this child was different from other children - arrogant, wearing long kimono with a silver pipe, having his hair done at the barber's, and favoring only stylish things.

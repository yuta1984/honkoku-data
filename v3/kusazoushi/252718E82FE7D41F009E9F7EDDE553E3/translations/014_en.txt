Shaka preaches about the Northern Quarters.
"To the north from here, there is a country called Yoshiwara Upper Soil. Please come with peace of mind. How is it that you speak such witty criticisms about such matters? This is a petition to turn the world's boorish monks into men of refinement. In any case, go to pleasure quarters and become both a fool and a Buddha. Listen to the teachings of Amida Nyorai. From here on, it becomes unbearable to one's sensibilities. How grateful this is! The afterlife will be peaceful, so everyone, please listen leisurely to these teachings."

Because Shaka preached about the Northern Quarters (Yoshiwara) and made people listen, saying "How grateful, how grateful," people became connoisseurs in this world.

"Indeed, Lord Shaka is the incarnation of jest!"

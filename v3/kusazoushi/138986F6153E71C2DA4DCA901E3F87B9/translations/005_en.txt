Konkuhai earnestly desired to become a sophisticated urbanite, and finding Senju a bit depressing, he bought a bag of sophistication at Kyōden's shop on the main street and returned home. The sweet potato seller, who was fond of young greens, built a hermitage next door, and at the entrance hung a sign made of black tororo from the coastal district reading "Surukefushi Konkuhai," and began giving popular lectures on bird calls and such. In recent years, as beasts too began wanting to become sophisticated and gathered around, business greatly flourished, with fried tofu and azuki rice for sale, creating a bustling marketplace at the gate.

【Dialogue of boar-like figure】
So this is Konkuhai, is it? Quite impressive-looking, what a plausible house. It appears he's even borrowing blind musicians' fees.

Just a little □□□ not available. This level of thing is a piece of cake.

【Main text】
Konkuhai smoothly made even the credit-buying meals and boorish beasts feel grateful, but his subsequent actions were unreliable—like the fortune-telling behind Sannō shrine, like the oracle slips at Oji shrine, he might say good things on good days, but his reputation spread not only through the second floors of bathhouses, hairdressing shops, and the pleasure quarters.

【Three-eyed monster's dialogue】
Indeed, how interesting! One can learn and hear sophisticated lectures on discernment night after night.

【Tengu's dialogue】
Yes, yes, teacher, your refreshingly cool lectures are pleasant. But somehow this is like the promotional spiel for tooth powder.

The raccoon dog lord hasn't arrived yet. He's probably beating his belly drum somewhere.

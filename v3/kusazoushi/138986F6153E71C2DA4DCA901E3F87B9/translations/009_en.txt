Moving suddenly from Mukojima to Nagahori, the detached quarters called Sozimmai at Sasamatsuba-ya and the nine o'clock at Takecho correspond to seven o'clock at Yoshiwara, and the time when people return from the mansions. It's only natural that there isn't a single establishment open anywhere - while wandering around the five-block area, when it becomes the time for courtesans to receive customers, even though one might say "Namu Sambo" (Buddha preserve us), if they were human they would have somewhere to return to, but around here there are only monsters.

Since daytime is a time of leisure for them, it should be a time for daytime entertainment, but because it's far too early, they spend about half the day with terribly sour expressions. From in front of the daytime establishments, the teahouses seem melancholy and harsh. The evening bell at six o'clock rings out both peacefully and noisily. They tickle and rouse those who want to buy an active spirit through force and unreasonableness, only to be disliked for it.

[Lower section, man's dialogue]
"Like a sea lion that loves to sleep"

[Middle section, courtesan's dialogue]  
"Is a sea lion something like smallpox, sir?"

[Sea lions are marine mammals known for sleeping a lot. The courtesan is making a pun on "ashika" (sea lion) and "hashika" (measles), asking if it's something like smallpox.]

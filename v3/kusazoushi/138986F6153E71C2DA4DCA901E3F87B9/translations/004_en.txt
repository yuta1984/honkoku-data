Once upon a time,
whether it was Man'hachi or last year,
in the great building
of Shinoda dyeing,
where camphor leaves grew,
there was a disciple fox
called Konkuhai.
There is a saying "peaches and chestnuts in three years,
persimmons in eight years," and
indeed,
among all
living
beings,
which one
is not in the
world of suffering?
The fox too, saying "chitose"
and "kon-kon,"
waits for a thousand
years
[continues to left page]
to become a sophisticated urbanite (ōtsū).
Therefore, the sophisticated person
becomes like a fox,
and the fox becomes like
a sophisticated person—
such is the logic.
Konkuhai too, waiting
for the new year to come,
after forty-nine years
have passed, what joy!
Quickly taking on
a servant's name,
he makes it his habit to deceive others.
His eyebrows are finer
than thread, and therefore
have elegance. Following the old
ways of speech and custom,
wondering whether
tōzan fabric would be good
for clothing, or whether
black hachijō silk would be good,
he deliberates and
becomes like
something close
to that.

The monster companions from the large and small variety halls became sophisticated urbanites through Konkuhai's lectures, but let's stop this boorish gossip about them just deceiving people.

Tanuki: "Well, until I beat my belly drum, I might hum Edo-bushi or practice knitting, so the monsters' dressing room is gradually becoming stylish too. The props for ghosts to ride out on, thin mud drums, the triangular snow cats that the snow woman makes fall, and the red aprons—aren't they like masters of their craft? All covered in spider webs."

The cat-demon and snow woman became female entertainers. Places of note change eventually. Though the rivers provided some amusement, regarding the side combs under the eaves, I'd like to try wearing the hand-me-downs and Atō-san's clothes.

"I want a good sunny day tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll go first with so-and-so. Well then, I'll go to the hermitage at Machiyama. I made a promise. You're also a fine little doll, aren't you?" Not just one person, but up to two, including the leftover courtesans and little spaniels, maintaining proper decorum.

The monsters' dressing room shows territorial divisions—indeed, with the desire of the third floor, it's somewhat like theatrical performance. The area where tanuki live is called Hayashi-chō, and the area where foxes live is called Inari-chō.

"Your design sense comes from Den-san's belly, so to speak."

The cat-demon's way of using ears as guards is also good.

Watōnai crossed over to China, and though he was Japanese, he worked great deeds there. When the Chinese became greatly angered and released a tiger, Watōnai remained completely calm, showing no fear whatsoever. Moreover, he tore the tiger in half, plucked its fur, and rendered it so thoroughly defeated that it wouldn't even serve as a demon's loincloth. The Chinese were so astonished that they all looked at each other and panted "haa haa" (gasping for breath). When Watōnai asked, "Do you surrender? If you put down your hands, will you all become my allies?" they replied "haa haa." When he said "Then become my retainers," they still said "haa haa." Not understanding what they were saying, they simply followed his commands and kept saying "haa haa."

When they arrived safely in Nagasaki, the Chinese retainers were something never seen before, making for quite an extraordinary spectacle.

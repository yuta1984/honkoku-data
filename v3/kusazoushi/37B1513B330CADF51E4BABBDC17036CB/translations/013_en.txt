Takehachi was born in the Year of the Monkey, corresponding to the seventh year of the Tiger, and opened his great fortune. That he now venerates this seventh year also seems to be a long-standing matter. Unlike stories from India and such places, this is an honest tale of Japan.

Up to the third year of Tenmei, the Year of the Water Rabbit (1783), it has been seven cycles of thirteen years. The seventh cycle [?] thirteenth time [?] seems to be a good place, and regarding virtue [?] it appears to be deeply ingrained for a long time. Whoever wrote this moral lesson has a strong preference for it.

Long, long ago, there was a man named Takehachi who lived near Nihonbashi in Edo. Though he had only his mother, he worked as a courier traveling to various provinces on business. Although he was accustomed to the fashionable lifestyle of his travels, he would return to Edo from time to time out of concern for his mother.

This time too, he had business in the western provinces and planned to travel as far as Nagasaki. Even so, without much thought for the maidservant Enoshima or his neighbor, he set out on foot. The one-way journey was about 400 ri, making it 800 ri round trip - a journey so arduous it was embarrassing to even mention. Yet he departed without taking any medicine for strength, having bid his farewells.

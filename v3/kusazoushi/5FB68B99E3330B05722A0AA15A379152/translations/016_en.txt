Because of this, people from neighboring villages also gossiped about it and regarded them as a model of stepmother-stepchild relationships. Matsuhē was also delighted, and now finally his heart was at peace. He left all household matters entirely to his wife, and between farming work, he would travel two or three ri to nearby places for trade. After about two years had passed in this way, another son was born from his current wife, whom they named Futsumatsu.

This woman gradually came to hate Ichimatsu, and in all matters she thought, "If only Ichimatsu were not here, my child Futsumatsu's future would be better." This feeling grew stronger month by month and day by day, which was a terrible thing. However, she appeared to care for him well in public, so Matsuhē never dreamed of knowing her true feelings.

On one occasion, he again went out to nearby areas for business. Now, at the entrance to this village there was a stone Jizō statue that the entire village revered as Sai no Kami (a protective deity). Every time Matsuhē came and went, he would always worship this Jizō and earnestly pray to be spared from evil deeds and disasters, and for his child Ichimatsu's safety and long life. Today as usual, he prayed for peace in the household during his absence and that nothing untoward would happen to Ichimatsu, then departed. Since he always stayed away for two or three days, today too he left prepared for that duration.

His wife thought to take advantage of this absence to eliminate Ichimatsu, but she could not figure out how to plan such a thing. As she pondered this back and forth, the day advanced and it became time for the midday meal. Ichimatsu was innocently playing in the neighborhood, and as is the way with small children, when it was time for the midday meal

Throughout such nights, the usual attendant children were kept in service before her,
and each one was made to tell various stories they had heard and remembered.
Among the diverse tales, there were indeed some mysterious
matters that caught the ear, so I have taken up my brush to record them here.
Originally, those who can well understand the playful words mixed with childish speech
will find them quite fascinating

and amusing. But when those young ones speak fluently yet their words are clumsily connected,
is this due to errors of the brush
or mistakes of the ear? Please think of it broadly
and grant your forgiveness.

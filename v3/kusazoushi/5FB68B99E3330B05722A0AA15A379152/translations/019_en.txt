Thinking that there might be trouble later, the mother took out one of the rice cakes she had and said to Ichimatsu: "If you take this rice cake and offer it to the deity at the crossroads, I will give you food to eat. Quickly take it and present it directly to the Buddha. Until the Buddha takes it in his hands, you must not return home even if dawn breaks. When you see the Buddha take it in his hands, then you may return." She repeatedly instructed him this way. The child, driven by hunger and understanding nothing else, took the rice cake and went out. The mother, thinking that her own hunger might lead her to eat it herself and then lie about having made the offering to the Buddha—something immeasurable in its wrongness—compared this to her own dishonest heart and secretly followed behind, hiding herself and crouching in a corner of the hall to spy. Unaware of this, Ichimatsu did exactly as his mother had told him, facing the Buddha and saying: "Please take this rice cake. If I cannot offer this, I too cannot eat anything. Buddha, please..." He raised his voice and tried to offer the rice cake, but there was a gap of about two feet to the Buddha's hands, and it would not reach. As Ichimatsu jumped up and down, crying as he made his plea, miraculously this Jizo Bodhisattva extended his hand down, took the rice cake that Ichimatsu was offering, and held it in his hand—how blessed this was! The mother, seeing this scene, was greatly shocked and ran out. Her evil thoughts immediately gave way to awakening, and she confessed and apologized for her sins before the Buddha, then embraced Ichimatsu and returned to their home.

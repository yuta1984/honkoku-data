without knowing of wounds or stab wounds, examining them anew and returning them to one's parents with such a heart - have you not heard of this? Even if not to this extent, if you would at least grow up like others, how joyful would your father resting beneath the grass and your mother who speaks thus be! What karmic retribution from a previous life is this, that though born with human form, before even reaching maturity, you have such a terrifying heart like that of demons and spirits?" As she wept and lamented thus, perhaps seeing his mother's unusual dejected state touched the child's heart, for his wild temperament seemed to soften, and he sat there downcast without saying a word. His mother suppressed her tears and said, "From today, reform your heart, stop going out to the mountains and fields,

go serve at a certain temple, and when you have leisure, devote your heart to learning and calligraphy." She taught him earnestly, had him accompanied by a long-serving retainer of the house, and relied on a Zen priest at a temple in a mountain village more than five ri away as his teacher, telling him beforehand in detail about this child's condition and requesting that "even temporarily, he must not be allowed to return to his hometown." She repeatedly sent earnest messages. This priest had traveled throughout the provinces on pilgrimage before becoming head priest of this temple, so having already seen and heard of this child's misdeeds, he thought to somehow correct his true nature and reform him. He applied strict prohibitions and disciplinary measures without relaxing his vigilance, so the child's heart gradually began to turn toward good, and he slowly began to learn calligraphy and reading.

"Why have you come?" Saku replied: "I set out to go to the mountains the other day when a stranger came and said 'Please come this way,' inviting me to follow. Without really going anywhere, I arrived at a large mansion where many beautiful women came out, led me inside, and entertained me with every possible delicacy. When evening came and I said I should return home, they said 'just a little longer,' so I stayed one day, then two days, thinking today made the third day—but to think that three years had actually passed is most mysterious!" She too was infinitely puzzled by what had happened to her. That very night, Washizo and his wife, and Sōemon and his son all had the same dream, which was truly wondrous. A middle-aged man in proper court dress appeared and spoke: "I am one who dwells in this area. Your daughter Saku was naturally deep in filial piety and, lamenting your wickedness as parents, for three years never ceased for a single day to make her way to me in supplication. Moved by her sincere devotion without duplicity, I transformed her natural misfortune, making her temporarily absent from this world to remove disaster, and now grant her return with a new span of life from Heaven. For this reason, your evil thoughts and karmic retribution have also been swept away and you have become good-hearted—this is by no means a private matter. Continue to guard this state for a long time to come."

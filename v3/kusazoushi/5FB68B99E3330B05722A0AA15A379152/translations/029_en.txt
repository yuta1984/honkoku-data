Speaking to Washizo, he said, "No matter how much I say, my words cannot bring her back. This was my son's carelessness, and there is no excuse for it. I can only imagine the feelings of you as her parents. However, even though it may be futile, medical treatment is most important. Please take the injured person home and have a doctor examine her." Washizo agreed that this made sense, so he had a wooden door brought over, placed Saku on it, and carried her home.

The doctor used all available medicine and treatments, but to no avail. The next day, alas, the sixteen-year-old flower scattered her petals. Sotadayu and the entire Sozaemon household gathered together, worrying about what should be done, having no peace of mind, and everyone remained in hiding. Since Washizo was a man who twisted even trivial daily matters, they wondered anxiously what he might say about his daughter's death.

They could not rest easy. Naturally, the grief of the Washizo couple was beyond words. The first seven-day memorial service had ended and more than ten days had passed, but nothing had been heard from Washizo's side. Everyone was thinking it would come today or tomorrow, and even the forty-nine-day period was passing, but he had not come to make any accusations. Sotadayu found this strange and thought, "This is incomprehensible." Being unable to leave matters as they were due to his paternal concern, he went to Washizo's house, where he found the couple sitting facing each other in conversation. Sotadayu announced himself and entered the house. After offering condolences and such, he said, "Now that Osaku's mourning period has ended, please treat my son Sozaemon as a murderer and punish him. This is a small amount, but please accept it as money for Osaku's memorial service," and he presented fifty gold coins. Washizo remained silent for a while.

People think that daitsu-jin (great connoisseurs) and tōrimono (sophisticated persons)
are those who only gamble
or spend their time
in frivolous pursuits.
This is what we call the foolish thinking of boors and dullards.
Being a "great connoisseur" is not a
new thing - it encompasses the
three ways of Shinto, Confucianism, and Buddhism. From when the deities Izanagi and
Izanami began the way of
husband and wife from the
floating bridge of heaven, through the
drunken wisdom of sages, the Buddha's teaching of
"come, share one lotus destiny,"
Dharma's
great teaching, the great way of Shingon esoterics,
and Kōbō Daishi's profound
teachings beyond these -
if one understands these deep matters, even Idaten's compassion

the part about
sacred sake
would be good.

will not be missed. Simply the teaching
of rebirth in paradise through "Namo Amida Butsu,"
Nichiren's
passionate writings,
the Ikkō sect's
invitations and corrections -
all of these are
preparations for being a great connoisseur. In any case,
having no sharp edges
in one's heart
and living
with laughter -
this is called both
a great connoisseur
and a sophisticated
person.

"What kind of
talk is this?
It won't grow cold. Shouldn't we
have a cup soon?" - when
sake is about to begin,
this has been the
way since ancient times.

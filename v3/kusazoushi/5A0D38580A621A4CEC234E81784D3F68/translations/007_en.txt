As stated in the fifth act of Chushingura,
Hayano Kanpei, though there were
errors of youth,
foolish as he was, enjoyed this
way of life.
For example, buying
an eighty-five monme courtesan
and spending about thirteen monme
on entertainment,
returning home early
with the house master
welcoming him well
with joy - even if his manner
is boorish or whatever,
these things are reasonable
and he should be called
a true connoisseur.
Also, the old-fashioned
type of person
with a fifteen monme courtesan

yet.

buying her for about
eighteen monme, being extremely
lovesick
in appearance, but with only three monme
worth of consideration -
if he puts forth
twice the effort in buying
the light, superficial flattery
that pleases her,
this is not a parent's heart.
Those who make this
their pleasure are clearly
not true connoisseurs.
Being lovesick
over buying courtesans
is of no
use whatsoever.
Only those who patronize
the highest-ranking courtesans
should be called
great connoisseurs or
traditionalists.

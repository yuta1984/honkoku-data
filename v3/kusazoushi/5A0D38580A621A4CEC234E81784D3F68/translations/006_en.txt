Confucius too said
that things don't always suit the times.
Don't fuss over
old-fashioned styles and ancient customs -
as befits one's age,
with old-fashioned devotion.
What about the foundation of the hair?
Below, like in the old days,
the dignified style or bunkin
style - how could today's young people
manage such things? They seem mad.
Fashion too
must be done according
to the times, or else first of all
there's no vitality
in the heart, and to please
everyone,
whether with light blue lining
or whitish tea color,
around yesterday...

[Bottom right of page]
Don't get
angry
easily.
Getting
angry
is not
the way of
refined
people.

[Continuation from top right]
Like someone who came
from the countryside -
well then, that won't
make you useful
as a young person either.
Well now,
even being flashy,
if you work hard
at business and
take good care of your parents,
there would be
some merit, wouldn't there?
Don't trouble yourself
too much
fussing over
worldly affairs.
Just leave them
be.

Somehow
I want to talk
about illness
and
women.

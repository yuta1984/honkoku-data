In an old linked verse, there is "At Koromo River, only the sound of hammers flows." Speaking of tools, saws are also tools, and sword mountings made slender, while surrounding implements range from Satsuma sake bottles to brass kettles that one desires, and when it comes to Hiroshima kettles, one becomes somewhat fond of Chinese goods, mixing Chinese and Japanese items together. People criticize others saying "that man's hobby is bad" or "how about this," but everyone's path of enjoyment differs. Some love Noh chanting.

(Dialogue on the right bottom):
"I spotted some fine dishes for five people yesterday as bargain finds"

(Continuation from right top):
There are those who love dance songs, Handayu-bushi, and Gidayu-bushi, Bungo-bushi, meriyasu, and nagauta - each according to their taste, and naturally their eyes are drawn to corresponding tools. If you criticize others, you too will be criticized - arguments are forbidden as usual. Simply paying attention to everyone's enjoyments and saying nothing is what makes one a true connoisseur. There are also those who think that arguing makes them seem like connoisseurs.

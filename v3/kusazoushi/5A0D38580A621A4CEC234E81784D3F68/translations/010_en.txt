In the Noh chant of "Hachi no Ki" (The Potted Trees), it says "I have many trees, but I offer them all to people," and even now I have plum, cherry, and pine trees.

Having these preferences for plum, cherry, and pine trees as a hobby, I've gotten into the business of mathematics, and everything is like this.

Anyone who's a great fool should go beyond Hakone. Whatever happens, if you keep your heart light and live in comfort and amusement, even madness has its pleasures. No matter how old you get, there's no thought of dying. Perhaps only this place is a bit boorish.

"Only when winning, and not caring about afterwards"
"That won't do"
"Firewood, or I want something even worse"

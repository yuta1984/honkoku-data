Chiyoma, a student of Takebe Genzō, says:
"Learning during the master's absence is a great loss, you bald monk. When the clean copying of characters comes later, not a single character can be read. Worrying about this, they put up tavern signs saying 'tavern' to advertise, and none have missed opportunities since ancient times. Moreover, in recent years, masseurs have also increased and advertise as 'masseur,' wind chimes announce soba and udon with their sounds - it's a world without subtlety. Going beyond this, for connoisseurs to make their appearance just a bit more impressive must be quite troublesome."

(Dialogue on the right bottom):
"Soba shop owner, what time is it?"
"Past four o'clock, since the sister from Honjo is returning"

(Continuation from right top):
"What a dignified sound, wooden hat on a hail day" is a verse by Master Bashō.
In the past, the sound of geta clogs would stir one's heart a little, but today's geta clogs are not elegantly refined. That we are not startled by the sound of clogs must be a sign of peaceful times. For geta clogs, when going from inside the garden to the neighbor's, one wore cloud-patterned ones, but now people wear them walking even long distances. Women's geta clogs are in the bold style of Tomoe Gozen, showing women's strength. Women are best suited for women's tasks. Sandals with center removed, with straps attached - "Six Amidas" - how auspicious.

The man calling "beating, summer tofu," the sound of geta clogs - everything is strangely incomprehensible.

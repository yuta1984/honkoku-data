In Rennyo Shonin's
letters: "Even if called
a cattle thief,
a Buddhist practitioner should
appear as one who
doesn't seem like such a person" - 
this admonition tells us
we should not make our appearance
conspicuously sophisticated.
Those who display the signboard
of "great connoisseur"
in their fashion,
walking around ostentatiously -
among them are those who say
"This small pattern is
my design, this family crest too
is my invention,"
though it's nothing from Hakata,
and in their affected manner, with
light green obi,
long haori, and
hanging ornaments, even their bookshelves...

[Bottom right of page]
Somehow aimlessly
walking around, their vigor
is exhausted.

There should be stubbornness
in boorishness...

[Continuation from top right]
There are too many fakes
and it's bewildering - the value of being
a "great connoisseur" has become cheap.
I wish that the position
of great connoisseur would first
be yielded to
true masters,
making the heart
primarily sophisticated,
and that boorishness
could be sent
smoothly away
to the
western
sea.

Give me another
cup now.

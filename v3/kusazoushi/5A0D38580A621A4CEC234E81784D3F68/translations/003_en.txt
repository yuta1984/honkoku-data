When spring flowers bloom,
and the moon shines so clearly it seems like autumn,
and then snow falls,
there are pleasures
in each of the four seasons,
but beyond all that,
one wishes
to become a great connoisseur (daitsu-jin)
and live such a life.
Here lived Shin-
dai ni fusoku-
naku Hyōe-toku, who went by
the name Yojō,
in Utsunomiya.
Not knowing
the delights of being a great connoisseur,
he racked his brains day after day
hoping somehow to enter that path.
Then, drowsily during an afternoon nap, in a dream,
amid a faint pleasant
fragrance, not elsewhere, but in his own garden
where tea and rice could be prepared, he had a dream of enlightenment.

Nihonbashi - Starting Point

【Main Text】
The travel sugoroku worked well, and like using Tawaraya with a favorable wind, it makes sense. Having Nihonbashi as the starting point is quite strict. In return, for such a distinguished lord, nothing ordinary can be shown, and by his lordship's will that everything should follow the sugoroku exactly without the slightest deviation, since Nihonbashi is the starting point, there are even jokes like a porter's saying "let's throw the dice as we go from there."

At that time, his lordship proclaimed: "Attention, attention! Though Takanawa is present, from here I shall throw [the dice]... without ○ calculation, making incantations and throwing the dice." How strange! At this moment, forgetting themselves and shouting about the game, two or three people spoiled their audience with the lord.

(Lodging) Odawara

【Main Text】
Having rolled another one at Oiso, he immediately reached the Odawara lodging - what an unexpectedly quick arrival. He leisurely arrived around the fourth hour of the day (around 10 AM). The sugoroku depicts a uiro shop with one young man of unknown identity in semi-official garb, one poor-looking customer, with "Please give me one package" written. He orders this to be carried out exactly.

Since there was no young man of unknown appearance in the uiro shop, the lord was troubled, but urgently selected a shabby young man after consideration and added him to the scene.

【Illustration dialogue】
That one doing the work has done well. Increase his stipend by rice for two people.

Project your voice more loudly.

Please give me one package. Is this level of tone acceptable?

Hakone

【Main Text】
Having rolled a one at Odawara, he immediately reached neighboring Hakone. This place is inherently hopeless and gets nowhere. Even when retainers are in a hurry, he pays no mind. When the sugoroku board is opened, someone has forgotten their travel permit and must return to Edo. He immediately orders them to act out this exact situation. Those who can walk and seem capable are sent back to Edo. No waste permitted.

【Illustration dialogue - House wall?】
What shall we do? Shall we receive some provisions?

Then we shall return to Edo, go around in circles two or three times, and come back.

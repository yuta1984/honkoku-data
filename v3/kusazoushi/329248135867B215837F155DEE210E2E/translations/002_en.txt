Using the board game "Dōchū Sugoroku" (Travel Sugoroku) in the jōruri play "Koi Nyōbō Somewake Tedzuna" moved the hearts of beautiful young men across hundreds of miles - this is quite understandable.

Here, someone who is about sixteen generations removed from the hundredth generation descendant of that princess, called "Umanosuke-dono," was extremely dull-witted. To him, "bunbu" (literary and military arts) meant only the "bunbuku teapot" (a folk tale), and "ryōtō" (two swords) meant having two heads like a snake. He was truly like someone shooting a gun randomly in the dark when it came to the arts.

However, following the wise saying "Send your beloved child on a journey" and the lord's wishes to "let him travel," though there was also a precedent and rule that "travel is reluctant."

The chief retainer, sixty-something Dayū, initially recommended using the old-fashioned travel sugoroku, and the middle-ranking retainers, all with intelligent-looking faces, withdrew.

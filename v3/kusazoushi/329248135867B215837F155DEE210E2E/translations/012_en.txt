Akasaka (Lodging)

【Main Text】
Rolling a five at Arai, passing through Shirasuka, Futagawa, Yoshida, Goyu, to Akasaka where women forcibly pull customers in to stay. For the lord, this is a pleasure spot. Those feeling good can roll to their heart's content. Strong fellows, all hundred or so of the lord's retainers, become entranced like stage actors and stay the night. In Akasaka, fools spend two hundred coins and five-mon currency on being pulled in.

I'm just wearing torn clothes of a forty-year-old woman.

If it's the lord, he won't be emotionally moved.

I report: Five hundred people had their clothes torn. Three hundred people scraped their feet or were pulled at. The rest I shall report in due course.

Kuwana

【Main Text】
Rolling a six at Akasaka, hitting Fujikawa, Okazaki, Chiryu, Narumi, Miya, and Kuwana - specialties of grilled clams and chestnuts. There's one person grilling and one person eating. Others, even if they want to eat, absolutely cannot eat. One fellow named Orisuke, who got his turn to eat, is fortunate to have eaten his fill of clams and chestnuts. All the remaining retainers hunger for clams and chestnuts, gulping with their throats, and it's truly pitiful to watch.

Some don't even get to sip the broth, making desperate puns about wanting to eat at the barrier of sake.

"How about secretly letting me have just one?"

By the master's orders, not even the broth is allowed.

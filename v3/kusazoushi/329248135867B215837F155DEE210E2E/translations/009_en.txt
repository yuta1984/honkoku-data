Yoshiwara

【Main Text】
Having rolled a four at Hakone, this time it's Hara, Yoshiwara. Due to rough weather, a three-day stay. The sugoroku shows someone looking at Mount Fuji, and even the packhorse drivers, if they cannot see Fuji, are made to examine it through papier-mâché models. Now truly bringing out attendants and having them serve sake.

【Illustration dialogue】
Though not Fujiya Izaemon, the snow on this papier-mâché Fuji is quite amusing.

Yes, yes, yes.

Hair dressing fee: 8 soku, distant place courtesy fee: 10 monme total, paid. There's not much waste.

Sake server, watch out for the horse's urine.

Fuchu

【Main Text】
At Yoshiwara the weather finally cleared, and this time rolling a five to reach Fuchu. The sugoroku picture shows one person making Abekawa mochi and one person eating. Since this isn't available along other parts of the journey, it can be had cheaply. A samurai is sent ahead to have the mochi ready for eating.

【Illustration dialogue - Customer】
Innkeeper, though it's troublesome, please stay in that position until the lord arrives. I too must keep eating like this. There's quite a reason for this.

【Illustration dialogue - Shop owner】
Well then, as for what goes with the mochi, it's mochi with barley flour.

Shinagawa

【Main Text】
The lord rolled a one at Nihonbashi and first arrived at Shinagawa. Though he had planned that from there he could easily reach as far as Totsuka while there was still daylight, saying "if we're pulled along by the dice," he forcibly proceeded to Shinagawa. Here he brought out the sugoroku board, and looking closely, he saw that if the place called Shinagawa didn't have "lodging" written on it, one must absolutely not stay there, and everyone must remain standing upright until the next morning. If one disobeys this, it would go against the lord's command, go against the dice, going against two commands, so "alas, with three commands we meet such a fate" - he speaks such drowsy logic.

We have been standing since this morning. What could this be about?

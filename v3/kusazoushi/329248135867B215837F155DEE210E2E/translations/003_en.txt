Following ancient custom, since Jinenjo no Sankichi (a character from "Koi Nyōbō Somewake Tedzuna") carrying sugoroku was an auspicious precedent for departure, messengers were sent to every horse station entrance and exit throughout Edo to search for a packhorse driver named Sankichi who carried travel sugoroku. However, though they searched for about a hundred days in places from Hakone eastward where such unseemly mimicry and monsters should not exist, they could not possibly find him.

♪Still, humming "Yotsuya, Shinjuku, stylish people's character ○," truly at Azuma's finest horse station, though not Sankichi himself, they encountered a packhorse driver named Saburō from Hachiōji who resembled him - this was neither strange nor wonderful.

No matter how much they searched, if they couldn't meet the exact packhorse driver as written, they had no choice. Thinking that mistaking Sankichi for Saburō would be acceptable, when they calculated: Sankichi was twelve or thirteen, Saburō was about thirty - even reading this backwards as thirteen and forcing the interpretation, the sugoroku was still insufficient. Wondering what to do and being at a loss, "when three people gather, they have the wisdom of Monju" - exercising their crucial wisdom, they declared "it's best to buy sugoroku at a bookstore." This wisdom truly surpassed even Zhuge Liang and Kusunoki Masashige, so it is recorded here.

Given the current times, long potatoes are jinenjo, so let's make it Saburō. By the way, how is your hoarse voice before your lord?

That's where both the stench and attraction lie in the way of love.

How now, packhorse driver, what is this? Is your assumed name not said to be Jinenjo no Sankichi? Do you truly not possess travel sugoroku?

♪You seem to be from Edo's inner circle, there are no jinenjo but soon, burdock, burdock, potatoes, potatoes are for sale!

The horse was amazed by these people's cleverness, but since it cannot speak, it silently goes along - what a truly peaceful situation.

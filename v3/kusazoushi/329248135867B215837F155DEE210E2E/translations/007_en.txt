(Lodging) Totsuka

【Main Text】
Having learned his lesson from standing upright at Shinagawa, he quickly threw the dice and rolled a five, so from Shinagawa through Kawasaki, Kanagawa, and Hodogaya to Totsuka - he landed on a true lodging place marked "lodging." Looking at the sugoroku board, there is a picture of a person in a stationary bath with a woman standing nearby. He orders this to be carried out exactly as shown. Among his retainers, he selects one who particularly enjoys long baths and doesn't mind getting overheated, has him enter the bath until the inspection is complete, and assigns a woman to attend him.

【Right Illustration - Woman's dialogue】
How long must I remain like this?

【Left Illustration】
This woman, playing her role as depicted in the sugoroku, pleases the lord, and he pays twenty-four mon. His private parts might get so boiled they become a local specialty of this place. What a pity!

Oiso

【Main Text】
Having rolled a three at Totsuka, he landed on Fujisawa and Oiso. The sugoroku depicts a man holding a tiger stone and another smoking tobacco. Again he orders this to be carried out exactly as shown. Thirty servants holding stones and twenty foot soldiers watching them take turns serving as officials who come to inspect, speaking nothing but nonsense.

【Center Illustration - Lord's dialogue】
Somehow, the way you're lighting that pipe still seems too low.

【Left Illustration - Pipe-smoking man's dialogue】
Is this level acceptable?

【Bottom Right Illustration - Right man's dialogue】
Let's continue this way until the lord finishes his inspection.

【Bottom Illustration - Stone-holding man's dialogue】
Since it's the lord's command... Please forgive me if I turn my back to the officials or do anything improper.

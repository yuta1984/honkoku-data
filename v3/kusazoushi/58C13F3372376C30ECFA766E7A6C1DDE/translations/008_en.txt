From then on, Momotaro intended to make people think he was a kappa and frighten them, so he was playing by the riverbank. A real kappa emerged from the river and grabbed him, saying "What kind of guy is this, coming to work in my territory?" When he saw it was a human, the kappa was greatly delighted and immediately tried to steal his buttocks. Just then, a night heron flew over, licked the kappa, and inquired about Momotaro's circumstances.

The night heron had long been on friendly terms with the yokai, so it had heard about this matter. It took care of Momotaro, raised him, brought him into the group of monsters, and with great care taught him various techniques for shapeshifting. Now that he had become quite a cunning fellow, they decided to take him deep into the mountains. They thought that if they left him there without cutting his hair or using hot water for bathing, letting him run wild in the mountains, he would surely become monster-like. So they accompanied him deep into the mountains.

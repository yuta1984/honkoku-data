When they agreed to guide
the traveling monk to
the old temple,
he was delighted and
decided to
stay
here for
that night.
♪Oh my, you've been so
kind to me.
Tomorrow I'll meet
with you and we'll
talk more.
Well then, farewell for now.

【Villager's dialogue】
♪We've prepared
plenty of firewood.
Please make some tea
and make yourself comfortable.
That monk is also
an unnecessary troublemaker.

【Right page bottom, villager's dialogue】
Please rest
peacefully even though
it may be lonely.
Tomorrow
we'll meet
again.

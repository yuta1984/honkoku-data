Indeed, it was quite reasonable to rebuild the temple, and the whole village gathered to celebrate with joy.

♪I offer just a small celebration, but the monster has already been driven away somewhere by the Zen master's sacred poetry, so afterwards this place will be peaceful and prosperous.

We hope this illustrated booklet will receive favorable reviews for being well-made.
With all due respect, we humbly state this.
How auspicious!

I'll toast with this tea bowl! Let's drink heartily and make merry!
Somehow I feel incredibly joyful!

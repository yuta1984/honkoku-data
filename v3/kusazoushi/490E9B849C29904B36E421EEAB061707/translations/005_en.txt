Then Jōun went
to the monster-haunted old temple,
and as the night
gradually deepened,
the chilling wind
was so eerie that it made
one's hair
stand on end.

When a foul-smelling
wind blew,
a one-eyed
figure in a large furisode kimono
appeared slowly, holding
a tanzaku poem strip, and in a truly
pitiful voice sang loudly:

♪Tonight's
moon shines clear
in the sky, but...
[The spirit] only recited the lower verse
of the poem, then cried "wah!"
and vanished
completely.

[Top left page, dialogue of the one-eyed furisode spirit]
Monk,
please add
the upper verse

[Bucket's dialogue]
♪Stop, stop!
Such verses
should go in a bucket—
Puns
would be
much
better!

[Bottom right page, peasants' dialogue]
What's this about? It doesn't
make any sense to my ears.
Somehow the back
of my neck
is starting to
tingle with fear.

[Jōun the monk's dialogue]
Well then,
I'll
add the
upper verse:

♪On this bright moon night, below we shall
eat dumplings—
What a fine verse!
Simple, and is this
acceptable?

Excuse
me,
young
page,
I am
your
page/servant.
Please look
favorably
upon me.

[The text continues describing a humorous passage about characters and their adventures, including references to Sumida River, temple bells, and spring days]

There is an amusing passage, and within this foolishness, En-jirō, wanting to try his hand at the flirtations business, decides to become a paper seller since it's work suited to gallants, and sets out as a paper seller even before summer arrives. This is from a kusazōshi (illustrated popular fiction) from the era when fan-paper sellers walked around.

Since illustrations of paper sellers are rare nowadays, I have excerpted them earlier.

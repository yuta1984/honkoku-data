Finding people's shamisen practice unsatisfying to watch, he had some familiarity with joruri and intended to start with "Kato-hime no Michiyuki" (The Journey of Princess Kato), planning to perform the "san no kiri" (third section) like an amateur performer. Before even learning "Chidori Mondo" (Plover Dialogue) or Torafu's "ni no kuchi" (second entrance), he aspired to perform the Harutayu scene from "Imoseyama" (Mount Imose). When someone said "there might be something," he brought items from Sankatsu's writing place.

Having brought these items, he began out of necessity. To put it metaphorically, like deep mountain trees and capital flowers together, "the space is narrow" - for some reason, even watching was pitiful, and with an unpleasant voice he learned one section. With only that as his foundation, he went around to various gatherings, was praised as "skillful, skillful," and at Mai no Ki thought himself "truly remarkable." When new joruri came out, he would go listen under the platform for about five days. Without proper training, he would perform the kakeyai (dialogue) section of the seventh act of "Chushingura" in a half-crying voice, quickly doing the insufficient Yuranosuke in the style of Masatayu, coming to the pillar of the Great Buddha - thick and unparalleled.

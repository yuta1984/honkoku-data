Now Yoshimatsu has become a fine young man, and while he's still well-behaved, they decided to get him a wife. They made arrangements with a suitable family, and having chosen an auspicious day, they plan to send the formal engagement token. Though a foolish child is still endearing, father Jinroku is not yet a proper adult and remains a burden. Like an apprentice at Tenkawaya, he cannot even keep his forelocks properly arranged. Taking advantage of his inexperience in hair-styling, they have been making him submit to this treatment. Since childhood, the family doctor's assessment was "this level is better than nail-cutting," and that single hope is like being attached to a hundred-ryo lottery ticket.

Even if the temples get hot, it's fine - it's unbearably painful!

Jisuke, just give him a proper adult topknot (mage) - that would be stylish!

Send someone to the kimono shop and see - no matter how much we layer it, it should be ready by now.

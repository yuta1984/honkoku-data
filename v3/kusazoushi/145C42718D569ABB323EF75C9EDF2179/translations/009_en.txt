Since Jinroku has improved somewhat and can now speak a little thanks to the gods' blessings, thinking that if he began some kind of lessons he might become more sociable, they consulted the doctor Denhaku, and even his father said he would pay a little money for it, so they encouraged Jinroku. When asked "What would be good for you?" he replied "I have no idea," so they made lots for various arts and drew them as if they were oracle slips from Daishi-sama. The first lot was singing (utai), the second was drumming (tsuzumi), the third shamisen, the fifth jōruri, the sixth swordsmanship, the seventh flower arrangement, the eighth haikai poetry, the ninth scholarship, the tenth tea ceremony. If he studied this much, then afterwards he could freely learn everything from jūshu-kō (ten-variety incense ceremony), renga (linked verse), kokyū (Chinese fiddle), dora (gong), to myōhachi (temple bells).

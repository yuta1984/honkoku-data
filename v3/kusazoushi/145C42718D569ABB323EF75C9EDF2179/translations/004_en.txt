As the saying goes, "Jinroku the heir" - while elder brothers' names are common everywhere in the world, he thought the younger brother's name would be good, so his father named him on a whim. However, a hundred mouths for four mon coins makes sixteen mon, almost a loophole. Whenever he plays "it," he always ends up being the blindfolded demon when they open the flattened octopus at the bottom of the purse with only string marks, getting picked on by himself, and on top of that, becoming the lending demon with a hundred others makes things troublesome.

The demon's head won't come off, and when he tries to play lord and retainer, he becomes the horse. In shoe-hiding games, he eats shells and gets his back covered in dirt, staining his kimono as anyone can tell from his nose.

Jinroku had been projecting his voice too much in singing, so finding singing alone uninteresting, he wanted to try instrumental music as well. He learned rhythm and moved up to the small drum, learning the technique and starting by hitting it skillfully like striking the bottom of a bucket. When he felt like playing even gentle pieces as a percussion instructor, a friend came to chat and said, "Why don't you, instead of just going 'ya-ha,' try something more substantial, whether ni-agari or san-sagari? There's a wonderful place where Nawatoshi goes, so I'll recommend you to your master."

Even though he wasn't from the Okazaki pleasure quarters, he started with cat claws, made them thin from the obi onward, scattered even ivory picks around, added family crests to pictures, and wanting to quickly learn from his heart with certainty, he wished to go out on roof boats and play Gion festival music. Without knowing how to tune the instrument, he only fiddled with the string positions of the picks, listened and learned from various places where people practiced, and gradually tried it out in seated performances.

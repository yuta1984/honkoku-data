Kōsuke stole his master's money and, relying on a slight connection, became a freeloader in the Yanaka area. He had clothing made according to his own preferences: a black nanako silk haori jacket with small-pattern crepe and variant hachijō silk to show off, wearing a single sword with shark-skin scabbard in the dropped style, with a black satin obi featuring red-thread chrysanthemum-longevity patterns woven in, and hakama with lining that would show when he turned around. He regularly walked around Asakusa Yamashita, Ryōgoku, Mukōjima, and throughout Edo, but to people's eyes he appeared to be a man with an ungainly, flattened physique.

When he overheard daughters here, wives there, and teahouse women calling out "Narihira! Narihira!" he thought to himself: "The Narihira of old was apparently a court noble. He was a ladies' man who captured the hearts of many women. Since I'm also handsome, it seems I'm being called the modern-day Narihira—that's how I got this nickname. But it's troublesome to be loved by all the women of Edo."

Plum Blossom: "Look, look! There goes that Narihira again!"

The passersby all turn around to look at Kōsuke's affected dandy appearance.

"What an outrageous fellow!"
"He doesn't even look like a real connoisseur."

"Being so beloved by women is quite a burden."

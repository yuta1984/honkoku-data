Since Tokubei had become a young adult, he was no longer a child, and even minor business matters were now taught to him more deeply than before, and he worked with increasing attention to reason and proper conduct. Kōsuke, despite being a layabout by nature, felt somewhat frustrated that Tokubei, who was younger than him, was entrusted with the account books. However, he resigned himself to the fact that he could never imitate Tokubei's proper conduct and instead focused even more on polishing his masculine appearance. However, being naturally stocky and having a flat figure, his masculine appeal was inferior to Tokubei's. But in his own mind, he thought, "That Tokubei looks so unfashionably dull. I'm definitely more manly than him." He styled his hair so that the crown of his head was concealed, kept his sideburns sharply trimmed like see-through hair, left a bit of his precious eyebrows as an excuse and slicked them down, and wore his cap in a stylish, exaggerated manner.

[Dialogue within the illustration]
Kōsuke: "Come out here. Well, let me sketch your hairstyle."

"No need. These days I go to the bath with an outrageous Mimasu-patterned hand towel and stay for about two hours in the nice hot water. Look, Tokubei, pull out that pipe you have at your waist. I took a quick look, and both the bowl and the mouthpiece hole are the same eight-bu size."

"Let's fix up your hairstyle today too. Please excuse me and let me serve you."

"Yes, yes, this pipe is called 'large-grain hari.' With this one, I can smoke properly."

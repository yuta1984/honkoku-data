After that, Tokubei also took a wife from among his relatives, and on that occasion, again petitioned the retired master to arrange for Kōsuke as well, having him marry Okiku. Both households prospered and flourished day by day. The Tokubei couple devoted themselves to filial piety toward the retired master and Tokuemon couple, and they prospered cheerfully welcoming the auspicious spring. On this auspicious occasion, we humbly request your continued favorable patronage of this trivial tale of two men from Ise, saying only "good, good." Respectfully.

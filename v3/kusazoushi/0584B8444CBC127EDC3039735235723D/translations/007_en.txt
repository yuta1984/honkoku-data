Kōsuke had to have everything exactly to his liking. If he were to learn properly, he would have wanted to drive out both his master and Tokubei, but that was pointless. Eventually deciding to abscond from the shop, he planned to dress himself up as a dandy with plenty of money and have courtesans fawn over him for his amusement. So he stole one hundred ryō in gold, hung it around his neck, and set off for "Zuitokuji" (a play on words meaning to slip away quickly).

"Until now I've been meddling in everyone's hairstyles and the width of their kimono, saying this and that with great authority, but all of them will probably live their whole lives as oddballs and waste away. How pitiful."
"Woof woof woof"
"Even the dog is boorish. It has no sense. Bark quietly—I'm busy!"

In Tokuemon's household, when they got up in the morning as usual, the hundred ryō that had been kept in the drawer of the money box was nowhere to be seen, and the key was left discarded beside the box. Since Kōsuke had eloped, no suspicion fell on anyone else, but everyone in the household was shocked.

"That bastard—I thought he might do something like this. What a detestable fellow. Where will the master's punishment fall?"

"My, my, how terrible! To steal money from his master who has shown him such great kindness—especially such a large sum—and then flee! This is simply inhuman behavior. One cannot be too careful with people. Please, you too should never let your guard down."

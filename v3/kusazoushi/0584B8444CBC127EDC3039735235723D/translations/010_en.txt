From then on, Kōsuke—whether it was his love for rich pork soup or his lecherous nature—continued for five or six years, daily consuming eels, soft-shell turtles, sea otters, and all other medicinal preparations that pleased him. Even so, he couldn't stay indoors, and whenever he ventured out, people would comment: "We haven't seen Narihira lately. Ah, there he goes over there. Did he just head toward Asakusa? Yesterday we saw him at the Peacock Tea House." Being talked about like this, he became even more careful with his health, thinking he would continue his health regimen for another ten years until he could drink his fill until his big belly nearly burst. Unable to keep relying on others' care, he rented lodgings from a shrine guide and lived alone. But when would he need to take a wife? Even if he were to have five hundred wives, he wasn't the Emperor, so he wouldn't have three thousand court ladies—he settled this as merely his personal preference.

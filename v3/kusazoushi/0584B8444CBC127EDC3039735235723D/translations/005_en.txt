After that, though saying "time flies like an arrow" might sound somewhat formal and stiff, to put it simply, children grow like bamboo shoots. Tokukichi and Kōsuke were already fifteen or sixteen years old, and since remaining as "oni-wakashū" (boys without adult hairstyles) seemed old-fashioned and improper, the Tokuemon couple took care of the matter and had both undergo the coming-of-age ceremony. At Kōsuke's request, he preferred to keep the name Kōsuke, so it remained unchanged. Meanwhile, Tokukichi was renamed Tokubei. Though he was a year younger, he understood shop matters well and showed promise in all things, so

he was first made an apprentice head clerk and was even allowed to imitate Tokuemon's manner of speaking.

"It suits you very well."

"It looks quite cold."

"Are you getting close to Toku-san and wanting to look stylish?"

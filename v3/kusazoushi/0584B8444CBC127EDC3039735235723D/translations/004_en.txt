In contrast to this, Tokukichi would make a hundred visits inside the house from morning to evening to confirm tasks, and would walk around with his hair as if he had been sweeping soot regularly, his ears and collar completely black.

Watching five or six neighborhood children playing with soap nuts, blowing bubbles, or playing kemari (kickball), he found it fascinating and thought "I would love to try that too," but he had no soap nuts.

For two or three days he kept an eye out, searching for soap nuts at storefronts along the street, and began trading. Fortunately, one soap nut became six or seven, and he carefully tucked the extras into his cloth waist-tuck, treasuring them so much that he would sleep while pressing them down. Eventually they increased by two, then three, and later became twenty or thirty. From this point, unfortunately, his heart turned to gambling.

Tokukichi applied himself earnestly even with just one unit of capital, taking care of each one, and if he worked hard he would profit. He devoted himself to this mindset, and while calculating his master's account books day and night, he found the concept of "profit-making methods" fascinating. Eventually, it came to be thought that this Tokukichi should be [the successor to] Tokuzaemon.

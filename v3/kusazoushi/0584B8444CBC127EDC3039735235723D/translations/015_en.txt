The course of human destiny is indeed ironic. Living a dissolute life, with a heart that understands competing in either royal pursuits or literary arts with passionate devotion, not proceeding patiently but hastily, when he thought "farewell," his beloved went astray. At the outskirts of Shinagawa, being captivated by a woman and thinking it amusing, his downfall came all at once. Now he has no place to rest even on the embankment, and though he and she cover themselves with a single piece of cloth, whether it be hachijō silk or island crepe, his vanity still does not cease. In the past, Fujiya Izaemon spent all his gold and silver on a woman named Yūgiri, was reduced to owning just a paper kimono, and left behind a bad reputation, saying "pursuing my desires beyond this point, I shall wear a straw mat," yet claiming to surpass Izaemon. "I am more of a ladies' man than Izaemon" - this alone became his consolation as resignation, and he spent his days receiving one or two sen from people.

Meanwhile, Tokuemon's household [text unclear], transferred the house, the couple retired, and it became Tokubei's estate. On the way back from worshipping at Sensoji Temple's Kanzeon, he encountered his former colleague Kōsuke and took him along, intending to help him.

"I am most grateful for that."

Hanakawa was madly in love with Tokimune, but knowing about his relationship with a courtesan from the second district, she sensed an opportunity for mediation and asked Yahata to come as an intermediary. Since Yahata was a well-known figure in the fifth district, he agreed and called Tokimune to Maizuru's parlor to make the request.

"Now, Toki-san, I hate to interrupt you at such an important moment, but that Hanakawa-san is completely infatuated and earnestly begs that you come to this gathering. Since I arranged the matter with the second district courtesan, please consider this a mediation. I know it may be unpleasant, but please do me this favor."

Being asked this way, Tokimune, who was currently being entertained, could not refuse Yahata outright and responded politely:

"Ah, Yahata-san acts as matchmaker - I am much obliged. I cannot disgrace Hanakawa-sama's reputation, nor can I ignore your words. I shall certainly agree to this."

Hanakawa, who had been listening from outside the soldiers' quarters, immediately sent a messenger, then leaning against her night clothes, spoke as if she both knew and didn't know about the courtesan situation: "I am just tonight's entertainment - afterward, my presence would surely be bothersome."

Tokimune, being a man of experience, responded skillfully and cleverly:

"How strange for Hanakawa-san to say such things. Since you have feelings about the second district matter, your kindness in trying to hide the courtesan affair is indeed thoughtful. People who haven't seen each other for a long time aren't usually like that. Depending on circumstances and character, one might cut ties with one place and settle with another house - that seems to be in your heart. As I just told Yahata-san, even someone like me, if Yukinari-san comes to Tora-san's place, and if you would just come, I would accommodate anything. When you feel like being a patron to the courtesans, please come thinking you'd like to socialize."

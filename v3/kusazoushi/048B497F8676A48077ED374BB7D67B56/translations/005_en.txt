Kobayashi Katsuyori, meeting Hachiman for the first time, had said "Please come with great haste," so today at the Ōmiya inn in Naka-no-chō, the three of them waited from noon for Hachiman to arrive. When he came shortly after, they all gathered formally and began to speak, mixing truth with fiction.

Asahina: "Thank you for coming so early. The person I spoke to you about is here. These brothers are like gods of poverty and are quite clumsy fellows, so we hope you will look after them for a long time to come, and eventually they would like an audience with the great lord - this is their earnest wish. It would be boorish to speak at length in this setting, but just as Master Asahina has stated, this is a matter of genuine potato digging, so please look favorably upon our request."

Hachiman: "Well, well, such polite greetings from you three gentlemen - I am truly honored. Having met once in such circumstances, our familiarity will increase a hundredfold. Since everything is encompassed within our small circle of affairs, come now, let us drink heartily."

Woman: "Suke-san seems more serious than usual today. Oh, Asa-san, I've finished with Maituru-san and Hanakawa-san. As for Tora-san, that's obvious - he should come out now."

Asahina: "Indeed, the three-finger nail-spreading gesture is quite strange. Hachiman-san, let's go now. Guide woman, go ahead - are you going to assign me another courtesan?"

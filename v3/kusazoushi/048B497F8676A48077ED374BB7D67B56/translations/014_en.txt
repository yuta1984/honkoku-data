Tora took Denzaemon's earnest teaching as truth and finally fled the pleasure quarters to come to Yukinari's mansion in Sugigashita, explaining in detail that she had come to request hairdressing services due to a doctor's recommendation. Yukinari, feeling Denzaemon's spirit as a man of the world, allowed Tora to stay in his mansion. However, Tora heard talk that people would investigate the circumstances due to rumors.

"If they were just making inquiries, they should come here directly, but investigating the Yamanote area doesn't make sense," she thought. Being the renowned Tora of Oiso, she astutely realized this was certainly a scheme to entrap her, capture her, cause trouble for Yukinari, and extort money at the magistrate's office, so she consulted with Yukinari.

"Hearing the rumors, I've been thinking - it appears to be a plot to forcibly capture me, cause you trouble, and extort money. To counter this, assign someone to escort me back to Oiso-ya now. If you say that it's difficult to keep a courtesan who fled from Oiso and send me back, they can't refuse. Since I was taught by my patron, they can't subject me to punishment, and since I showed signs of wanting to escape and couldn't be taken to Naka-no-cho, when they're at a loss, if you ask the Kamakura-mae people for help, you won't be troubled."

An urgent letter came from Hanakawa to Tokimune's place. When he opened it, it read: "The letter I was to send to you, master, was mistakenly sent to a guest at Odawara-ya. The guest became furious and demanded that you be killed, so thinking to obtain clothing first, I gave that response. Please provide reimbursement for the Ebisu festival preparations. I apologize for making such selfish requests." The reimbursement for preparations from that side belongs to Tokimune.

"If this kind of theatrical scheme works, that's fine."

"Indeed, that's probably right. I'll send Danzaburo right away, so you should go."

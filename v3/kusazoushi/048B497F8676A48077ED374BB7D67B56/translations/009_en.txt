Thanks to Asahina's great assistance from the beginning, the brothers successfully completed their audience with Suketsune, and they were determined not to let Hachiman Taro escape this time.

For the hunt at the foot of Mount Fuji, since Kudo was appointed as the field magistrate, they positioned themselves to become assistant magistrates, planning to successfully achieve their eighteen-year-long desire for revenge against their father's enemy. Regardless of what people might say or think, they didn't care at all. Taking to heart the lesson of Han Xin crawling between a man's legs as an example of enduring temporary humiliation, they met with Suketsune, and on their way back from their official appointment, they went to Hachiman Taro's residence, inquired about his mood, requested an audience, and paid their respects.

"Sir retainer, when you return, please tell him: We are most pleased that you continue to serve with great vigor and health. First of all, this morning's audience with the great lord went very well, and we are most grateful for your patronage. As thanks for this, Juro and Goro have come to visit your residence. Please mention this to him when he returns home."

The attendant agreed to convey this message properly.

"My master will return home after the eighth hour (around 2-3 PM), so I will inform him at that time."

Now, Tokimune's scheming letter arrived directly from the Odawara-ya as planned, so Chuuta thought it was the usual letter and opened it. Finding something different about it, he gradually read through and discovered it contained instructions to have clothes made by servants at the Odawara-ya, and was a letter addressed to "Kisa," a childhood name, meant for "Toki-sama." Chuuta flew into a great rage and, without taking anything with him, came rushing to Hanakawa's place. Unable to calm his violently beating heart, he declared he was canceling their arrangement for the promised clothing, which surprised Hanakawa.

"What's this nonsense? Chuuta-san, this seems like a sudden whim. Well, what's the matter? Did someone lend you money again, or what? This isn't like you at all. No wonder things seemed strange in Naka-no-cho. If there's some reason, tell me."

"This has nothing to do with pots and pans. Look at this letter that was in your heart," he said, producing it. When she opened it and saw it was a love letter sent to Tokimune's place, she was startled and wondered what to do. Realizing it must have been switched when she had it sealed at the incense burner, and seeing that he had discovered it, she thought desperately of stabbing Chuuta. But realizing that would leave her without means to obtain clothing for the upcoming Ebisu festival, she decided to first say she would kill Tokimune, take the clothing, and then figure out how to escape afterward. So she declared she would kill Tokimune and managed to smooth over the situation for the moment.

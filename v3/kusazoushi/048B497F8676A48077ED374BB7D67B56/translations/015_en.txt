From there, Danzaburo put Tora in a palanquin and brought her back to Oiso-ya with the intention of returning her, speaking the lines as planned. Even the experienced Denzaemon was so astonished that he couldn't refuse to take her back. Though he had taught her to "run away," he didn't punish her as usual, and this annoying, exaggerated, vulgar theatrical performance damaged his valuable commodity, so like a bay horse, he calmed his fury.

"Regarding our courtesan Tora, she fled from Oiso and took refuge in your mansion."

"What an increasingly insolent courtesan! I shall certainly order punishment."

"Without regard for this being a samurai residence, for a courtesan to come here is most unreasonable and outrageous conduct."

"Now, Miss Tora, there's no need to cry. That's just your nature. From now on, you should become a room-keeper or entertainer and try to acquire a bit more refinement and discrimination."

"Nurturing 
the flower-blooming
old man,
every day
making daily visits
with devotion,
living in
peace"

The monkey, by its own hand, not eating/wearing, made excuses about money with its friend the crab, and because I said "my dance, my dance," even now people say monkeys are cunning. We too, solely through the miraculous power of Kannon, though we may be burned, the foul smell is not too terrible - carrying toothpick seeds on our backs.

The monkey that was nurtured - because of this monkey, even now toothpick shop signs display monkeys, which began from that original time.

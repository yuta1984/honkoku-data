Well then, with a "Chin-tsun-chin," Kobayashi no Saburo-hei, following the teachings of Asai Nagamasa, had been touring islands as his heart desired, but when he awoke from his dream, he found himself in Great Japan. Neither the long-legged ones nor the long-armed ones were anywhere to be found. Whether it be the ways of women or the ways of men, there was not a single thing that was disagreeable.

Please view the conditions of the islands as if awakening from the sleep of a pagoda, like the treasure ship dream of the second day of the New Year, and have a good laugh - this I humbly present with deep respect.

Saburōhei said,
"Though I don't know
the name of this island,
without asking, one can tell
it must be Tenaga
(Long-arm) Island.
For things, it's an extremely
good country.

However, in Japan and such places,
without buyers,
people's discarded things,
single people and such—
when they feel the urge to urinate,
a day doesn't pass.
Whether it's enviable
or disagreeable,
meal times
and such amusements—
reaching out hands to each other
like sticks,
going about searching for things,
it's like passing through a festival.

There's still
a little
hishi (water chestnut)
salt
left."

Here there is a man called Saburōhei of Kobayashi.
He is always easygoing and not uncouth.
Usually in the neighborhood, for sake at Ōhara, he easily looks down on those who have just "two or three" [cups],
thinking that about one kin [bottle] is reasonable.
He likes to drink somewhat seriously,
and though he cannot survive on hard things alone,
when he starts reading jōruri books and such
and dozes off drowsily,
his loud snoring that continues
is truly the work of a sake bottle.

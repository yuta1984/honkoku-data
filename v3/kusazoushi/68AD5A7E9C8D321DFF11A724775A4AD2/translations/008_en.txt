Saburō-hei crossed to Ashinaga Island, appearing to be the local steward, accompanied by a tremendous entourage, saying "What a magnificent sight!"

Wearing formal court dress with sleeves,
having large drums carried behind,

Though Saburō-hei was utterly amazed, those around him were walking on the main road. Stepping with their feet, among the thousand dew-meetings in the countryside, remembering his daughter, shedding tears as he watched, everything became round again.

Just crossing the great sea on foot made even one day unbearable, so he quickly departed for the Moon Island.

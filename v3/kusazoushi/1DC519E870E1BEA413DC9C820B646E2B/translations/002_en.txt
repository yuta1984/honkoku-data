Ninth year of An'ei, Year of the Rat

【Upper Section】
Here in a place called Matsukawa Village
there lived an old
white fox, whose daughter was
called Misaki,
this year sixteen years old, in her flower
of youth. Even for the countryside,
she was regrettably
beautiful
in appearance.
Recently
from Yanaka
an adopted son came,
called Kinugasa Mori-
no-jō.
He too was an old
amorous fox
from way back, and though
Misaki and he had not yet
held their wedding
ceremony, since they
loved each other mutually, they lived
together harmoniously.
Lately this Mori-no-jō has been
acting like a man of the world
or some such fashion, going out every single night.
He surely goes to no decent places.
Someone should give him a talking-to.

Shop clerk Kurōsuke:
"That's surely the case.
Let me give him some
advice."

"If that's so,
I too
think the same.
In any case, we should quickly hold the wedding
ceremony and have him
settle down.
That's what we should do."

Now, Shakushi Nyorai (Ladle Buddha) had something to consider, and although the silver tea kettle should have appeared in a dream, being busy, he sent out the flint and steel that had previously touched his hands as substitutes. Therefore, these fire-making tools appeared in the gold tea kettle's dream and spoke thus:

♪"Now, all the previous matters have been settled. From now on, you must curb your extravagance somewhat. You who were treasured for a thousand years at Higashiyama Palace became proud, and have now ransomed out the small gold kettle. Even if you were to ransom out two or three courtesans, with your wealth it wouldn't be much of a financial blow, but that wouldn't satisfy your sense of duty. You probably think we fire-making tools growing old in a tinderbox are cowards, but even one who rules a million koku of rice sits on the same single tatami mat. Though we too live in humble circumstances, our heart's joy is no different from yours. Even if you become like someone who wears rags but decorates with brocade, take shame not from appearance but from the heart. If you abandon your prideful heart from now on and make frugality your first priority, your descendants will prosper for generations without doubt. We absolutely guarantee this."

How about that, young masters of the world - please forgive us!

Here there is another kettle called "Bunbuku Chagama" (Lucky Tea Kettle). Also known as "Tonda Chagama" (Flying Tea Kettle), this is a kettle that a thousand-year-old tanuki (raccoon dog) transformed into, which is well known to people. However, when Kogane no Kama (Golden Kettle), who had fallen into dissolute ways, was frequenting the neighborhood and spending all her time day and night in the Yoshiwara pleasure quarter, she heard that Kogane no Kama would soon be ransomed by Kin no Chagama (Gold Tea Kettle). Though she felt regretful, since she had no money to ransom her herself, she teamed up with the worst scoundrel and enlisted "Udon-ya no Tokkuri" (Udon Shop's Sake Flask), a playboy, and on a moonlit night, they stole Kogane no Kama.
Truly an outrageous act!

Now, Tonda Chagama (Flying Tea Kettle) enlisted companions including Udon-ya no Tokkuri (Udon Shop's Sake Flask) and Kappa-ya no Surikogi (Kappa Shop's Pestle), and on a moonlit night, they snuck into the quarters of a fallen courtesan and easily stole Kogane no Kama (Golden Kettle), hiding her deep in his lodging and caring for her tenderly morning and evening. However, her heart would not turn to him at all, and she remained devoted to Gin no Chagama (Silver Tea Kettle), so Bunbuku Chagama could no longer bear it and, using a pleasure boat excursion as pretext, went out to Ryogoku River intending to torment Kogane no Kama to death.

♪On Kin no Chagama's [Gin no Chagama's] side, worried about not knowing Kogane no Kama's whereabouts, he ordered Soba-choko (Soba Cup) and Chawan (Tea Bowl) to search for Kogane's location.

Chawan disguised himself in various ways to find Kogane no Kama, and today, becoming a monkey trainer, he went out on a boat. On a houseboat moored opposite, he spotted Kogane no Kama in distress, and without revealing who he was, made various apologies and finally bought her for a thousand ryo in gold.

[Chawan's dialogue]
♪Then, I shall exchange it for this ohaguro pot containing money and some white goods.

[Right page indented dialogue by Bunbuku]
♪How detestable I thought this was, but having a buyer is fortunate. If it's a thousand ryo, that's not a bad price at all.

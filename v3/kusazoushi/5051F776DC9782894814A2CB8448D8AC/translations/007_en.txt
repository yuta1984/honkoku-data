Now our pot returned home with the golden kettle in tow, thinking "this must be some fine goods that will bring good profit," and dressed it in a large Japanese-style furisode kimono to hide it. However, the wife and husband became jealous of each other and began quarreling loudly, escalating into a big fight. When a mortar and pestle rushed in to break it up, they wouldn't listen. The pot stubbornly tried to divorce his wife, but the mortar calmed him down saying, "What's essential is that a pot can cook things precisely because it has a lid. Please consider this carefully."

When told this, he finally understood that indeed, just as there must be a bottom, there must also be a lid, and he was convinced and calmed down.

♪"That pot intends to sell the golden kettle as a courtesan, having already sent people ahead to the brothels and teahouses of Yoshiwara, so immediately only the masters come for consultations."
♪"In general, even in the world, the relationship between our pot and its tight-fitting lid is one of constant quarrels, and every time they fight, not a single benefit comes of it. Such behavior is never found among those who follow the path of frugality. One should be careful."

♪The golden kettle had become a freeloader in this place, but again felt sorry for the marital quarrel and said:

♪"If it were other people's quarrels, I'd smash them up myself first!"

♪"Get out and disappear quickly! While you're here, should we go without eating stewed eggplant?"

♪"What did you say?" When this was said, our pot raised its voice: "Shut up, you don't even know when the damn thing is cooked!"

♪"This is quite presumptuous! Enough, enough, behave yourselves!"

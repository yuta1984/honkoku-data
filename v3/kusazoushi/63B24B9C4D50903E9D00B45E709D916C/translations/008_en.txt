The Chinese people
are becoming more and more
sophisticated connoisseurs.
However, things from China
are considered
vulgar,
they say stylishly.
Gradually, even their kosode robes
are made with
daimyo-striped patterns,
siskin tea color,
square-linked patterns,
chrysanthemum longevity patterns,
and such.
As for books too,
they only buy Japanese works,
saying Chinese books
are vulgar,
and cast them aside.
For calligraphy practice,
they abandon Chinese style and practice
Oie-ryu,
Nagao, Sayama styles, and others.
However, the genuine
Nanban dye doesn't catch on
because it gets confused
with that other dye
from over there.

This Japanese desk—
where on earth did you
buy it? How
terrifying!

Meanwhile,
the way of connoisseurship
becomes increasingly precious, and all the Chinese people
adopt Honda-style topknots,
requesting to be made into young men (yarō)
for burning incense—it's as if they want
to enter the Buddhist path and become monks.
Seeing this, one cannot tell
whether it's the Buddhist way
or the Confucian way—
this is the teaching of the
way of connoisseurship.
Many Chinese
young men
are created.

Namu-kie-tsū (Hail, take refuge in connoisseurship)
Namu-sanpō (Hail, three treasures)
Namu-kie-buki (Hail, take refuge in weapons)
Chant these prayers.

For a fine young man's bearing,
you must not
shave your beard—
it's for when you
stroke it.

Today's Honda
turned out
splendidly.

Now then,
teacher,
are you still waiting
for the brush
to...?

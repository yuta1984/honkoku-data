A Chinese creditor who was owed money came secretly to collect debts, but being a great connoisseur Chinese, he thought "Probably the master will pretend to be away," so from outside he called "Ma'am, is your master away?" The wife was about to say "That's not true," but thinking it would be "un-connoisseur-like" to respond directly to his pointed question, she said "Yes, well, he's something like away, but you know, you should also say 'yoshikauun.'"

When she said "yoshika, yoshika," the debt collector also said "Oh, I understand. Yoshisa, yoshisa" and returned home—this is a foolish story well-suited to the connoisseur lifestyle.

[Dialogue]
"Being too much of a connoisseur is also foolish. He owes me a considerable debt."

"On my way back, should I also go collect from the rice shop?"

[Many parts throughout are unclear]

If one is a sage,
then there's the qilin (Chinese unicorn).
If one is a teetotaler,
then there's sweet rice wine. If one is a connoisseur,
then it would be
something like
this.

The Chinese people, on their way back
from the lecture,
hurry to the western
lumber yard where horses gather.
In the age of sages,
qilin appear.
In the age of connoisseurs,
there are things like horses appearing suddenly.
The Chinese people are increasingly
impressed that Kōshi
is truly a connoisseur.

At this rate, rather than a qilin,
a rhinoceros will
appear.

Until now, I had been licking
at the bottom of the sea (paper?).
How strange, how strange!

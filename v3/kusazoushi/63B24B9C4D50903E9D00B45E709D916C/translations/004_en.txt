Now, with the great king of Morokoshi (China) wishing to summon the connoisseurs, about a thousand great connoisseurs were to come to Japan. What a sight - the Chinese people set up viewing stands, and the number of people coming out to see the connoisseurs was tremendous. They turned their banners upside down and carried flags reading "Seitō" (World-Appropriate).

Like flying mouths

of heart is for the

If one keeps falling over, such a fashion won't last long.

Because people fell and were laughed at while wearing these geta, in today's world this is called "geta-geta laughter." Also, the expression "what a ridiculous thing" comes from this incident.

"Good walking is with zōri, falling is with geta, eh?"
[A pun where "anyo" plays on "jōzu" (skillful) and "zōri" (sandals), while "falling" plays on "heta" (clumsy) and "geta" (wooden clogs)]

Connoisseurs here heard from China that women wear zōri with three or five layers of backing, and men wear wide-brimmed hiyori-geta. In a world where people exaggerate small matters to great proportions, they made the backing twenty layers thick and the geta as thick as wooden boards to wear. Little do they know how much both men and women fall! No matter how fashionable something may be, foolish parents want to make their daughters try wearing them. But would parents really be pleased to see their daughters falling? Could there be such fathers even in China?

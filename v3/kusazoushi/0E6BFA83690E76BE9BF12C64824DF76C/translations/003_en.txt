As you know, the great nyūdō (monk-spirit) of Echigo province had an only son whom he called "One-Eyed Boy" and cherished greatly. Since this boy was as skilled at shapeshifting as his parent, many monsters said to the nyūdō: "One-Eyed Lord has now become accomplished in the art of transformation, so nyūdō should retire and pass the world over to One-Eye." Therefore, the nyūdō, following his companions' recommendation, gouged out his own single eye and gave it to the boy, renamed himself "One-Eye Monk," and withdrew from the world to live in seclusion.

The boy inherited control of the world, but though he could taste it, unlike in the old days, monsters have now become corrupt and are hard to consume.

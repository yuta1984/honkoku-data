【Continued】Princess Minatsuki emerges, and a retainer of Ōmi Kotōda comes forth, falsely claiming to be Honda, and says: "Ah, what good fortune to meet you here. I understand you have long been devoted to Sukenari and have been caring for his child. My master Shigetada has found Jūrō and will offer persuasive counsel for him to follow your wishes, then return this child and have Tora-gozen sever her ties. Please hand him over." Thinking this was true, Minatsuki says "Oh, how grateful I am to Shigetada-sama" and takes the child's hand to pass him over. Ōmi says "Got him!" and cradles the child under his arm as he runs off.

Tora-gozen, taking advantage of her disguise as a young man, blocks his path and declares: "I am one called Honda no Otodo Saburō Chikaie. You villain who falsely used my brother's name to steal away this child! I suspect you are Kotōda, retainer of Kudō!" "Oh, clever deduction! I'm taking the son of Sukenari, who targets my master as an enemy, as a hostage. Now stand aside!" Seeing the danger, Jūrō and Gorō draw their swords together and engage in combat. Princess Minatsuki is startled and flees inside with her pages.

Without any difficulty, the brothers capture and subdue Kotōda. "Since you shot down our father Kawazu, you are indeed our true enemy. Prepare yourself!" Even before finishing these words, they strike off his head. They have Tora-gozen hold the child, and the brothers return together with Shōshō, rejoicing triumphantly.

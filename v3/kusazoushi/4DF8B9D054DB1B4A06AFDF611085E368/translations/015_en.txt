"How ridiculous! If it were leek miso, it would go well with hot tofu, but butterbur miso - what a dull supernatural creature!" he laughs, when suddenly another figure appears - over ten feet tall, a mist-haired demon child wearing a cow-pattern kimono, holding a large sake cup. What appears to be an iron club covered with bumps is actually the leg of an octopus over ten feet long that he's dragging along. Standing tall, he declares, "I shall drink a cup with this as my appetizer." So Shuten-dōji is a supernatural creature of sake? With sake as the theme, there should be more interesting ways to transform.

"Think a bit more creatively. You're lacking in ingenuity," he says, whereupon the demon extends his hand, saying "I'll take the leg" - a pun on octopus appetizer.

"What's the answer?" "How obvious!" responds Kyūdayū. "And the meaning?" "All legs and no backbone [no spirit, no composure]."

"Let me try one. Yura-no-suke - what does this riddle mean?" "Are you slightly drunk?" "No, no - the answer is 'mountain retreat.'" "Ah, the meaning is someone who rejoices as if he'd taken an enemy's head when he's taken a demon's head?" "No, you're still just tipsy. Now, Yura the wealthy merchant - what's the answer?" "Shōki the wealthy merchant." "And the meaning?" "Demon-killer sake?" "Exactly!"

At this moment, when a hanging scroll of Shōki is suddenly opened, the demon child immediately loses his true form and becomes a demon spirit over ten feet tall, saying "That sake barrel of pickled radish in the firewood shed over there is an empty barrel of demon-killer sake, and though its lingering essence emits the toxic vapors of evil odors, I am overcome with fear by Shōki's divine power and cannot remain in this household - demons outside!" and flees.

At that moment, an elegant woman's figure appears. She wears a thick front sash, a small-sleeved kimono of striped seiraisu (seratus) crepe, lined with black satin, with intermediate garments of quail leather layered one over the other, and the hem is quite full. For a ghost, there's too much hem. Her face suggests she's of good age but has no children.

"Could this be an ubume (birthing spirit)?" he says, and she replies: "Even the interest accumulating in my belly, barely waiting through tea time, flowing accounts like foam bubbles - these are pitiful, transient borrowed clothes. I am a vain and slovenly woman, a lost soul in trailing robes. The chief guard only from the hem down, though it appears to be two layered intermediate garments, with only hem-wrapping and cotton-stuffed puppet construction - if you were to see this, your liver would be crushed and you'd faint. The side pieces are three-colored with enhanced hues. I'd like to say it's past noon, but it's around 2-3 AM. This is what we call a true clothing ghost."

"Wait, indeed, a clothing ghost must be quite intimate with costume design - what an artful, sophisticated apparition. Let's see what kind of face you have."

When he says this, she removes her hood. Her head is that of a beautiful deceiver, but her face is that of an old woman - oh, how frightening! "What a strange ghost! How liver-crushing - rather unbecoming of a lady!"

"In this world, since humans dress up as ghosts, real ghosts must flee naked."
"That's why New Year's Eve is scarier than ghosts." "Why?" "Well, since it's an all-nighter, ghosts won't appear, but people's faces look long, short, and frightening - don't you think?"

"Using New Year's Eve as a theme, why don't you transform into a debt collector for rice, sake, side dishes, miso, and firewood? There's nothing scarier than a bill collector."
"Well then, I'll transform and show you, but since you say I'd be frightening, why—" she says, and he replies, "You're a female debt collector!" She vanishes in agitation.

"Wait, indeed a female debt collector would be frightening." Having set the theme, he wonders what will appear and gazes at the garden. "At what hour does the snow continue to fall heavily?" Looking at the lantern, there's wind, and he hums "night snow."

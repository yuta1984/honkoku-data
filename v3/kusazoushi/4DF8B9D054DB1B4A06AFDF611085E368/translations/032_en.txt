[Continued] Drawing together the sleeves of his plain robe, he crouched quietly in concealment.

There Yoshimori and Suketsune came together, bringing with them Egara no Heita and many other samurai. "What manner of men are these on foot? Tonight we would entertain this lord Suketsune at Oiso. This is a secret path - just pass through as you are," they say. Suketsune bows with his hands on the ground: "How unusual, Lord Yoshimori. These are the Soga brothers." Hearing this, [Yoshimori] nods with satisfaction. "This is fortunate. Come to Oiso and arrange everything." "Not at all, Lord Suketsune. They are Kawazu's memento, the Soga brothers. Goro may not yet recognize you. This here is Lord Suketsune - make his acquaintance," Yoshimori urges. Suketsune smiles and says, "So these are those impoverished Soga brothers? They even come and go from my estate. Let the dog-servant take some old bowls and old sticks as charity." He speaks mockingly.

Kiba no Tokimune tries to leap at him, but Suketsune restrains him. "What excellent greetings! I shall indeed call upon you," he says with words of patronage to Wada no Yoshimori. "Before the night grows late, Lord Suketsune." "Farewell." "Until later." "Brothers, you follow as well," they say, heading toward Oiso and passing by.

"Damn you Suketsune, I won't let you escape!" Goro Tokimune tries to dash out again. "Wait, brother! If we achieve our purpose now, it will bring trouble to Lord Yoshimori. Can't you see that?" he admonishes. Then Egara no Heita returns from the pleasure house: "I invited you brothers so that Lord Tokimune could memorize Kudo's features, watch for an opportunity, and strike down the enemy - this has been Yoshimori's intention all along. First, come to the pleasure house," and he leads them away in haste.

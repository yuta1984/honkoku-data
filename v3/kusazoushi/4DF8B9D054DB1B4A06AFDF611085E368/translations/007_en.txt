《Title: Picture of a Chinese Woman (Kara-onna) Ghost》

Here there was a gesaku writer
called Sharakusai.
Escaping from the
stereotypical patterns
of popular serial novels,
seeking something even more
【To left page】
"non-frightening monsters" as his
concept, he leaned against his desk
thinking and
fell asleep. In his dream, he saw a young attendant (kamuro)
with her hair elaborately done up with
flower hairpins, looking heavy-headed, carrying
a food delivery box as she walked. This resembled
an old akahon story: "On a drizzly rainy night,
a boy goes out to buy tofu, borrowing an umbrella.
When asked 'How much tofu did you buy?'
he replies 'I bought half a block, sir.'
'Well then, become that half block!'
'And so, happily ever after.'" At this point, why must
some auspicious monster appear? Troubled by this problem,
someone says: "Oh my, an auspicious monster - that's a new edition indeed!
When it becomes a book, madam, we'll use it
as a model for something."
"Are you going to transform too?
This time's monster is a clever one.
I intend to show Chinese monsters."
"Oh, if it's Chinese monsters,
it'll be gibberish - we
won't understand it." "I'm an author too, but
I don't know what Chinese
monsters are like."
"Rather than such gibberish
monsters, it would be better to gently
write about tofu ghosts
or something." Just as he thought this, he awoke
from his dream, and only the tofu seller's
delivery box remained at hand.
This is the tofu ghost▲

▲Should be called a Chinese
monster, and so making this
the title of this
booklet. If it were all a dream,
the author's
achievement would be thin.
Having the dream end from
the beginning is
novel, but
ultimately
difficult to handle - thus
he pondered deeply
while plotting
the story.
Just then,
suddenly
from beneath
the veranda,
an arm as large
as a sumo wrestler's
extended forth.

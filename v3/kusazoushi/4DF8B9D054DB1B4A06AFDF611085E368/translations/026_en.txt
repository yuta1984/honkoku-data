【Continued】"Come now, please drink," he said, offering the water. "What's this? I have my own servant with me - why should I ask anything of you?" "How strange! To turn such kindness to water [waste] is incomprehensible," and Shōshō stepped forward to intervene. "Ah, what a disagreeable master! Whether man or woman, what does it matter?" When this was said, [Tokimune replied] "You scoundrels, you cannot remain here any longer," and forcibly led Gorō away.

"What an arrogant young gentleman! Ah, this commotion has ruined everything. I'm soaked with water," muttered Jūrō. Tora sat down heavily: "Ah, how tiresome! These swords are so heavy I can't bear it. I hate this young man's disguise." Jūrō approached her and said, "We disguise ourselves this way because we want to find our child's whereabouts. Please be patient." Just then, servants and retainers came out from the small gate, and Misogi ran out saying, "Hey there, Sakubei the well-digger! As we've been saying lately, if Master Jūrō's child should come to this mansion, he might well come looking. Please be careful," and went back inside. Sakubei nodded.

Hearing him say "Well then, let me get to work by the well," Sukenari rejoiced: "Excuse me, that Jūrō and I are friends. If that's the case, shall I bring him to the mansion right now? If that child is not Master Jūrō's child, it would indeed be pitiful. I know him well too - might I have a quick look at the child?" "Oh, then I'll put on this work coat and you can say Sakubei is your assistant. I have business to attend to, so please take care of things here for a bit." Saying this, he went inside. Just as Jūrō was rejoicing at this heaven-sent opportunity, Tokimune emerged carrying cooper's tools. "Ah! You're that rikoppō fellow from before!" "And you're that servant from before!" "Well, I'm just a day laborer hired for well-digging, but I don't understand how a rikoppō performer can be a cooper." [Tokimune] replied, "Well, why hide it? I've been disowned by my mother, and though I want to appeal to Lord Yoshimori, the master of this mansion, to help me apologize to my mother, I have no way to approach him, so I work as a cooper..." 【Continued】

"How ridiculous! Even if it was a supernatural creature, I thought I'd have a taste of that first bonito. I don't need mustard miso, but I'd like some leek miso for hot tofu," he thinks, when suddenly the apparition of a maiden from Dōjōji appears. Why would Dōjōji become miso-topped sake, you wonder, but she sings a temari song.

[Continuation] "Bon festival rice cakes, tastier than four-mon rice cakes. With sweet adzuki beans and sweet kinako powder, forcing down a hasty meal. This is truly eating - hi, fu, mi, yo. Ten-tsu-tsu-tsun, ten-tsu-tsu, ten-tsu-tsu-tsun." As she dances to this rhythm, her wig falls off, and the maiden becomes a monk, the monk becomes a young man, chanting "Come quickly, year-end bill collector, northern direction, ten-tsu-tsu," dancing wildly into the darkness.

"How absurd! Wait, wait! You creatures are far too frivolous supernatural beings. Of all the songs available, 'Rice Cake Dōjōji' - what boorish fellows! That first bonito supernatural creature that just appeared was much more clever," he says. They respond, "Clever ka-ka-ka?" "Clever ka-ka-ka - does that mean mustard miso? Like mustard written by a simpleton, it has absolutely no bite at all. That's why you performed such a dull kyōgen play. Are you simpletons with butterbur miso?" he asks. "Yes, yes, we are indeed the spirits of those butterbur sprouts," they say, and brazenly enter the house.

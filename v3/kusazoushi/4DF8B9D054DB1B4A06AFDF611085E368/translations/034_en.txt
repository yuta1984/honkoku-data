Thus, when the Soga brothers appeared in the parlor of the pleasure house, Yoshimori was in good spirits and said, "I hear you two are skilled at kyōgen. You two should perform the kyōgen of Hanako to entertain Lord Suketsune." Sukenari answered, "The kyōgen called Hanako requires three actors - a daimyo, Tarō the blacksmith, and the mountain god (wife) - with the female roles totaling three brothers performing together, but we would be short two actors for the female parts." Upon hearing this, Saemon Suketsune had a flash of inspiration: "For those female parts, I have someone here who should be kept for that purpose, so prepare quickly." Upon hearing this, the brothers stood up from their seats, with Sukenari preparing as the daimyo and Tokimune as Tarō the blacksmith, and they set out with their costumes ready.

[Kyōgen dialogue] "Is Tarō the blacksmith there?" "I tell you, since I haven't been visiting Lady Hanako recently, I deceived the mountain god at home by saying I would meditate for seventeen days. You should put on this meditation screen and sit in meditation. I shall visit Lady Hanako to relieve the frustration I've built up recently. If the mountain god comes and says anything, don't speak. I was about to say I'm going out but returned, saying 'Whether going or returning, the mountain god is very troublesome, so be careful' - without revealing they were enemies." Tokimune nodded, "Please don't worry at all." "Then I'm relieved. Now, let me go to Lady Hanako," and he went into the inner room.

○Lady Tora was assigned to play the mountain god role and appeared in formal overgarment attire. "My lord has been meditating for seventeen days, taking neither hot water nor cold water, but since this seems too austere, I thought I'd observe from a distance. What's this - you won't say anything properly and just shake your head around. Well, let me remove this screen. Oh, I thought it was my lord, but what are you doing here?" "Ah, how sad, the lord has gone to Lady Hanako. There's nothing to be done, so I'm doing this," she said, pursuing and gazing at his face. ○"Who do I think this mountain god is? It's that beast of a courtesan Tora! How dare you abandon your duty to your elder brother!" Yoshimori cut this off, saying, "Now, Tokimune, such words are never heard in the Hanako kyōgen," and being scolded, Gorō had no choice but to rub his arm and withdraw.

Tora sidled up: "Then put this meditation screen on me and leave me here. I have something I want to say to the lord from afar," she said tearfully. Gorō Tokimune replied, "Oh, do whatever you want," throwing the screen at Tora and kicking up the tatami as he went inside.

○In a switch, Sukenari appeared with Kamegiku's formal kosode draped over his shoulder, his voice languid as he sang a popular song: "The cords beneath the brocaded silk have come undone, how very improper." ○"Oh, Tarō the blacksmith, you must have been waiting impatiently. Why don't you speak? First I went there and knocked gently on the sliding door, and Lady Hanako said 'Who is it?' ○Just when rumors were already spreading, she said 'Who goes there knocking so insistently?' This kosode is also a keepsake from Lady Hanako, but if the mountain god sees it, she'll be furious." As he was speaking, Lady Tora pushed aside the screen and clung to Sukenari's chest: "I recognize this kosode - it belongs to Kamegiku. 'If the mountain god sees it she'll be furious' - what kind of snide remark directed at me is that? Just when rumors are spreading - ah, the scandalous reputation that arose came to this Tora before Lady Himegiku," she said with tearful resentment. Suketsune became greatly displeased: "Using the kyōgen as a pretext for your foolish complaints - I don't want to see it. Stop this, let's change rooms and drink again. Lord Yoshimori, please join us too," and he forcibly dragged Tora away as everyone went inside together.

[In the current kyōgen, things would indeed change accordingly. From here it becomes the inner chamber of the pleasure house.]

○Lady Tora called out her elder sister Kaze, who was being held in reserve: "Sister, I have a lifelong request," but she was only half-listening: "Again with your schemes! The wound on my little finger from recently still throbs and won't stop hurting, and now you want me to..." Pulling back the one trying to leave: "No, no, it's not that kind of thing. As you well know, Suketsune's infatuation with me - I've made it appear that my heart follows his wishes only to make him let down his guard so that your brothers can take revenge on their enemy. Tonight he insists on embracing me and sleeping with me, and he's prepared a bed over there waiting, so I had the young attendant extinguish the lights saying it would be embarrassing if there were light. When I give the signal, please quickly take my place," she pleaded. From behind the folding screen came Suketsune's voice: "Lady Tora, is Tora there?" "Yes, I'm coming there," she said, forcibly pushing her sister Kaze behind the screen, and just as she breathed a sigh of relief, the Soga brothers changed their costumes, suddenly pushed open the screen and cried out: "Saemon Suketsune, our father's enemy, prepare yourself!" "Oh, how terrible!" cried Kaze as she fled. Suketsune grabbed his sword: "You impertinent starving rōnin, I'll cut you down in return!" he said, dancing forward, but they paid no heed, parrying and engaging in combat. The first sword stroke was from the elder brother Sukenari, the second from the younger brother Tokimune, and they easily struck down Kudō and rejoiced together, which was only natural. When Wada no Yoshimori heard this and came running with his soldiers, the brothers threw down their swords: "Having achieved our long-cherished desire... [continues]"

【Continued】After telling of their disguises, a lady emerges from behind. Princess Minatsuki, together with Himuro-no-mae, carefully compares Gorō's face with a portrait, saying, "You are the living image of this portrait I fell in love with. Could it be you?" As she approaches, Gorō is startled and tries to flee, but Jūrō restrains him, saying, "That must be Lord Yoshimori's daughter. What perfect fortune for asking her to help with our petition for forgiveness of our banishment," and forcibly pushes him forward. Looking at Jūrō's face, she says with joy, "Indeed, you have spoken so earnestly and come searching," and Himuro-no-mae and the pages emerge from within, saying "Come, come this way," and forcibly invite the brothers inside.

○In the meantime, Tora slips in secretly and easily steals away her child, saying joyfully, "My dear boy, I have endured such hardships just to see you." Just then Shōshō overhears and says, "That young gentleman from before - somehow you speak like a woman." "And you too move like a woman." "I am a courtesan called Ai-Shōshō." "Then the one you came with must have been Tokimune-san. I am called Tora of Ōiso. The one I came with is Sukenari-san." "Ah, so that's it!" says Shōshō in surprise. "Damn it, this petition for forgiveness isn't getting anywhere," mutters Tokimune as he emerges. "Excuse me, Gorō-san, this person is the famous Tora-gozen. She has disguised herself as a servant, but she is your elder brother." Hearing this, Gorō is utterly astonished. "I've heard the situation," says Sukenari, coming out. "Listen, Gorō, since we haven't met since you were three or five years old, we don't know each other's faces." "How formal our earlier greeting was." "Brother!" "Younger brother! How I've longed for you!" They take each other's hands and rejoice together, which is only natural.

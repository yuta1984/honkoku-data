I remained in a dazed state. The bees still
Dance at the eaves like a person
Who has returned from the Kingdom of Huai'an.
Thus the master has recently been
Copying and painting figures from the Water Margin.
Looking at a certain volume,
When opened, all the people I had dreamed of were
Found within the pages. Therefore, during sleep I must
Have been wandering within these paintings. Recently

A certain bookseller wished to carve these into woodblocks
And publish them widely in the world. Sekien
Finally consented and had me write the preface.
Since I am a friend detached from worldly affairs, there is no need
To decline, so I take up my brush and write thus:
　　　Setchūan Ryōta
[Two seals]

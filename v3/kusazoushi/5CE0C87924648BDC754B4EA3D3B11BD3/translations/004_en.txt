As drowsiness frequently overcame me,
From the beehive at the eaves, three, four, then two bees
Invaded my ears, and though I brushed them away they would not leave. Like the person who
Drew his sword to drive away flies, thinking "now is just such a time,"
I took up a staff with the boy and
Struck at the nest to drive them away.
Then countless bees flew about in confusion and instantly
Transformed into human forms. Their appearance resembled small

Puppets. There were warriors and beautiful women,
Wise men and fools, and some monks too.
They spoke well, and in all their movements and activities
They embodied all the good and evil of the world.
"How strange!" I thought, resting my elbow on the desk,
Gazing intently, when later I was startled by Sekien saying
"I have just returned home."
When I awoke, I had been using a book as my pillow.

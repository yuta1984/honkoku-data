As has been said since ancient times,
"Even the judgment of hell depends on money."
For a thousand years in hell,
Asaina of Ekobayashi,
Benkei, Kintoki
and such fellows
came to hell
and destroyed the infinite
cauldron, the scale of karma,
the mirror of Jōhari and other implements of hell
by trampling them, making do with temporary tools.
Now they wish to have new implements made,
so everyone is consulting together.

[Dialogue sections]
"First, let us go
and see for ourselves."

"We are
the Jizō
of the
six realms,
so we probably cannot
raise money as we wish."

[Dialogue at the feet of the demon on the lower right]
"This upcoming
construction is
important."

[Below Enma]
"Enma,
Jizō
Bodhisattva,
various kings
say:
To your
branch temples
we command
and humbly request
donations."

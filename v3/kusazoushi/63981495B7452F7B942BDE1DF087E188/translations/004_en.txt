The old woman of Sanzu River: "What is so sad? This is most certainly something that has never happened since hell began."

[Jizō's dialogue]
"This is worrying regarding that matter. Even with deliberation, we cannot easily construct these things."

[The demon on the right, looking at the broken cauldron]
"Asaina, Kintoki, and Benkei came and smashed everything to pieces, causing great trouble for hell."

[Enma's dialogue]
"Jizō-sama, this is troublesome. The bottom of the infinite cauldron has fallen out, and hell is in great difficulty at this time."

[The old woman of Sanzu River]
"The old woman has no place to stay and is troubled, waa waa."

[The demon on the left's dialogue]
"The mirror of Jōhari is also broken and hidden, and the scale of karma is gone. It suddenly broke."

[Someone's dialogue below the scale]
"If Jizō-sama is in trouble, who knows what will happen."

[The dialogue of the ox-head and horse-head demons in the tree]
"The crotch of the tree makes our necks unstable. We humbly request that our stand also be urgently reconstructed."

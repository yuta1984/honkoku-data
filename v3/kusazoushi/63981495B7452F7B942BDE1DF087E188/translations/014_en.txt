At Oiso Kiridoshi, a stone Jizo hall was built, and travelers on the road come to worship.

Even now, there are said to be diagonal scars (like a priest's robe sash).

The Life-Extending Jizo Bodhisattva graciously saves the land as an example for the latter ages - how grateful we should be.

"Is this Shigitatsuzawa?"

【Packhorse driver's dialogue】
"Let me tend to the horse. Please ride to Odawara."

Tenmei 4th Year, Year of the Dragon (1784)

Here, as everyone knows, there was a creature called Noppera Nyūdō (Faceless Monk), the grandson of Mikoshi Nyūdō. Reflecting deeply, he thought: "In any case, these days, no matter how interestingly we transform ourselves, humans don't understand, and our methods of transformation are inherited from our parents. We end up transforming exactly as planned. Since there's nothing we can do about it, from now on we monsters should also enter the Buddhist path and hold a temple exhibition. If we use our family temple, Ekōin in Honjo, it would be quick."

"Indeed, let's hold a temple exhibition. First, what do you think would be good? How about a child-eating Enma (King of Hell)?"

"What I came up with is that a monster Jizō would be good. What do you think?"

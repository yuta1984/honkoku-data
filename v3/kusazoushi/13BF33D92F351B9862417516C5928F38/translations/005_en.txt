After this, Mikooshi-no-suke, following the mountain god's divine revelation, convinced his wife as well. He quickly took his child and ventured deep into the mountains. Though pitiful, he abandoned the child and on his way back, as snow began falling heavily, he saw a beautiful woman approaching from the distance, as lovely as a snow-covered privy shelter. Mikooshi-no-suke thought to himself: "There's no way the fox and tanuki spirits among my monster companions wouldn't recognize me. Whatever kind of woman this may be, if she's trying to deceive me, she's a detestable creature." As he drew closer to look, he realized this was the snow woman, a sheltered daughter whom the young ones among his monster companions had been talking about.

When Mikooshi realized this was Oyuki, his long neck muscles and spine shivered with such infatuation that he tried every possible way to win her over.

When called to, she responded as if it were "a boat when needing to cross," and they took each other's hands. Speaking of bonds for this lifetime and connections from past lives, her manner was certainly like the dialogue from the second act opening of "Dofu" (a kabuki play).

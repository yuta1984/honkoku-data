Mitsudō suffered a near-death experience at the hands of Kakubei and barely escaped with his life. As night was about to deepen, he leaned against a stone Jizō statue by the roadside and dozed off. In what seemed neither dream nor illusion, he encountered his deceased mother, the rokurokubi (long-necked monster).

"Now, now, Mitsudō, I am your mother, the rokurokubi known as Omae. How dear you are to me! You are so admirable in your determination to follow in your father's footsteps and become a monster - it moves my heart, so I have appeared before you. However, you cannot expect to transform while in human form. If you wish to inherit the family tradition in Mino Province, there is a shrine called Dainyugdō Daigongen about two or three ri to the east of here. If you pray to this deity, you will eventually be counted among the monsters. You must go there immediately and make your prayers."

Having said this, her form vanished like clearing clouds and mist.

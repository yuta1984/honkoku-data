Here again, among the monsters, there was a wicked one with an evil heart - a creature called "Mōmonkwa" (a type of demon), whom even Master Kosaru knew. This creature found a human child of about three years old, raised it for six or seven years, and consulted with mountain swindlers.

"Ah, what a bargain! Previously there were buckets, clanging sounds, face or oil-licking, various entertainments."

The mountain swindler cat-demon said "various things" and bought the child for thirty-five ryō.

"A fair-skinned one is rare - I'll step in and buy it. Sell it to me for thirty ryō."

From then on, the human child passed into the hands of the cat-demon, and after consulting with the mountain swindler's companions - herons, foxes, raccoon dogs and the like - they taught the child a few tricks. A large monkey came down, set up a banner reading "Human Child," and late into the night, they made it into a sideshow attraction in the wide alley of a restaurant district. It was a great success.

Mikoshi Nyudo happened to pass by this place, and thinking "Could this be my child?" he poked only his head through the reed screen to look.

"What a terrible thing!"

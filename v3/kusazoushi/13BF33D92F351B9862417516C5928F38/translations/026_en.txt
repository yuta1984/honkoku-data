Mitsudō followed his mother's teaching and fasted for seven days while praying earnestly to Dainyugdō: "Please make me depart from human form, even if just a little, and give me the appearance of a monster." When the seven days were complete, the Daigongen appeared and spoke:

"Excellent, excellent! I am Dainyugdō. Though you were born human, your wish to inherit the way of monsters is normally impossible to fulfill. However, considering your various hardships in your failed attempts at transformation and your sincere devotion in praying to me, I shall give you one of my eyes. Practice diligently and you shall become a leader among monsters. Split the characters of your name 'Mitsudō' (三つ道) and insert 'me' (目) to write 'me iru' (目入る). From now on you shall become Mitsume-nyūdō (Three-Eyed Priest). Never doubt this."

Thereafter, the monsters revered this deity as Hitotsu-me Daigongen (One-Eyed Great Avatar).

Wish fulfilled
How grateful indeed!

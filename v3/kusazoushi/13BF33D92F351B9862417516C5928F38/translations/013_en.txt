Now, Mikoshi Nyudo kept thinking about various matters from Ryogoku, but as the freak show prospered day by day and the monsters were trained until dawn, he felt great pity and paid money to buy back his child from the cat-demon. He then gradually told stories of karma and cause-and-effect, explaining to the child the reason for spiritual awakening.

"You too should shave your head to extinguish the karma of being born human. What one is born as cannot be changed even with regret, so at least through religious practice, may you be reborn as a monster in the next life."

With this teaching, he entrusted the child to a human priest at a nearby mountain temple called Dorakuji, making him a disciple. The child then left home to wander through various provinces.

"There is no one with such terrible karma as myself."

Soon after, on the seventh night after Oroku's birth, the celebration went on until late into the night, so both the nursing and the birth-spirit (ubume) took a rest.

Mikooshi-no-suke alone kept vigil through the night, brewing medicines and such, but exhausted from recent events, he dozed off drowsily. While sleeping, a strange figure with disheveled hair appeared in his dream.

The birth-spirit, also exhausted from recent events, fell asleep unconsciously.

"Excellent, excellent! I am the tutelary deity of all monsters, the mountain god. Under my protection, peace has been maintained. The mother, through her painful ascetic practices and confinement, has not taken a single bite of food, thus her form resembles that of a human. Because of this, a human soul entered by mistake and cannot return despite regret - accept this as karma. Since this is greatly misshapen for a monster's child, you should abandon it quickly in the mountains or elsewhere. Do not doubt this at all."

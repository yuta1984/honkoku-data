Mikoshi Nyudo had been practicing various austerities and came to this mountain, but it happened to be during a heavy snowfall, causing him great difficulty.

"Ah, what heavy snow has fallen. When I was young, I was enchanted by O-Yuki's beauty and charm, and made snow the go-between for our chance encounters and conversations. But that too was snow, this too is snow - what a changed and transient world this is."

"Excuse me, women, in this heavy snow it's difficult to go to my home or anywhere else. Please, even if it's just at the edge of your place, I beg you for lodging for one night."

"[Text unclear due to fading]... however, this is not an inn, so we cannot offer you lodging. Please try elsewhere."

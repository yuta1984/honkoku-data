The three-eyed one walks about with his three eyes rolling in sleep, and because he is not like ordinary people, all humans are frightened of him, which brings joy to his heart. Here he mistakes the horse-headed one and speaks, quietly telling his life story.

"No matter that I have three eyes, I mistook you due to my recent monster ways. Please forgive me. I am now temporarily staying at Dodomeki's place. No matter what, I must find my father, and until my father verbally permits me to be head of the monsters, nothing can be done."

The horse-headed one, thinking it over carefully, realizes this three-eyed one is unknown among his companions, so he asks if perhaps this might be the child of Mikoshi Nyudo, and hearing the details, he is shocked.

"Our companions have decided to seek you out and establish you as the successor to Mikoshi's house, with everyone agreeing to make you the leader. In that case, it will be inconvenient until we find Lord Mikoshi Nyudo, but please stay hidden at Dodomeki's place."

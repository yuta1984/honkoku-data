No matter how much he tried to frighten people, they wouldn't be fooled, so Mitsudō suddenly had an idea and decided to put on a large papier-mâché head of a blind monk (zatō) to try scaring them. He left the village and went deep into the mountains, waiting for passersby. When someone who appeared to be a hunter came along, he suddenly stuck out his face from behind, but unexpectedly the man was quite formidable and grabbed him, pinned him down, snatched away his papier-mâché head, and gave him a terrible beating.

【Hunter's dialogue】
"You detestable wretch! Who do you think I am? I'm the famous tanuki Kakubei who even appeared in Kanpei's seppuku scene. I won't be intimidated by such tricks. You fake monsters!"

【Mitsudō's dialogue】
"I'm terribly sorry! I misjudged you. I will certainly be more careful from now on."

【Hunter's dialogue】
"Even if I killed you, you'd be worthless."

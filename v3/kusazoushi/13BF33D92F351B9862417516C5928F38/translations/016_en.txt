Now, the head of all monsters, Mikoshi Nyudo, had previously given up on the world and departed on a pilgrimage through various provinces. Since then, there has been no monster to keep the others in line, and the conduct of monsters has become extremely poor. The monsters gathered together for a consultation.

Among them, Kawanara (possibly a monster's name) said: "There was offspring of Mikoshi Nyudo, whose mother was a rokurokubi (long-necked monster), and she indeed gave birth to a human child. Now he has become human and serves as the head priest Mitsudo in Toraku (eastern Kyoto). Let us elevate him to inherit Mikoshi's house and establish it as a temple."

[Sea Monster's comment]
"Indeed, we cannot manage without a leader. In recent years, it seems that monsters have taken to the practice of frightening people and stealing from them."

"Things have become terribly corrupt."

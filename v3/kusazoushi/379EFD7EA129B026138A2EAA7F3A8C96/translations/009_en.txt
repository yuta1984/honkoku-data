The palanquin goblin had been hired for the ghost story session and was making unexpected money, saying "Now my luck is turning!" when someone from the hidden village of sparrows came asking him to put a monster inside a basket to give to a mean old woman. This too would become quite profitable.

【Monster in the basket】
♪ "Momongii! I'll catch and eat you! Aah, uuh!"

【Mean old woman's dialogue】
"You damn sparrows! You've put me in a terrible situation! Please spare my life, I beg you!"

【Mikoshi-nyudo's dialogue】
♪ "Wait, old woman! Don't you want to be good tea-drinking friends and have a chat?"

"Ah, there's nothing spiteful about it. I was just hired to frighten people."

【Monster's dialogue】
♪ "Boss, this should be enough now. We've already gotten paid and frightened the old woman."

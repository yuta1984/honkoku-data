The palanquin goblin moved beyond Hakone, but first, before getting stuck without lodging, he walked around looking at various shops here and there. In the mountains of Izu, there was a dilapidated hut that was falling apart, and fortunately it had a sign saying "shop for rent." He inquired with the landlord, who was described as "a bear monster living in a cave ahead," and when he made his request, the landlord said: "This shop was quickly rented until about ten years ago, but now the house has become old, is falling apart with walls crumbling and floors rotting to the point where grass grows. So it's perfect lodging for monsters, and therefore it's a bit expensive. Even within Izu and Sagami provinces, this area is quite a location, so the shops are particularly filthy."

♪ "Whenever renovation is imminent, there are too many people wanting to rent, and it won't do"

"Entry and exit from the alley is only at the hour of the ox (2-3 AM), so mind the cleaning"

♪ "This is a fine tenement, all overgrown with grass"

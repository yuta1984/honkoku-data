It's been a while since a monster story collection was created, so you might think it would be quite an interesting entertainment, but since it's about monsters, which are generally dismissed as unsophisticated, it's clear that today's young people won't like it. If the author had any sense, he would have washed his hands of it and retired by now.

As for myself, being an amateur enthusiast, I slowly began this monster entertainment. The first scene I present to you shows them moving beyond Hakone. Defeated by Kinpira and Kintoki, they begin to panic around their boss's palanquin, leaving their familiar dwelling place and moving far away beyond Hakone with no particular destination.

"What a pushy thing to say when we don't have anything to be stolen anyway!"

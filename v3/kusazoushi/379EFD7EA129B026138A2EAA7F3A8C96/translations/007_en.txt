When monsters appear, it is customary for them to blow foul-smelling wind. However, monsters who don't yet understand this don't know how to blow such stinking wind, and especially the fake country monsters have no way of knowing such things. So the palanquin goblin devised a plan to make money too: he had bellows made, put rotting fish bones inside them, and when wind was blown from these bellows, they would produce a fishy stench. Thus the palanquin goblin said:

"Good, good, it's done! This is an absolutely essential item when monsters appear. Each monster should want to buy one bellows apiece." He stocked up tremendously and said "Now let's start selling!" 

Some panicked and bought them, but most said "No, no, while it's good to blow stinking wind when appearing, we might forget and accidentally use the bellows even on important days of religious purification, so this is something we don't need," and they bought but then returned them. Country monsters are honest no matter what.

♪ "Sui-sui-no-sui, how about it?"

♪ "How stinky! Indeed, even I feel sick from how fishy it smells"

"Sui-sui-sui, susura sui-no-sui"

"What a stinking smell"

♪ "When you appear blowing this wind, it looks exceptionally impressive. With just 'hyoudoro' sounds alone, it's like Ashinaga Island - like a blind masseur tumbling over, it doesn't look good at all"

The two men have transformed. Kōnoshin's actual age is eighty-five, and Yohei is twenty-eight. However, his hair is white, and matching his appearance, he has arranged his hair and made a flashy undergarment with sarasa fabric featuring flint-strike patterns. Nevertheless, he lacks a merchant's spirit, and from his current age, he has been learning from this Yohei and doing the same business. Kōnoshin's appearance is that of someone twenty-four or twenty-five years old, but he has a somewhat gloomy disposition regarding things, fingering prayer beads in his sleeve, appearing somewhat elderly.

Here there was also a man named Taihei who was a devotee of Daikokuten (the god of wealth). One night, Daikokuten appeared and said, "Because you faithfully worship on these kinoe-ne days, I shall give you this mallet. From now on, begin operating as a money changer," and then entered into the sacred cabinet.

"How grateful I am. I humbly accept."

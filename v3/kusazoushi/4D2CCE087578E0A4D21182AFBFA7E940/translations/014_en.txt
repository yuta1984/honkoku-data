Thinking to indulge himself with one ryō for the pleasure of his retirement years, he bought a thousand-ryō lottery ticket for one ryō. Fortunately it won, so he obtained a thousand ryō. He donated one hundred ryō as an offering, and with the remaining nine hundred ryō ordered a solid gold Amida Buddha statue, bought a crystal prayer bead rosary of fine quality, and planned to donate a temple bell to his family temple with the remaining money.

But thinking this was all rather old-fashioned, he decided he should instead pray to Daikokuten and such deities, so he came to Yoshiwara. At Matsubaya he intended to select a courtesan and buy her services, but first thinking to take the money home to make his old wife happy too, he boarded a choki boat to return home. On the way, caught in a storm off Teppōzu, with the weight of the thousand ryō the boat was too small and the waves too rough, threatening to sink, so saying "nothing is worth more than life," he threw the box of thousand ryō into the sea.

Even so, cleansing one's spirit at Yoshiwara, just this indulgence alone costs two ryō - money is indeed a powerful thing.

Preface

Here there was a garment made of monster hide, whose design was extremely old-fashioned, stained with grime, torn and frayed, so that it could not be mended even with patchwork brocade. Thus it was given to a secondhand clothes dealer and exchanged for the price of a single evening meal. The used clothing merchant washed it and transformed the monster's hide into entertaining tales of supernatural beings, adapting it with old techniques. However, this resulted in dyeing the sophistication of theatrical chaos and the refinement of the pleasure quarters in an unsuitably pale yellow color. Therefore, I have rewritten even demons and spirits as decorative illustrations, and humbly beg your forgiveness for attempting to deceive the readers in this way.

A young Buddhist monk (oshoke) received one bu from a parishioner for memorial service fees, but embezzled it and conducted no service. Though people might scoff that there's no such trickery, the place indeed smells of incense from the Buddhist altar.

From this Japanese person's impiety, anger arose, and with 200 mon he bought grilled eel and five gō of sake, and bought wish-fulfilling backing sandals for 400 mon. This exhausted two shu, but since it was the pleasure of one bu, he thought there might also be male prostitution and such, so he walked around Yoshichō in the pleasure quarters once or twice. However, being tricked by one bu's worth of money made him angry, and when he wet his eyebrows, the fox departed, and he was left clutching the original two shu.

Indeed, since he is stealing this, he profits a total of one bu.

[It was believed that foxes count human eyebrows to bewitch people, and when one doesn't want to be tricked by a fox, they wet their eyebrows with saliva so the hairs stick together and cannot be counted.]

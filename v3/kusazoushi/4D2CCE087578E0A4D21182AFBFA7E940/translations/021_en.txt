Since [the fox spirit] appeared in dreams as a pillow god to borrowers in various places, everyone scrambled to bring back their money with principal and interest included to repay their debts. People of all social classes gathered in great numbers, creating a marketplace in front of Fukutokuya's gate. This was truly Fukutokuya's "third year" [moment of great fortune].

Since all those who had borrowed money returned it without exception, the fortunate people gained family profits and prospered brilliantly. The merchants achieved commercial prosperity, and their brief period of hardship became a comedic play written by the fox, leading to auspicious prosperity.

[Dialogue]
"The money that wouldn't budge no matter how much we beat or struck it yesterday night says it will return - this is strange and most grateful (I bow in reverence)!"

"The principal of fifty ryō comes to twenty-eight ryō, three monme, five bu, six rin - I return it with every bit accounted for."

"That's quite painful."

A person with the appearance of an Orisuke (a low-ranking servant to a samurai family) came with twenty-four mon. The parlor scene immediately became like a bustling townscape.

First, he entered the bathhouse for eight mon, polished his geta thoroughly, strolled around Ryōgoku, released an eel for one mon as an offering for his ancestors, came to Asakusa, bought candy with three mon from fishing, and while eating it went around the dōjō (training halls), then went out for soken (window shopping/browsing without buying) through the back gate.

With twelve mon, he made grilled corn on the cob a lifelong pleasure, and while wandering around Yoshiwara, the day grew dark. Though his stomach rumbled, having no choice, he wanted to eat vegetarian soba, but having not even the amount of earwax (no money), it was a gain of twenty-four mon.

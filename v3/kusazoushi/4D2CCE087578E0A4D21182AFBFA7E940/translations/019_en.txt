A merchant couple living quite well, coming to gamble with twenty ryō in hand - what fools they are. Even the proprietor of a small establishment in Shinagawa frequenting Ōiso - truly this is the way of couples in flourishing Edo.

The couple arranged two palanquins and planned to visit Enoshima, Kamakura, Uraga, and Hakone for hot spring cures, then continue on a pilgrimage around Yamato province. Traveling six to seven ri per day, they would visit not only famous scenic spots and historical sites but also shrines and temples without exception - truly the finest form of pleasure. They stayed two days at an inn in Nara and planned to rest at a teahouse in Miwa during the day before heading to Kyoto.

However, they kept getting lost on the roads and returned to Nara. When they tried to go to Osaka, they ended up in Miwa again. Here, having been bewitched by foxes, they wandered about in all directions. While wandering around, they spent all forty ryō. Though they had originally profited twenty ryō, they were now completely short of travel money. With only two bu remaining, they boarded a boat, but a great storm arose, and while crying "rescue boat, rescue boat," they arrived back in Shinagawa.

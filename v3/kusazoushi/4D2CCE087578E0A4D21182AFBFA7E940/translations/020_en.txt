A famous moneylender called Fukutokuya heard this story and said, "The daily profit from one cup at a time would be far more profitable than lending money. Moreover, if there's no worry about 'sleeping or declining' [defaulting on loans]," he called his clerks and chief clerks to consult about taking a thousand ryō there every day.

[Dialogue]
"At the rate of one thousand ryō per day, I'll lend up to thirty thousand ryō in a month, without demanding repayment."

Even the fox side was extremely troubled by this, and the establishment was on the verge of collapse. The lender, having gained people's sympathy, stood as a pillow god before those who had borrowed money.

"Somehow repay Fukutokuya's money with principal and interest all together by tomorrow. If you say that afterwards neither asking nor begging will work, then I'll swallow that myself and let you live half a life. That's fine, say that. If you don't repay, you shall be kept in poverty forever."

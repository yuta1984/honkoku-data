A stingy fellow with two bu became arrogant and decided to show off, taking along two one-bu geishas. These too were paid companions, and from around four o'clock they strolled around Mimeguri Shrine, Akiba Shrine and such places. Though he usually went to Nakadaya, today he had them follow him and decided on Musashiya instead. Being greatly conceited, he thought to show the foxes the ceiling, and making this his final moment, he drank heavily. From the boat and everything else, it was quite an extravagant affair, and he said "What a fine mood this is!"

Spending two bu for about two ryō worth of extravagance seemed like a good deal with the three-boat crawl, but unexpectedly, this one too was one of those creatures well-versed in the ways of shapeshifters. Suddenly the day passed, the geisha's fee became a day-and-night charge, he lost two bu and gained only half the benefit.

"Who requested that pleasure boat with you? You there, you there, are your ears attached to the floor?"

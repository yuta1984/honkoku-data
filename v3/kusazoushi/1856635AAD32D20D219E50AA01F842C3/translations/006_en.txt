In this manner, when one considers the passion involved,
it becomes quite interesting to hear about
the pawned items.
The obi (sash) and such
precious
things,
what a
loss.
That household's
son—
since there's no alternative, he completely
squanders money,
shameless with his twenty thousand ryō
debt. This time
he absolutely must
redeem it—a binding agreement.
What a shame,
but he pawns it
and first borrows
one thousand ryō privately.

Even the master
would be
disliked
if he's from the countryside.

Oh my,
it's heart-
crushing.

The tool shop debt
is three bu,
but there's
a little
something—some accessories
I want
to buy,
so lend me
two [ryō].
If that's
insufficient,
I'll put in
ten monme
as rent
for the hairpin.

In Kamakura,
at a certain mansion
in Ōgigayatsu,
among those who frequent there,
there's considerable
debt.
Well, this can be managed somehow,
but the fellow who comes
with a walking stick is bothersome.
If there were about twenty ryō
that would be good, but in any case
I'd like to pay it all off
completely.
Borrowing money
has a terrible
stigma attached.
For the above reasons,
I'd like to
consult with you.

That's quite
reasonable—
absolutely so.

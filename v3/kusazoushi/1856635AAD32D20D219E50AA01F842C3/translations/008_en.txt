Since Kinzō had
completely lost
his fortune,
his chronic illness
was completely
cured,
and he felt
as if awakening

home,
departed
together with
her husband.

something, even a little, but
the fact that she says
nothing at all—
I wonder if she might be
like an elder sister,
but she doesn't interfere
in her husband's affairs.

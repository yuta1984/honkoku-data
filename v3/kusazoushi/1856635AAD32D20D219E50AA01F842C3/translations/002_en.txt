Formal Statement

This spring, we thought to do
something extraordinarily interesting,
and though we considered various ideas,
since no good thoughts came to mind, we were troubled.
It may be as trivial as placing a tea bowl
by the well's edge
and praying,
but please do not say it has deep meaning,
and we humbly request that you not take offense
at this troublesome matter.
Respectfully, with fear and reverence, we state the above.

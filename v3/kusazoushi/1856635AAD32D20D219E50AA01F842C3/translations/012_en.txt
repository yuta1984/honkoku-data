Bishamonten, having heard that
Kinzō had encountered
thieves, and being well-matched
with Fudō-son
(being of like mind),
easily and
familiarly
transmitted the art of
the paralyzing spell.
The two who had
received this transmission
thought "now is the time" and
used the paralyzing
spell to render
the three men
immobile,
making them into
one huddled mass.
Like mice that
gnaw at the Iwami silver mines,
though they gnaw away,
they are
pitiful creatures.

Being so stubborn in this way,
perhaps their
remorse should be
forgiven.

All of them are
flustered
as if waking up needing
to urinate and being confused.

When the wet nurse heard
that all three men
had become paralyzed,
she retrieved
all the stolen
goods
and bundled them
in a
furoshiki cloth.

Since Kinzō had
gone to Edo, she came
searching and met up with them
in the vicinity of Ryōgoku.
Both rejoiced greatly
and returned home
triumphantly.

"Everything has been
recovered.
What's more, even the large
tobacco pouch
is here."

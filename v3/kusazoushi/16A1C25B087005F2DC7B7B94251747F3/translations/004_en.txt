Here there was a samurai named Yokogawa Kyōsuke who was infatuated with Oman, the daughter of Kamezaki Gonnoshin. He repeatedly tried to seduce her through letters, but she would not even reply. When she married into the Kozu Tomosaburō family, he was filled with such resentment that one night he snuck into her home, slit her throat while she slept, and secretly fled.

Having killed the object of his hateful love, he appeared quite relieved.

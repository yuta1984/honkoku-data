The next customer is a most pitiful son who appears to have something guilty about him, whether it's his father or himself. Dressed not in contemporary fashion but in the usual old-fashioned style, secretly from his mother, thinking that young men must maintain social appearances, he wears a large hawk-brown crested haori like an outer garment, a dark brown kosode with a bright red brocade obi, and black leather backing. As he passes below the mansion's window, a maid's voice calls out "The medicine Buddha is passing by!" but another maid says "That's not the medicine Buddha, it's what they call a man-about-town or something like that." Coming with his elaborate outfit, thinking "I shall head toward Fukagawa," ♪ the elder brother looks refined.

The next customer also appears to be an honest person, walking aimlessly with a worried expression, when he comes upon a place with no foot traffic where three boxes of a thousand ryo each are sitting. Looking around, there's no one about. "Oh no, this seems like something that could come back to bite me later." However, among the Twenty-Four Paragons of Filial Piety, there was one who dug up a golden pot, and he thinks it would be foolish to leave behind what heaven has granted. Summoning all his strength for this once-in-a-lifetime chance, he shoulders one thousand-ryo box and grabs another, but finds he cannot walk with two boxes. Unable to leave them behind yet unable to carry them, he entered a treasure mountain but, having shouldered what he could, must return empty-handed - how regrettable! Like Tokimune's rash behavior at the confrontation scene, wondering what to do, ♪ how refined you look.

Seibei became
a disowned man
and being
penniless, could not
conduct business.
In any case,
he liked
to think about
various
matters,
and though he knew nothing about
the proper handling
of counting sticks
or
divination stalks,
he hit upon the idea
of
fortune-telling.

When asked "Will lost things
appear?" he says
"They will appear."
When asked "Will they not appear?" he says
"They will not appear."
And making everything about the future
into divination,
though he tells fortunes, like his "foresight"
both hitting the mark and missing are mysterious,
though hitting and missing are both strange,
there is nothing
particularly
mysterious
about missing the mark.

What time
is it
now?

"Yesterday at dusk
something was taken from me.
Please divine this
for me."

"It must be a hair ornament,
and moreover it appears
to be silver."

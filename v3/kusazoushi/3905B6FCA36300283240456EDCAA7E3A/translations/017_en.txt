To his cousin
he would borrow money
and for the country's peace
of mind,
intending to rely on
trustworthy people,
he composed
a letter.
As he slept,
his own
initial mountain
cleared up,
with a lofty atmosphere
where hawks danced
and played,
just like
in front of the eel shop
as usual.
The fellow who would
put eggplant
in sukiyaki
for one pair of footwear
costing eighteen mon,
about five pairs
he was seeing
in his dream
when there came
a sound from the front
that woke him up.
Upon awakening,
he learned that
through his uncle's
intervention in his home country,
he had been permitted to return to Kanto.
"What a truly good dream
that was," he rejoiced.

"Are you still sleeping?"
"Keshi..." (several characters unreadable)

"Is Master Seibei
here?"

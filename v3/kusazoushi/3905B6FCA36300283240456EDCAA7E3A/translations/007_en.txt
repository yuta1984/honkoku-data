Finally urged by the wholesale merchant's clerk
for breakfast in Fukagawa
in the morning, he visits Hachiman shrine, goes from Susaki
Benten to Rakan-ji temple,
and at Kameido Tenjin's plum garden
where plums are bearing fruit,
he says nothing but such things as
"How many barrels would it make
if these were turned into pickled plums?"
Coming to Akiba and Mimeguri,
having heard the story that
this is where Kikaku
composed his rain-prayer
poem,
he takes out his writing case and listens to a cuckoo
on the embankment at Mimeguri:
"At Mimeguri
on top of the embankment
a cuckoo" -
whether dancing
or composing haiku
it's all the same thing,
just saying useless things.
He crosses to
the opposite shore,
eats honest
soba noodles
and returns.

At Matsuchiyama
will the parting one
return?
Coming, coming, coming

A person
getting off?

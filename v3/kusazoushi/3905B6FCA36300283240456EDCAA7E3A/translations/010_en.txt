Ittoku bought
a courtesan named Kisen, while Seibei
ordered one serving,
had two cups served, and they drank
excessively together. Though his companion thought it foolish,
the guest was
in extremely good spirits
while playing, saying "The mood
is changing!"

At this point,
they kept
exchanging
and replacing
the teapots of Shinchu,
and whenever
a cup remained,
the brothel madam
made the
young men
drink it,
giving them
one bu
each.
The saying "there is great fortune
in tea"
began to be said
from this time.

"It looks
a bit
strongly brewed,

but it's just
right.

We prefer
tea
over sake,
sir.
Oh my, oh my, oh my!"

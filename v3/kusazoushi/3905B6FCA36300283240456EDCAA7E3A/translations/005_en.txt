From his father's time,
he stays at
his regular inn
called Sanoya.
In the garden there are
plum, cherry, and pine
potted
plants,
so this innkeeper is also
a refined person.
"If an important person were to stay,
we would light fires to warm them, in Kaga
Umeda, in Etchu"

Thinking he would
tease
him,
and feeling it would be a pity,
intending to tease him a little,
he said "Innkeeper, these are fine potted
plants," and when told "Please compose
a poem," he was troubled
to no end. However, disliking
to say he didn't know,
muttering "plums fly" under
his breath,
when asked "I would like
to hear an auspicious poem,"
he tilted his head
slightly and composed:
"Though plums do not bloom
and cherry blossoms do not wither,
in this world, why should
the pine be joyful?"
The innkeeper, with
an expressionless face, said
"This is...
[unclear text]
Wife, rejoice!
This is an auspicious poem."

"I am truly
impressed.
Someone like
myself
cannot even compose
popular
songs."

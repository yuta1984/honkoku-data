Seibei
visits the
wholesale merchants in
Edo,
conducting business
and making rounds
to his regular customers,
saying "It's quite a strict matter -
I don't drink even a drop
of sake,
and have no time
to watch plays
for even a day.
At least after finishing
my business,
as a story to tell back
home,
I would like
to visit
Rakan-sama."
At the shop
when a young person
[two or three lines are faded]
speaks,
he says "Would there be
anyone like you
who only wants
money
and comes to
Edo
and returns
without
any sightseeing?"
But he
values even
a little time,
and this time
somehow
[unclear text]
says it's not so.

"Let's go to the mountain and have
a drink"

"Tayu is
a great
person"

"Let's have
some ochazuke (tea over rice)"

"Genzaemon
[unclear]
please"

Seibie is
different from his
father's
time -
with his three-cornered hat
rustling,
shaped like
kamaboko (fish cake),
leather
drawstring
chin strap made of
golden
metal
fittings.
However,
by nature
he has no interest
in women,
and though he tries
everything,
he has never
properly studied anything.
As for his talents -
good dancing, shogi,
oriha games, or
even four-mon gambling -
he has never done
any of these.
Only in this regard does his
father
not worry, but
when sent to collect money
in the bustling
places of Edo,
the less he speaks,
the less he can be
instructed. There,
a shrewd
person who has been
to Edo
two or three times already says:
"There are no practitioners here."
"Well then, those who
engage in debauchery -
what kind of people are they?
Their usefulness is unclear,"
he says arrogantly as he departs.

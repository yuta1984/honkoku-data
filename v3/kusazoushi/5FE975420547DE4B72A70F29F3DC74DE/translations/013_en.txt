Yonosuke, with his former servant named Jiheē—
though somewhat foolish, he was a dependable man in any case—brought Kinugawa along
and asked him a favor.
【Yonosuke's dialogue】
"The outskirts of Hanyū village
are also unsettling,
so let me stay
at your place
for a while. Since I have
quite a bit of money
with me,
we can take our time
and have
a good time."

【Bottom right, Jiheē's dialogue】
"Please don't
worry about it. Stay
at my place
as long
as you
like."

Okane had become disabled—not from birth, but due to Yonosuke's actions—
and wandered here and there seeking to take revenge on Yonosuke.
When she heard that he and Kinugawa had secretly entered Jiheē's residence,
she came looking for them. She deceived a foolish shop apprentice,
carrying a bag of eboshi candy,
and entered the house.
【Shop apprentice's dialogue】
"Thieves are strictly forbidden from entering this house. As long as you're not a thief,
please come in. In return, give us some delicious treats too."
【Bottom left, Okane's dialogue】
"As it happens,
I have some
eboshi candy
here. Please eat
this and
let us
enter the
house."

Yonosuke dreamed of Kinugawa
and dozed off while agonizing over his thoughts.
From this dream he broke into quite a sweat,
and when awakened by a teahouse man
and asked about the situation,
he learned that Kinugawa had finally
been received by Sugi Daijin (the great deity),
and had already left the pleasure quarters yesterday
and passed away.
Since lamenting serves no purpose anyway,
you should cleanly
give up.
Here are some chestnut-burr rice cakes
I bought
for you. Please have some
tea with these
and treat it as a joke
to put an end
to this matter.

【Bottom right, Yonosuke's dialogue】
"'Dreams are reverse dreams' —
how well that saying fits.
It seems only
the chestnut
burr
rice cakes
benefit
from this
situation."

Yonosuke achieved enlightenment through his dream, and resolved
to decide on his future path in life.
At that point, Jihei the loach seller arranged a wedding ceremony at his establishment.
A large Otafuku-faced daughter from the Edo vicinity,
wishing to be wed to a good man,
comes to Yonosuke's place with
a substantial dowry of twenty ryō.
When he removes
the round cotton padding
and looks at
her face,
it is exactly like
the Otafuku
he saw in his dream,
which terrifies him
greatly,
but they
harmoniously
complete their
marriage.

【Bottom right, Yonosuke's dialogue】
"My
household
is extremely poor.
Please keep that
in mind for
all matters."

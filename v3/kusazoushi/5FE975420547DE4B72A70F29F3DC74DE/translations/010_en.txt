"This is really
too frightening

【Eighth Page Front】
This master was
very wealthy, and
in the depths of his garden he had built
a rock mountain
piled up with stones.
He kept his money stored
in a gate within those rocks
and strictly guarded against
thieves. But Okane stole
the key to that rock cave,
hung a rope from
a tree branch, and
calling herself "Naru-gami" (Thunder God),
she climbed up with great difficulty
and stole
the money.

【Yonosuke's dialogue】
"Danger-
ous, dangerous!
Quietly, quietly!"

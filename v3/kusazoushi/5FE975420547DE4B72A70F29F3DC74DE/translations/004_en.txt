Fukubei's relative,
a beggar-priest in Asakusa
called Blind Tōji,
being a shrewd person, upon seeing Okiku
immediately calculates the profit
and confidently agrees to take her in.

【Blind Tōji's dialogue】
Well, well, you've gone to such
trouble with all these
gifts—they're all
fine things indeed.

【Middle right of scene - Wife from behind, dialogue】
My, my, such thoughtfulness.
We'll use all of this
for that girl's
preparations.

【Bottom left of scene - Daughter's dialogue】
First,
I'll keep her
close by me
to train her properly,
and when spring comes
I'll place her
in a good position.

【Fukubei's dialogue】
This money amounts to
twenty ryō.
Ten ryō
I give to you,
and the remaining ten ryō
please use for
Okiku's preparations.
Please take good care of her
and train her
well.

【Bottom right of scene - Okiku's dialogue】
Grandmother,
from now on
please take care
of me. I don't
know
anything.

Okane, having had the rope cut, fell
into the board fence,
struck her face
on the stones below,
and sprained her foot,
so her eyes were tightly crushed,
her mouth split, her nose
scratched, her cheeks swollen up,
she became lame,
and took on an unsightly appearance.
In great anger,
she climbed over the board fence and chased after him.

【Okane's dialogue】
"That inhuman
Yonosuke—how far
shall I let him
escape?"

Yonosuke brought the two thousand ryō
to the Matsuura-ya.
Since Sugi-daijin's
money from his home province
had not yet
arrived,
he was greatly pleased, gave him fifteen hundred ryō,
paid off another two hundred ryō
in debts,
and planned to save the remaining
three hundred ryō
for himself to
repay favors and
live comfortably.
【Kinugawa's dialogue】
"There could be
no happier
thing than this!"

it must be
an overly fine

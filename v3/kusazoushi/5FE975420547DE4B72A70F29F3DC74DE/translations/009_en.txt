Yonosuke suddenly had
an idea and went
to Hanyu Village in Shimōsa Province
to arrange for money.
There he found a large
house. When he went around
to the storehouse
side and looked,
he saw there was
a pavilion
with tatami seating.
While he was resting,
captivated by the irises
in full bloom
around the pond nearby,
the daughter of the house's master, named Okane,
an ordinary girl in a long-sleeved kimono, spotted Yonosuke
from the pavilion.

【Yonosuke's dialogue, bottom right of image】
"Looking in the water's reflection,
the irises
are blooming,
and though she has
some pockmarks,
she's quite
[unclear text]
truly
magnificent, magnificent.
But in Hanyu Village,
being called a deity
is a bit too
strong."

The master's daughter Okane whispered
to her page and invited Yonosuke into the pavilion,
boldly trying to seduce him:

"To take you away
with me, whether to
some mountain retreat or
to the Kyoto-Osaka region,
whatever we do,
without plenty of money
it cannot be done.
Please arrange about
two pack-horse loads worth.
Let's elope together."

"Please take me away.
If it's now,
please take
me along
too."

【Page's dialogue】
"Please fulfill
the young lady's
request."

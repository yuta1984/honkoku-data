Long ago, in a rural area of Kamakura, there was a farmer named Fukubei.
He had one daughter who was
a beauty superior to a hundred others, and this year she turned seventeen,
so he thought to send her to Edo to work as a servant,
and took her to a relative's place.

【Bottom right - Daughter's dialogue】
Father, you too
must be tired.
Look over there—
those people walking around
wearing such fine
clothes.

【Bottom left - Father's dialogue】
Okiku, since you're
not used to walking,
your feet must
surely hurt.
We'll arrive
soon.

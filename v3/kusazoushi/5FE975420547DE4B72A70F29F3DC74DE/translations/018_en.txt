【Upper text, Sugi Daijin's dialogue】
"Work
diligently
and put your
heart into it."

The two meet
for the first time.
Kinugawa has been
received by
Sugi Daijin
and lacks
nothing,
being revered
as his lady wife.
Now when she
sees
Yonosuke,
she shows
not the slightest
recognition
and does not mention
Yonosuke's background.
Courtesans
are all like this,
so young gentlemen, you shouldn't
get too deeply involved... [text continues but is hidden by binding]

【Right middle section】
Through his wife's connections, Yonosuke found
a position as a servant
and went to work in Kamakura.
His master turned out to be none other than Sugi Daijin,
and the lady of the house was Kinugawa. Truly
understanding the uncontrollable nature of this floating world,
he served faithfully according to proper law, had
many children, and prospered admirably.

【Yonosuke's dialogue】
"Please continue
to watch
over me
in the future."

The kappa let his guard down and had his rear jewel extracted on the 28th day of that time. Therefore, the saying that continues to this day - "Beware of exposing your rear, today is the 28th" - began from this incident.

"Well now, he extracted it quite well for an amateur"

"To have one's rear jewel extracted while being a freeloader is an even worse deal than the proverb 'buying sake and getting one's rear cut'"

"However you look at it, snakes are skilled at entering holes, so this is naturally the Benzaiten deity at work"

"There's no danger to life, but alas, to be told that an amateur extracted my rear jewel brings shame to my household and defilement - oh, how vexing!"

From then on, that snake went to Enshū province and served under a fox called Manhei of Matsugaura. This fox's transformations were extraordinary - he usually wore a skull from Suzugamori in Bushū province. When this skull broke, he gave new orders to the snake: "I'm giving you these six ryō in leaf-coins, so go procure a skull from Suzugamori in Bushū province."

"Don't dawdle like a snake - hurry, hurry!" (meaning: don't be lazy, hurry up)

"Yes sir! With this tororo soup, I'll slither along swiftly"

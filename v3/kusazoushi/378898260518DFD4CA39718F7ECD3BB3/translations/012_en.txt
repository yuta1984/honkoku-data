That snake, hearing that the slug monster was mighty and had no enemies in the neighboring provinces, thought to somehow enter service under this slug monster. When the slug was at his hunting camp at Komaki Mountain, the snake came forward and petitioned to serve him. The many monster subordinates raised a commotion and surrounded the snake, with everyone trying to capture it, saying "Could this be a spy from the enemy side?" The snake gradually told his story, speaking openly about his circumstances without concealment, and earnestly pleaded his case. Eventually he was entrusted to an ashigaru captain and began service as a lowly servant.

"This fellow wanting to serve - what a bold notion! Who would employ a slippery character like you? How pushy!"

"You're no better than a truly blind snake - that describes you perfectly! Get back, get back!"

"How about I mess with you and make you into grilled eel over rice?"

"Now listen here, brothers, there's no need to be so cold to me. I'm an honest fellow seeking a patron to serve."

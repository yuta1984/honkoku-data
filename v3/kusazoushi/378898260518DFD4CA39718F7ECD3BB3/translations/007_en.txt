The Okazaki kappa took the small snake home and employed him. Truly, as the saying goes "a dragon shows its spirit even at three inches long," the snake naturally possessed the qualities of great courage, and moreover was superior in wisdom to such a degree that even his monster companions were amazed. The kappa, thinking him very promising, decided to test his wisdom and said playfully to the small snake, "If you can extract the jewel from my rear, I'll give you whatever reward you desire." The snake humbly accepted, saying "Tonight I shall extract the jewel from your rear."

That night the kappa could not sleep and remained vigilant. The snake deliberately prevented the kappa from sleeping by making noises outside his sleeping quarters first, then acting as if he were about to sneak in. Because of this, the kappa maintained his guard without the slightest carelessness and thus passed the entire night. When dawn came and he thought "it should be fine now," he relaxed his guard and dozed off drowsily. At that moment, the snake seized his chance, crept in, and finally extracted the jewel from the kappa's rear.

The snake, feeling bitter about receiving false accusations of stealing the hairpin, went to a pawnshop and asked, "If anyone brings such a hairpin to pawn, please notify me immediately." Sure enough, a man dressed like an ashigaru (foot soldier) came with the hairpin, saying he wanted to exchange it for ten kanmon of copper coins. When the pawnbroker informed the snake of this, she immediately came, retrieved the hairpin, captured the man, and brought him to Nekomata. Nekomata apologized profusely, and when she reported this to Namekuji, he became greatly angry, saying, "To make such accusations and suspect people without proper evidence is unbefitting of a warrior," and severely scolded Nekomata. The snake prospers with her family.

"How pitiful this is. Just because you stole the hairpin, I received suspicion, which is unbearable."

"'Not standing at the tip of a real hairpin' - this is exactly what that saying means."

"Oh my, this one is done for!"

"Well, well, he has a gentle face but turns out to be quite a brazen fellow."

"Serves him right! Let's laugh at him. Hooray, hooray!"

Around the Genkyu era (1204-1206), there was a man named Kuwata Manzo in Shamisen-bori, Kamakura. He was called Ten-ten. During this time, the customs of Kamakura had become greatly extravagant, and both samurai and townspeople had become ill-mannered. Besides Oiso Keshozaka, there were numerous pleasure quarters called okaba-sho (unlicensed prostitution areas) with many courtesan districts. In addition, beautiful women called korobigeisha (fallen geisha) who were originally amateurs could be found throughout the towns. Not only were novice pleasure-seekers abundant, but even retired men who had reached their 60th birthday (kanreki) the previous year had become dissolute, keeping geisha, drinking, and engaging in pleasure-seeking—houses that didn't indulge in such activities were rare. Originally, Ten-ten was also the son of a shamisen shop owner who had squandered his fortune, and though he knew nothing about haikai poetry, he became a haikai master on a whim based on his hastily chosen pen name "Ohai-hai," calling himself a master poet as a false name—his real occupation was that of a professional entertainer (taikomochi), and it was quite refined how he made his living this way.

Tamashin, with the fox having departed and his heart changed, thought that he too, being a merchant, was in the same business as any other. The fox intended to clear its bad reputation by revealing the truth about this matter. "Is there perhaps some other place you have an appointment with? If not, it would be best to go where you desire. I'll take responsibility for this as a lifelong sin." What started as a lie became truth, and through a small loss in the house, Umeya became fortunate.

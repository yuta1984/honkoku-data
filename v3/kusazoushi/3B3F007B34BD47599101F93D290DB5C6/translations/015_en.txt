The head of Kintarō that was displayed at the execution grounds was beaten by rain, causing the paper on top to peel back, revealing the basket underneath. Therefore, while at first everyone thought "Well, human skull bones are indeed like baskets" and no one noticed, as it gradually peeled back more and the basket's true identity became obvious, everyone was shocked. "So Mitsume has deceived us all! Come, let's take it down and show it to the priest." When his fellow demons brought it to Mitsume, the priest was greatly deflated, his face turning bright red with shame. Even so, if even Mikoshi and Mitsume cannot handle Kintarō, he's certainly not someone that ordinary demons can deal with. Not knowing what other troubles might befall them, and while they still had daylight to see their way, they all consulted together and moved away beyond Hakone.

"I thought it would turn out like this anyway. Ha ha ha ha!"

"Master Mitsume got us all worked up with his smooth talk, but indeed it was all lies. Even our group's patron deity is worthless. How absurd!"

"We should have just moved away from the beginning. Has my wisdom also become as empty as this basket? How utterly pointless!"

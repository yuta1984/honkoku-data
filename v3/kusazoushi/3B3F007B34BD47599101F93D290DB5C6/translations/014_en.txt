Since Mitsume Nyūdō (Three-eyed Priest) had fled back without any success, he couldn't make excuses to his companions. So he devised a plan and suddenly came up with an idea: he stretched paper over a mandarin orange basket, drew eyes and a nose on it, and had it carried back with great ceremony, claiming it was Kintarō's head. The priest returned with a left fan, putting on airs with an extremely smug and haughty expression. He gathered his fellow demons and boasted wildly, saying, "Now that we've defeated Kintarō, we can all go about freely even in broad daylight without worry. This is all due to our efforts." With his self-serving praise and boastful talk, he then had that mandarin basket "head" displayed ceremoniously as if it were displayed at the execution grounds, showing it to all the various monsters. Everyone was impressed, saying, "What an incredible feat for Mitsume Nyūdō, beyond what one would expect from him!"

"It smells like papier-mâché made from cheap paper."

"I am the patron deity of our monster group. I have now avenged all our comrades who were killed by that Kintarō!"

"Ah, yes yes, that's the spot, they say, but this head is lighter than it looks. It seems quite light indeed."

"Is it just my imagination, or do the eyeballs seem to be moving?"

"Even Master Mikoshi fled and returned, but Master Mitsume has achieved a great feat!"

"Look, since it's Kintarō's head, it mustn't rot, so I removed the skull bones and innards and preserved it in salt. No wonder it flutters when the wind blows."

"My, what a large head. Even just the head alone is creepy."

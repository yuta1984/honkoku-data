The arrogant man increasingly valued money above all else, thinking that socializing would only lead to waste, so he walked alone. Finding the inner mountain of Daihaku Kannon more interesting than the old Naka-no-cho district, he crossed over to Mukojima and wandered around the foothills of Akiba.

Just then, hearing what sounded like music coming from somewhere, he unknowingly made his way toward the inner mountain, where he encountered an elderly man. Even the arrogant man couldn't act too haughty and asked, "Who might you be, sir?" The old man replied, "I am one called Tori-ten who dwells in this mountain. Among my companions, the monk Kume lost his spiritual powers upon seeing white shins. If even immortal sages can be concerned with sophistication, how much more so for ordinary humans! To despise sophistication and boorishly hoard money is truly a misguided view. With my understanding of true principles, I shall work to distinguish between genuine sophistication and ordinary matters, and clear away your delusions," he began to tell his tale.

"Did you come all this way thinking of me as someone from Tachibana-cho? You too seem quite obsessed with women."

"From that way of speaking, I thought you were quite the country bumpkin, but what an unexpected misunderstanding this is."

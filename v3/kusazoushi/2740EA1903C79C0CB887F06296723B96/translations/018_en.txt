The arrogant man, thinking he was exiting through the mouse gate from the popular theater just moments before, found himself at the entrance of his own home. Wondering if it was a dream, he had no memory of sleeping. Nor did he have any memory of being deceived. Reflecting on what had transpired, he realized that being too boorish did not suit the spirit of the current times. As the Kannon Bodhisattva said in the final act, as long as one has the proper means, one can win the approval of sophisticated people. From this point forward, he abandoned both his arrogance and his miserliness, harmonizing with what others said. Though he did not reach the level of a true connoisseur of pleasure quarters, he came to be known as a reasonably sophisticated person.

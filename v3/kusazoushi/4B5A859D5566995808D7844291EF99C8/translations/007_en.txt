Mikoshi-nyudō (Portable Shrine Monk), the adopted son of a baboon, had been trying various ways to win over Ke-jorō since the day she was promoted as a featured courtesan, but she would not consent at all, so he wondered what the reason could be.

If Ke-jorō were taken by Ima-nyudō, he would have no excuse to give to the baboon who was his foster father. While he was agonizing over how to somehow get Ke-jorō into his hands and humble Ima-nyudō, they encountered each other at the pleasure quarter and got into a quarrel, which eventually led to a dispute over ransoming Ke-jorō.

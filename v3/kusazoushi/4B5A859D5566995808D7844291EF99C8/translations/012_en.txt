【Main text】
With the blind parental love that sees no faults in one's child, Furu-nyūdō wanted desperately to make his son a monster general. He gouged out his remaining single eye and gave it to his son. Then Ke-jorō said "This is truly married couple's mutual support (katame)" and gouged out the eye she had initially received, giving it to Ima-nyūdō. Now, as the honorable monster general "Three-eyed Nyūdō of Echigo Province," even his fellow monsters came to fear him.

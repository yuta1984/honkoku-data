Ima-nyūdō had been serving the hihi, but because of this, his rank among monsters was lowered below that of kyōgen performers. His father, Furu-nyūdō, secretly heard of this matter and emerged from the darkness of this world, leaving Echigo Province to wander in search of his son's whereabouts.

At that time, Ke-jorō had eloped with a kyōgen performer, following after Ima-nyūdō, and when the two were resolved to die together, they encountered Furu-nyūdō.

Being a monster, his frightening appearance was quite effective.

This scene is called jōruri, but he is not such a clever monster. Since it happened long ago, he is just an ordinary person in all respects.

【Furu-nyūdō's dialogue】
"Ima-nyūdō! Ke-jorō!"

"Ah! That voice - is it Kampahari-nyūdō? A cuckoo? Ah yes, that's right, that's right."

【Ke-jorō's dialogue】
"Before this person becomes possessed by monsters, I want to die quickly."

【Ima-nyūdō's dialogue】
"You should live on and pray for my spirit as a departed monster."

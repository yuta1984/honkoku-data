As you know, the great priest (nyūdō) of Echigo Province dearly loved his only son, whom he called "One-eyed Boy." This boy was a monster and warrior no less formidable than his father, so many monsters said to the priest: "Young One-eye has now become such a splendid monster that the priest should retire and pass the world over to One-eye." Following his companions' advice, the priest gouged out his own eye and gave it to the boy, renamed himself "One-eye Monk," and lived in retirement from the world.

[The Echigo Priest's dialogue]
I have handed the world over to the boy, but when I try to taste things, unlike in the old days, most monsters nowadays are hard to eat.

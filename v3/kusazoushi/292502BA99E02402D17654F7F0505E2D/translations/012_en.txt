The red oni had threatened his daughter and returned, but thinking that since she was a woman, he felt uneasy, wondering what might become of his oni troops, so he turned back to check on the situation. What we call surveillance in Japan is called "oni troops" over there (in the oni realm).

When the household commotion of "Okiyo has died" became clear through this sudden blow typical of concern for one's child, Momotaro too felt pity, and his resolution to hold memorial services for the daughter since he had saved the parents' lives was truly admirable.

The picture of an oni chanting the nembutsu that remains in Otsu paintings to this day comes from this red oni's karmic connection.

Since Momotaro also had need of the magic mallet, when he offered the invisibility cloak and straw raincoat, saying "I would like these to conceal myself, but since I'm returning to my country, I don't need them - please keep them all together as treasure," he left them and departed.

"Is the daughter-in-law returning already?" The daughter had been waiting, doing laundry, ever since he said "I'll return soon." This is what "doing laundry while the oni is away" refers to.

Momotaro lived harmoniously with his wife and had a child, also called Momotaro from their own seed. This child was a mischievous but sturdy boy who loved makuwa melons and ate them every day. Since Okiyo had died, Ume offered first fruits of everything as offerings, but whenever she took a slice of melon as a first offering, the child would say "Oni!" From this, the tradition arose of calling melons "oni."

Whether the peach that flowed downstream to restore youth and give birth was sent by the monkey messenger of Sanno Gongen, or was it perhaps a peach of Toho-saku? Being ordinary mortals, we cannot know - perhaps even the Queen Mother of the West dropped it.

And so they continue to live youthfully and elegantly to this day.

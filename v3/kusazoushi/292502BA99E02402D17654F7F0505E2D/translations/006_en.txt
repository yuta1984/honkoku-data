At Oni Island, having had their treasures stolen, they fell into great hardship. Everyone felt regretful and gathered in large numbers to devise various schemes to recover them, but no good plan came to mind. Finally, they realized that since ancient times, nothing could be accomplished without romantic intrigue. The downfall of the Heike clan was also due to being misled by feminine charm, as was the obstruction of the thunder god's ascetic practices - there are countless such examples. Without love, there can be no successful schemes. On Oni Island, there was a red demon's daughter, sixteen years old and beautiful, with no one who did not fall for her charms. They plotted to send her to Momotarō to make him let his guard down through love and thus recover their treasures. "Even demons are naive at sixteen" - this saying must refer to such situations.

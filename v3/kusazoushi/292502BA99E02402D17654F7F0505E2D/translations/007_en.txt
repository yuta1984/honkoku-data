It was decided through consultation to send the red demon's daughter Okiyo to Japan to retrieve their treasures, and everyone wept while cherishing their farewells. Even demons shed tears, and they grieved more than ordinary beings would. The saying "a wife's tears never freeze" refers to the stalwart demon wives, and this appears to be an example of what is meant by "women with hearts as strong as demons."

[Mother's dialogue]
Don't fret and complain, getting yourself all worked up. This is for the sake of many, for the sake of our country. That you were born with such beauty is your karma.

[Explanatory text]
That even the palanquin bearers grieve upon understanding the parents' hearts shows that "demons follow the righteous path."

[Palanquin bearer's dialogue]
You must be quite busy indeed. Please make sure no one sees you.

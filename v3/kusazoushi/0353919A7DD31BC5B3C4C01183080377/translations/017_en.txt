Aruheitou was captured through trickery and brought before Higashi-yama-dono. There, through the intercession of Kasutera no Chushi (Castella Priest) and Yokan Osho (Sweet Bean Jelly Monk), he was to change his former ways and offer an apology. Aruheitou would abandon the name "refined confection" and take the new name "Chinese confection," join the ranks of the tea ceremony founders, and commit seppuku as an apology.

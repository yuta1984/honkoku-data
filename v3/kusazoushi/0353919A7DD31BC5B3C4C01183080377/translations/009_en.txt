The treasured tea bowl of Higashi-yama-dono (Lord of Dry Confections) was bought by someone, and after various investigations, it was discovered that Aruheitou (a type of hard candy) was the buyer. The Great King of Chinese Confections, feeling urgent, sent Kaseitakusan across the sea to inquire about the whereabouts of the tea bowl.

"Our master has lost a very precious item, and even we cannot comprehend it," the Great King of Chinese Confections heard and said, "Now, in our close relationship with Japan like fish and water, for such suspicious matter to occur is truly regrettable. By whatever means, we shall investigate and clear Lord Higashi-yama's suspicions."

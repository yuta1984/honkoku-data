Little Rakugan receives the precious tea bowl from his lord and is returning home when Matsukaze, a lady-in-waiting of the inner palace, who has long harbored feelings for Rakugan, takes this good opportunity to reveal the depth of her emotions.

Rakugan is also captivated by Matsukaze's beauty and charm, and they become intimate lovers.

Konpeitō (sugar candy) is a messenger from a certain Hei, who infiltrates as Rakugan's sandal-bearer, intending to steal the treasured tea bowl of Dry Confections Mountain Lord. Since Rakugan was entrusted with it, he easily steals it and departs.

Aruheitou (hard candy) had been doing tea preparation all day for the tea ceremony, so Nikkeito (cinnamon candy) and Yokan-osho (sweet bean jelly priest) said "Although he appears soft, he's actually a hard person" and went home early. Only Gyuhi (soft rice cake confection) remained, and suggested to Aruheitou: "Let's recommend Yoshiwara. There's a wonderfully beautiful courtesan called Matsukaze who was recently introduced. Teacher, you should come along too." Aruheitou replied, "I'll melt away completely."

"Let's go quickly and stake out Naka-no-cho (a street in Yoshiwara)."

"Indeed, people are likely thinking about it right now."

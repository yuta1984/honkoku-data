Here in the vicinity of Azuma no Mori (Eastern Forest), there was a broker named Izaemon. Ki-Bun came to ask this Izaemon to help him buy out Katsuyama. This Izaemon was called "Tō-I" after taking characters from the phrase "Azuma no Mori no Higashi" (East of the Eastern Forest).

"...Katsuyama has Nara-Mo...sake...but that...can you imitate that?...I won't go either..."

"Tō-I-san, please go to the quarter now and discuss this matter."

Nara-Mo overheard this and thought, "I'll spend money and let Sukeroku play the leading role. What a clever plan!"

"Sukeroku-san, Nara-Mo and Ki-Bun are said to be competing to buy out a courtesan, but you probably can't arrange the money. Even if it's a lie, you must obtain three hundred ryō. Tonight I will strike the hand-washing basin as if it were infinite money earned in one year... [text becomes unclear] Please wait without fail. Before dawn breaks, I will strike it..."

In Katsuyama's room, there is an exchange between Sukeroku and some amusing character. "These days, infinite [wealth] doesn't worry about money's brilliance. Well then, I'm waiting, so go ahead and try it."

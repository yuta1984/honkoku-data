This Katsuyama styled her hair so well and created such an unusual hairstyle different from others that people began calling this particular hairstyle "Katsuyama" from this time onward.

Also around that time, there was a connoisseur born in Nara province named Mohei. He was now a great patron of Yoshiwara and was celebrated as "Nara-Mo." This Nara-Mo fell in love with Katsuyama's beauty and engaged in various intimate conversations with her.

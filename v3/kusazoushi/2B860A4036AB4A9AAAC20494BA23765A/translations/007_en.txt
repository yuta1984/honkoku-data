That money turned out to be counterfeit, so the tea house proprietor lay in ambush and beat Sukeroku severely.

"Hey Sukeroku, just try coming to the pleasure quarter now. You won't leave alive, you great thief! You counterfeit money user, shall I beat you to death?"

"I have absolutely no memory of using counterfeit money. Stop making such a fuss!"

Then Naramo, learning that Sukeroku would not come, negotiated with the proprietor to buy out Katsuyama himself. When Tōi heard of this, he thought, "If Naramo buys her out, it would go against my obligation to Kifumi, so I cannot let this stand."

"No matter what, proprietor, I will buy out Katsuyama!"

"Yes, yes, I'll speak with Katsuyama as well and we'll discuss it."

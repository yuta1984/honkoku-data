Kyōsen returned to Edo and told everyone this story. For the repose of Katsuyama's soul, he made three pilgrimages and erected a stone monument. From then on, he became a high-ranking monk, built a hermitage by the Sumida River, put out a lodging sign reading "Tsūraku-an Kyōsen," and lived peacefully.

"I intend to make three pilgrimages and erect a stone monument."

"Indeed, a stone monument for the repose of her soul is a good idea."

Kyōsen returned to Edo, and in his still flourishing spirits, combined with stories from Tōi, he told this tale and finally achieved the enlightenment of great wisdom.

"What a terrifying karmic connection this is!"

The recycled paper from Asakusa says:

"I appear before you all in such a dirty state, which I find quite improper, but please forgive me. First, I am always used for dirty tasks, and when I escaped from that, thinking 'Oh how delightful,' I was sold to Uchidaya tobacco shop, where after being used to wrap eighty or a hundred cigarettes for just one kin, I was bought by a servant woman and thrown into the corner of the women's quarters. While she was applying tooth-blackening nearby, she looked for rouge but couldn't find any. What karma! She grabbed me, not caring that the tobacco blew away, pressed an unsightly mirror so close to her face that her nose touched it, showing her blackened mouth, wrapped me around her finger thick as a sweet potato, opened her big mouth and puffed, then threw me into a basket, and that's how I came here.

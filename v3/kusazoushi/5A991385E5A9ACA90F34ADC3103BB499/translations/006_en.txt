The ceremonial paper confection bag says:

"While I am among my companions' clan, used for summer and winter greeting cards or New Year's courtesy letters, or even placed in letter holders, I wondered where I might be going when I was taken to a confectioner's shop. I thought something might be written on me, but instead I was placed on a printing block without proper preparation, rubbed around with something wrapped in bamboo skin until my fibers stood up, made into a bag, filled with rice crackers and such, and used as a gift for people. Even afterwards, when children wanted more, I was crumpled up and shoved into the corner of a tea chest, though I had done nothing wrong. In the end, when I thought it would be fine to become an empty bag, I was pulled out for soot cleaning and forcibly stuffed into a narrow head that I couldn't fit into, not caring that my opening was tearing, and after becoming covered in soot, I was finally crumpled up at this moment.

Boy,

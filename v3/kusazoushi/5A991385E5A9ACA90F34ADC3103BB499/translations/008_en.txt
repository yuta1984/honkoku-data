The tissue paper named Kogiku says:

"Don't you know anything about this? I was bought for four mon at Umamichi and put into a basket, stuffed between bowls and such. From inside the basket, when someone said 'hurry up, come on,' I flew out in one bound. We got off at the Daimon entrance, went up to Nakanomachi, and after drinking sake, went up to the second floor of a house with a noren curtain reading 'Chojiya.' When a courtesan appeared, the house manager and young men came to the parlor and flattered her excessively.

"Midoriya, reheat the sake"
"Master, let's have a little drink"
"How grateful this is"

Then they took out two or three pieces of me to use as appetizer plates, giving them out one by one. But thinking about it carefully, I was being used like money. If they don't even have money to spend, it would be better not to go out for pleasure. It will be a loss for the teahouse. And when the young man received me, I thought he might exchange me for money, but when he went out to the corridor, he just blew his nose with me and threw me away.

[Conversation in the lower left section]
"Tatsu-san, have some tobacco"

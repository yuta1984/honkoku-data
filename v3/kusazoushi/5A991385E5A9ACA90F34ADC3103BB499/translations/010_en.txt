The one-mon kite made of hanshi paper says:

"Though my price was cheap, I was pasted onto a one-mon kite and bought by a child who excitedly said 'buy a kite rather than eating sweets.' I was dragged around the entire town and became completely tattered. In the end, I became the cause of a children's fight, and the previous child, out of spite and to get back at someone, scribbled on me with a brush: 'Otafuku mask, is this here?'

'I don't know, Kin-san made him cry'

And so on. After being scribbled on, I was put into the house's wastepaper basket. Later, when a waste paper buyer tried to handle me roughly, scratching with his fingernails and saying 'how annoying,' he let go, and I was saved and came here together with everyone else.

[Conversations in the lower left section]
'No matter how much they're children, that's too much. There's no need to cry, you fool'

'Our guy has such a painful face'

'Toku-san, forgive him'

Might this not become even scraps of laughter for you? Entrusting the holes of Mino Ueda of various official paper people to the brush of a new author equivalent to paper scraps, it has become a one-volume booklet. However, if there are no buyers, I worry it will become like Chinese paper waste, and thinking of it as the same as scrap paper from a paper book, I only wish for your laughter throughout the long days.

Waste paper emerges from the trash basket and speaks to the other paper scraps: "Although I am particularly clean writing paper among papers, alas, when used for letters in Shimaru's pocket and things go badly, I end up cut in two and hung in the privy.

Here, a paper scrap buyer named Jūroku-bei, who daily bought up paper scraps, one night saw some form emerge from within a corner, and thinking it strange, listened intently with pricked ears.

The long motoyui (hair tie) says:

"If I could be used for major theater performances with full houses, I wouldn't have to endure such dirty treatment, but I became a standing motoyui, passed into the hands of an oil merchant, and was bought by a country maid. She tried to imitate a fine lady by using me as a decorative hair tie, but no matter how many times she tried, how much she struggled, I would break into small pieces, and she would spit on me, handling me roughly again and again."

"The tayu (courtesan) is in trouble, 'Eh, is it still the hair?'"

"What shall I do? It's been such a long time. And when it's finally done, it's all covered with decorations."

"I became pitch black from her oily hands, and she got furious, acting as if 'I should have known this wouldn't work,' getting angry and irritated. Just when I thought she would throw me away the next day, she flipped me over and used the other side. In the end, I was pieced together and used as a headband when using a hand towel, then thrown under the eaves. Sankei-sama found me while doing garden cleaning, picked me up, and put me in a basket."

"Eh, if we hurry now it will work - how frustrating!"

Here again, an elderly couple called Momojii were wondering whether their daughter would return today or tomorrow after finishing her work sending money, but unexpectedly, recently there were rumors that the fox had taken a wife and revealed crucial secrets, so they consulted about reporting this matter loyally to Mikoshi-nyūdō.

"If the money-sending work had truly been completed, we would have received reward money, and both of us could have retired and enjoyed ourselves by deceiving people with temporary work like hatimachi. But now things have come to this."

"Though they say 'love is beyond reason,' what a slovenly fellow. We cannot let this slide. We must report to Lord Nyūdō."

Based on Momojii's loyal report, Mikoshi-nyūdō became greatly enraged and resolved, "Now I shall gather all the monsters and attack to capture them."

Already dressed for that day in black silk-laced armor with a dōji-gōshi patterned hitatare, holding an iron staff at an angle, extending his neck about three shaku longer than usual, he gives orders to the various monsters.

"How thoughtful of me. I've worn armor for the first time, but this thing will be a bit heavy and difficult to vanish with when it's time to disappear."

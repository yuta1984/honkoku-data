On the fox's side, recently at the suggestion of a ubume (birthing spirit), he had taken in a beautiful snow woman and had relaxed his war preparations somewhat, taking a breather.

The snow woman had been sent as an agent by Mikoshi-nyūdō, and although there were many good opportunities with the fox, the fox found this woman suspicious. Since he had transformed into a great lover, the snow woman instead became enchanted by the fox's charm and revealed all of Mikoshi-nyūdō's plans.

"Tanuki-san, I was told to kill you, then when it's cold, place you by the fire to make your testicles expand, insert heated stones, and kill you. In exchange for revealing this crucial secret, please help me become husband and wife with Fox-san."

"You know well about my testicles expanding. Can't let my guard down. Your request - agreed, agreed."

【Fox's dialogue】
"What? You intend to cut off my head? How disturbing."

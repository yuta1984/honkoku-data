One should not speak of demons in the dark night, nor should one gossip about people in broad daylight. Not to speak of supernatural forces and strange spirits - this is the teaching of the gentleman, a little from the Analects.

Starting with the portable shrine and the rain pavilion, everyone entered the capital, and as the day was already declining, when the hundred lamp wicks became just one wick and it was extinguished, something fell with a clatter from the sliding window. Looking closely to see if it was a demon or a person, because it was a shallow rice field of Sujikuma, everyone crushed the lanterns along with their livers, and like a one-mon kite whose string had been cut, the monsters disappeared, floating away lightly.

Indeed, if one sees the strange and is not disturbed by it, then there is nothing strange. What are called evil spirits and heretics are nothing other than disloyal and unfilial people.

In connection with this, young masters, do not imitate bad behavior. What about the realm, the realm.

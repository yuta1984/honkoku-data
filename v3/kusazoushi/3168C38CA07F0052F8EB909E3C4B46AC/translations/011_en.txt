A fox and a tanuki, traveling together, came out into the town around dusk out of boredom and were strolling about when they caught a delicious smell from behind some reed screens. Thinking it might be fried tofu with mouse, they peered in, only to discover it was a stall selling boiled dog, boar, and deer meat. The tanuki panicked, wanting to flee before being made into tanuki soup, while the fox feared being roasted to a golden-brown "fox color" and wanted to run away.

♪By chance we came here and met with such a fate. We won't come around here anymore, no no!

Together, the two were thoroughly frightened (playing on "kori-kori," the sound of being scared, which also contains the characters for fox and tanuki).

A kappa also came up onto the riverbank, walking around hoping to drag away any children he might find, when he came upon a tea stall displaying a sign showing dried kappa (one of his own kind). His heart sank into his belly and he fled in terror.

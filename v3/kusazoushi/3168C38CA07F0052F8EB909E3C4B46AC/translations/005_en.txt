Curious foxes and raccoon dogs went to a warrior's mansion to test and see what would happen, bringing along their monster friends. When they looked, the atmosphere was imposingly resonant, the shade was refreshingly invigorating, and while they were wondering eerily what kind of beings would appear and trying to test this, it seemed to be already the hour of the horse (noon). A sake-reeking wind blew sideways, and when the curtain of clouds was pulled open, behold, a great one-eyed nyudo appeared like a grand Satsuma performance, and when two dignified figures appeared, the monsters crushed their livers along with their lunch of fried rice, completely losing their will to transform. Among them, the raccoon dogs had their testicles' prosperity taken by eight people's worth, yet fled home without seeing even one act. This anachronism is truly the greatest wonder.

[Explanation]
That is to say, the one who spoke as the one-eyed one was Kamakura no Gon Goro Kagemasa, and the one who spoke as the great nyudo was Musashibo Benkei.

"It's not uncouth, for drunkards"

"I don't understand what kind of kyogen this is. It's like taking out helmet dolls from a cellar."

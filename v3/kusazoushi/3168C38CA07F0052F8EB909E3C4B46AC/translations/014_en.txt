Things without lower bodies include ghosts, as well as puppet handlers' upper and lower puppets, the torii of Mukōjima, and lanterns with face shadows. From the monsters' perspective, among things without lower bodies, nothing is more terrifying than a scarecrow. When fear takes hold and puts on a hat, the heart's bow loses focus, and even the straw raincoat bristles with terror. What becomes of this confusion led astray by foxes - the earthly desires, the chill from the hollow - if such mistakes occur, they can crush one's spirit.

Therefore, an old poem says:
"The scarecrow guarding the mountain rice field has no skill, but thinking it real, one still keeps away"

A broad-chested person can drink anything without worry. If their rear end is as wide as their chest, there's no problem with things getting stuck in the chest, and surely they think nothing of gourd skin along with their pleasures. After a thousand years in rivers, a thousand years in mountains, a thousand years in seas, if one obtains the wood of the righteous heaven, monsters fear that things will pass through. Giant serpents curl their crimson tongues in fear, chanting "Great serpent, Namu Butsu, Namu Butsu" ten times.

There's also something called "basket ears" - ear holes like funnels, with a river beside them, so whatever is heard just flows right through.

♪In my foolish opinion, for a snow woman, disappearing would seem more efficient than fleeing.

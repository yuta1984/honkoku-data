Recently, I have been writing this humorous fiction. Its purpose is like a kappa's fart bubble, and also resembles a raccoon dog's snoring. When folded, it makes two volumes; when opened, it has ten pages. If there are chipped plates like O-Kiku's, there are also excess heads like those of Mikoshi-no-matsu. Thus, borrowing the light of firefly battles and holding up the lantern of the snow woman, taking up the brush of Kirikaburo, pointlessly reducing the oil in a single lamp, putting on a fox-colored cover, and moreover using a three-eyed awl for binding. The words are like the diary of a monster mansion, and the pictures are equal to the simple prints of a curiosity tea house. On mornings with fishy winds and evenings with drizzling rain, for lonely children, please look at this book and have some tea.

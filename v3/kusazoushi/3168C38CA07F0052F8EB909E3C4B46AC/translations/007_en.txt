On the chaotic evening of Setsubun, thinking there might be houses that forgot to throw beans, a demon wanders around peering into doorways like a peddler selling exorcism services. Seeing what appears to be a marital quarrel, with the sound of a mortar striking and a pestle breaking, going up and down, thinking that with this commotion the bean-throwing must be over, the demon shuffles in to see. But what is this? The wife has grown horns of jealousy, and in her frenzy the husband calmly handles a terrible snake. Though the demon finds this frightening, it cannot leave.

Like watching madmen in Sanzeisō divination, the demon stands frozen between the two.

"This demon, being a demon with some sensitivity, composes a poem:"
"Though we say 'Fortune in' and scatter beans, foolishness - the demon in the heart - will not flee"

[The demon says:]
"Ah, both the tea bowl and mortar are smashed to pieces. This looks like good fortune for pottery repair work"

[The demon says:]
"Without making wordplay about dyeing, if just one of you would stay quiet, it would be fine. It's really like touching a taut surface"

"Your snake-handling isn't limited to tonight. You completely ignore what people say, and won't come out in any island, arguing about reasons is just petty debate"

[Note: "using snakes" = being lazy/idle]

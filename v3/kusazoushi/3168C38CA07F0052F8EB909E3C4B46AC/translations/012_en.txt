For a cat to shapeshift is far more troublesome than putting on seaweed disguises. Hand towels and nose dishes are scarce, and though they may occasionally hang in rouge shops, they are quite beyond the reach of a cat's paws. What they still hope for are the cloth napkins from confectionery shops, but these are sold out, making transformation difficult. In the end, cats are often made fools of by humans - when a careless maid breaks tea bowls or lidded dishes, or drops things from shelves while trying to arrange trinkets at a sundry goods store, cats are blamed for crimes they didn't commit, yet have no way to make excuses. When they happen to take an afternoon nap, mischievous little devils torment them with growling sounds, so they bite back and leap up, placing their paws on their chest. When cats are tormented like this, they can't even be called dogs, so making mouse squeaking sounds is a good strategy.

♪Even cat dreams have various methods of divination, and they dislike dreams of fish and rice. Instead, this likely means an empty belly. For New Year's first dreams, there's something called "ichi-bushi" (one flake), with dried bonito flakes being first: first bonito, second sunny spot, third mouse - these are the most auspicious dreams.

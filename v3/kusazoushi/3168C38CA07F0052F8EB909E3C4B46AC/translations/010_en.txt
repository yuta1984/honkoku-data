The Mikoshi-nyudo had not looked down upon people for a long time, so he thought he would try looking down a little, but humans were so frightening that he ventured out walking only in places with no foot traffic. However, since it was a bustling area, there were few truly desolate places. He heard there was a place called "Okuyama" (Deep Mountains), and thinking that such deep mountain valleys would surely be eerily desolate, he came searching for it. But when he suddenly turned around, there stood a human about ten feet tall. Since this was the first time Mikoshi-nyudo had ever been looked down upon by someone, he cried "Kyaa!" and his eyes rolled back.

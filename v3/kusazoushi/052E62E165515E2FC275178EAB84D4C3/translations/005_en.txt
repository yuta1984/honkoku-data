When that giant demon tried to devour and kill Kamada Matahachi, he understood the situation and drew his sword,

finally cutting it down. When he looked closely, it was a large old tanuki (raccoon dog).

"How's that! Did you see Matahachi's skill? Hey there!"

The tanuki suffered in agony, its cries were terrible as it screamed with eyes nearly bursting.

The monster, intending to deceive Matahachi, transformed into his aunt and entered the house.

"How good that Matahachi has come! I was feeling so lonely. Come, please enter here."

Kamada Matahachi finally arrived at his aunt's gate and told her about what had happened.

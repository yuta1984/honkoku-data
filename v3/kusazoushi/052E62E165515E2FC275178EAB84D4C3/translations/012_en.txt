Silk merchant Kaemon, having learned of the cat's deeds from Kamata Matahachi's story, still wanted to test it further and secretly observed the situation.

"Indeed, indeed. There, there - it's definitely the work of that cat. No wonder she shuts herself away in dark places and won't let the servants come near. That makes perfect sense now. I understand completely."

Kaemon's daughter Oshiga becomes frightened seeing the old woman's condition.

"Oh, how terrifying, how terrifying!"

The cat had devoured Kaemon's mother, transformed into her likeness, retreated to dark places, and ate the morning and evening meals while keeping the servants at a distance.

"Meow meow meow meow meow. Rather than deal with the trouble of servants and such while disguised as mother, pretending to have an eye disease to avoid people - how clever indeed!"

Kaemon's daughter Oshiga falls for Matahachi - what a fine young man.

Matahachi tells Kaemon about what he witnessed.

"Is the cat you cherished so dearly still around?"

"That cat has disappeared without a trace. Since then, my mother has been suffering from eye problems, dislikes bright places, and stays constantly in dark places. I am truly grateful for your kind warning. Let me tell you the details."

Based on Kamata Matahachi's story, Kaemon had them dig around the garden of the retirement quarters, and to their great shock, they found the corpse of his mother as well as the body of a female servant who had gone missing.

"So it was the cat's doing," he thinks.

"Though I knew nothing of this, what a terrible thing."

Here was a man called Kamada Matahachi, a strongman renowned throughout the neighboring provinces. In his childhood, he kept a white chicken.

A dog from the neighboring house killed and ate that chicken.

Matahachi's wet nurse, saying "How outrageous!", was startled by the bird's cry and rushed out to chase the dog, but the chicken was ultimately killed and eaten.

"Cursed beast! When young master Matahachi returns, there will be terrible consequences."
A child threw stones at it to chase it away, but this dog [text unclear] and then departed.

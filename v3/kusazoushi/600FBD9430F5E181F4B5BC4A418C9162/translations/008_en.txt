"No, how annoying this is. When I try to sleep, first the debt collectors get angry, and on top of that they complain they can't see, as if they slept embracing blind masseurs and palanquin bearers. There's no end to their grumbling."

Segawa inquires based on last night's situation:

"Mizu-san, you must have had quite a troublesome time last night. What a terrible mess that was. How is the timing for the big dawn tide now? I want you to go home quickly."

"What nerve you have to say that."

Toriyama became so infatuated with Segawa that the more he called on her, the more excited he became, so now even his way of speaking has deteriorated. He thinks constantly about arranging money, but nowadays there are few customers who will pay three ryō for a night's pleasure. Finally, through various schemes, he managed to arrange about twenty ryō. However, thinking that if he used this money to call on Segawa, he would again be in difficulty with later payments, he suddenly lent these twenty ryō to one of the impoverished courtesans in the brothel, with a thirty-day limit agreement and some eye-opening interest rate.

"Toriyama-san, please lend me three ryō as well. I have prospects in twenty-eight or twenty-nine days."

"I'll also go to Naka-no-chō again."

"Sugawara-san also said, 'Please ask for about five ryō for me.'"

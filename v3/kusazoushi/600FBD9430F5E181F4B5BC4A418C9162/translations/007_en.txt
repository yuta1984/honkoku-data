"Well, go to sleep. Since tonight's customer isn't coming anymore, will you meet with me?"

"No, if only that person doesn't come, I want to meet you however possible. But my circumstances are such that I'm not easily accepted by people like you. I'm getting fed up with it. Meeting once or twice only adds to my longing, so I engage in such pointless diversions to try to forget, or so I think. This fellow has come to me, I think, just creating pretexts for entertainment."

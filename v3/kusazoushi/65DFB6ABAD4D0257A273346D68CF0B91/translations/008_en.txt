In Nishi no Kubo
An old man named
Kintayū
From Kanda

Gave his daughter
To Yokichi, afraid
They lived harmoniously
Together, but
For some reason
He dismissed her
So one connection
Cannot clear
His doubts
And he ponders

Something that
Makes no sense at all

The mother
Worries that her daughter
Might have fallen
Ill

That's Yokichi, so they say

In Naka-no-cho
Running a drinking establishment

Yokichi is a man
Who gets around in society, and his wife's
Rumors have long been known
Becoming a laughingstock
Wherever he goes, so goes the gossip
Though it's a misunderstanding
I feel very
Sorry for him
〽Mr. Yokichi
Prohibited it
How ridiculous

Everyone
Looks at Yokichi and laughs

Seventh year of An'ei, year of the earth dog (1778)
Welcoming the unchanging spring at Ryōbashi

The New Year's water, with spirits light and cheerful
At Kuruma Well

Each year to ward off misfortunes, at Gion
Festival, they have the hayashi performers carry protective amulets
The children's samurai and the young masters'
Footwork brings joy to the publishers as well

Hayashi performers
indeed

At Kanda's
Streets
Waiwai
Waiwai
Yo!

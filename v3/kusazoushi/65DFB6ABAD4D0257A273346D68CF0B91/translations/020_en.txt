Yokichi lived harmoniously with his wife as a married couple and had a child. With the sentiment that the world was good, they named the child "Yoshiyoshi" (Good World). Since Kanda Myōjin is their tutelary deity, they took the child there for the shrine visit. Thanks to this Yoshiyoshi, the couple has continued to live harmoniously together to this day.

This was a tale of a blessed reign.

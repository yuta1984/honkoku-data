Though Yokichi's
Rumors had
Become the talk
Of the town
Even his own
Household members
Were gossiping jealously

Truly
That

Mistress
To tell
Her

Yokichi, afraid of his wife
Became the subject of unexpected
Public gossip
And though it's terribly
Pitiful, you cannot
Put doors on people's mouths
With nowhere
To turn

He wrote
A divorce letter
And sent his wife back
To her family home

It cannot
Be helped

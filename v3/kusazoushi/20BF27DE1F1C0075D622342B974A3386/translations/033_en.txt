No matter how much one may be a powerful person of the current age, you cannot succeed with just one tree alone. Through what each opponent brings to bear, naturally consequences will come. Ginseng may be a capable being, but with just one part alone, no price can be commanded. If you think to join with other medicinal herb merchants and compete together, it becomes a reminder for each to exercise restraint.

Therefore, as the saying goes, when a tree is tall it is broken by the wind, and when a person is wise they are destroyed by slander - this is the primary place for caution. Lord Ginkgo, Lord Mulberry, and Lord Cotton too - as their branches spread wider year by year, they often behave as if looking down on people. With the spirit of five parts in a one-inch plant, there are two approaches: places that employ and favor young trees, and places that praise ancient trees. Ancient trees cannot simply be dismissed. Just as there are garden pines that are loved more the more they sulk, beauty alone is not something to boast about, nor is strength alone the key to success.

Announcement
Attention, attention! Though it may seem presumptuous, we make this announcement from Mount Hakone. Now, on this occasion, at the shrine of our mountain's gongen deity, we hold a divine celebration, and the plants and trees of the mountaintop gather to perform kabuki theater. The spirits of tachibana orange, mulberry, ginkgo, and paper mulberry trees all come forth without exception to serve and present a performance for your viewing. However, the ginkgo spirit and the paper mulberry blossom have started

a deep-rooted quarrel, causing all the trees' branches and leaves to be in uproar. We will summarize this situation and present it as follows for your viewing. Please regard it in this light.

　　We especially wish to say:
Though this poor long announcement may hinder the comic performance, the plant and tree spirits, from high to low, all receive your gracious favor

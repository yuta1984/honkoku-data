What grudge causes you to hate Lord Kōzo? And though you say Lord Zenmai of the leaf base is bad, there is plenty of money that could be given if one were to give it, yet making it appear disgraceful to Lord Kōzo and scheming to make oneself shine naturally - this too arose from being in league with Lord Ginkgo. No matter how gentle and soft a flower Kōzo's heart may be, it will not harmonize with such things. How detestable! The financial arrangements and calculations are all mechanical contrivances, so Lord Zenmai's position at the leaf base is indeed a harsh matter. Look there! Lord Kōzo lines up such boastful words - if there were good excuses, it would be better to speak them. That not a single word comes out means everyone is hiding behind tree leaves. Lord Ginkgo is the worst of all. If one is a tree that could become the tree leader, then being in a position to admonish the misconduct of other plants and trees, one should not be so unruly.

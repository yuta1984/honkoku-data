The sky was completely clear without a speck of dust, with a light blue-green color that was slightly darker in circles, and when clouds like the finest sky-blue ink wash appeared, they immediately grabbed Densuke and the clouds rose high into the distance. Wondering what this was about, when he looked at the face, he saw it had a high nose, wore a hood, and was wearing tatsuke (work pants), and though he thought this must be some kind of messenger, perhaps a mountain monk, he wondered if it might be that woman, and didn't move a muscle. Though it was his first such journey, there was no need to worry about boat fares or palanquin fees, no gratuities were demanded, and after being carried about twenty ri, they rested briefly on the treetops. At this time Densuke hurt his bottom on a cedar tree, but being a man experienced in such matters, he put both hands down and said, "I have not yet offered my greetings. I have been so rude in this matter, your hands must surely be quite tired."

To this she replied, "Not at all, this is nothing. You probably don't yet understand the situation. I'm taking you along due to my boss's whim. You've probably never traveled on such an elegant long journey. You don't need horses even for the eight ri of Hakone, and there's no worry about being stopped at the Ōi River. Feel free to sightsee to your heart's content," she said as they continued on. "Just hearing about it makes it seem frightening, but if you spend even a little time with it, it's actually quite gentle and charming."

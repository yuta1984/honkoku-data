Densuke cleverly maneuvered among the arrogant middle-ranking servants and was assigned by the tengu leaders to handle tailoring needs and manage the subordinates.

Generally speaking, the tailoring for sub-leaders should follow this logic: All these leaf-tengu do not have natural noses, but rather ones attached like high pickled vegetables. Though their hearts are full of pride, some have noses lower than average.

Densuke devised a plan for this situation and distributed one item each to everyone as preparation for when mountain dwellers might discover them. When mountain folk wear these tailored items in the mountains, people at the foot of the mountain might mistake them for tengu. Since the small tengu lack proper masks, they all took on the appearance of large tengu.

[Written notes below the picture]
"If children saw my appearance, they would ask for protective amulets."

"Densuke drinks hot sake, and since not one of them is a poor drinker, all their faces are red. The small tengu are blue. Even the blue ones are strong drinkers."

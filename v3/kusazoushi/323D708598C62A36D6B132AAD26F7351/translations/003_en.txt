Here there was a man called Densuke who was a taikomochi (professional entertainer). Although it was indeed his trade, he was easy-going and eloquent, and at any banquet hall he would enliven the gathering, holding his nose high as he performed his duties at the party. This man had the habit of liking hot sake, and when he drank heavily his eyes would become fixed and he would show signs of arrogance - no matter what kind of masterless samurai or ruffian it was, none would dare contradict his way.

One time, when he was pleasantly drunk and had gone up onto the roof of a teahouse to cool off, the wind that came blowing softly was very fishy-smelling. At first he thought it might be the smell from Odawara-chō or Shinba, but after that he was somewhat drowsily gazing at the sky.

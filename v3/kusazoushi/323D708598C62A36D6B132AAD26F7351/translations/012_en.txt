For eight million years, there had never been female tengu, but because of Densuke's persuasive words, they finally decided to create female tengu. They set up a meeting deep in the mountains of Kurama, and with Zenki of Omine taking the lead, along with Katsuragi, Takama, Hira, Yoshikawa, and Takao, they decided in council to bring conceited people into their way - with the extremely wicked intention of abducting them.

However, abducting women would surely give them a bad reputation in society. If people thought "they're lucky and cunning, probably doing it for money," that would be truly pitiful. It would be fine to think they're abducting them because of their arrogance, but since people's tongues would inevitably find fault, even the tengu are quite shy by nature. They decided Densuke would be best for this job, seeing his lack of feminine wiles and assigning him the task.

Besides this, there are numerous conceited fashionable men, extravagantly dressed, but if they were to abduct women and then elope on the spot, that wouldn't be proper either. Being attentive to such complicated situations, being thorough in everything without oversight - "like a tengu" is indeed a well-made comparison.

"Regarding the reputation concerning the world's conceited people, I'm grateful in every respect"

Upon hearing the logic that "there are no female tengu," [someone responds]: "We too thought so, but you made them companions. The arrogance of women, their excessive behavior, and making such a big deal of what should be shameful - this is somewhat suspicious." When pressed and accused of favoring women, [he] blushes with embarrassment and says, "It's not like that."

"Then let's go together and see for ourselves." From a high place, he shows the women at the tea houses, starting with the young ladies: wearing only three layers of "korou," "jima-shou," and plain silk in various colors and white, with red only on their lips as lipstick. Like the audience with the sick Sukezune - how arrogant they all are! Please pay close attention to the tobacco. At first, smoke comes out prettier than flowers, but later they blow rings from their mouths. Following this explanation, even the tengu are amazed.

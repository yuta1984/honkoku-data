What Densuke says also makes sense. The "good illness among illnesses" he speaks of is the "wanting-to-possess disease." "Even when cold, those who stay up through the night changing clothes" - this is a good verse. When it gets a little cold, without regard for society, they dress in layers obsessively. Even when it's hot, they outdo others. From early March, with bamboo hats and such, women walk waving fans like decorative offerings. From the opposite direction come people in flashy, constantly changing outfits. What was visible last year were silk garments with gleaming family crests; the following year, small-sleeved kimono with crimson linings appear. Even before they can afford the obi, they wear wide-sleeved head coverings.

If you call this level of behavior arrogant, then it is arrogant, and it's dangerous to the eyes. Lately, even mothers say of their daughters, "She's grown taller than a child." Indeed, this is undeniable. However, when such daughters have children, they'll eventually reach even to India [in their pretensions]. At that time, you too should take care not to have your noses pinched, and this frightens even the tengu-sama. Hey Densuke, what a sharp tongue you have!

She looks just like the new bride.

Parent, what an outrageous way to tuck up [the kimono]!

Sister is doing some needlework in return.

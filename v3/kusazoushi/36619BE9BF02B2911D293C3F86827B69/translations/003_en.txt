The Parasite Within (Shishi Shinchū no Mushi) 《According to Kagogawa Honzō and Kōmoku》

The "parasite within" has a head like a hanging lantern, wings like a spider's web, and a tail shaped like a fan. It always makes its dwelling under the veranda and feeds on octopus and small fish. Its cry sounds like "yuradono-dono." Someone is said to have used a hairpin as a shuriken to kill this creature and threw it into the Kamo River. This insect particularly dislikes rusty swords. Essentially, this creature manifests in a household, reduces that household's fortune by half, and plots to destroy the family. It is a creature that extremely favors injustice and evil. It is a detestable and fearsome insect.

This is described in detail in Act VII of "Kanadehon Chūshingura," but I will omit it here.

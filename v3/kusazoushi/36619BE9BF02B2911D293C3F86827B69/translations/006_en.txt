The Ditch Snake

This snake appears every year from various ditches after the Fuji Festival on the first day of the sixth month.
Its eyes are like brass studs, its tongue and tail-sword are red like pickled plums, and its body shines golden like wheat straw.
Though it has no legs, it coils around anything well.
There are large ones and small ones - it's a snake that isn't frightening at all.

The snake says:
"My lady, when shall we go to bed? Wait a moment, I'm just a snake, snake"

【Right page bottom, woman's dialogue】
"Oh how frightening! Help me!"

The young servant says:
"The road is muddy, damn it all, can't escape from the snake"

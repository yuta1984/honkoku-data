Heiki Crab (Calm/Composed Crab) 《According to the Great Tale of the Heike》

The Heiki crab is said to have originated long ago during the turmoil of the Jūei era, when the entire Heike clan perished in the waves of the western sea. The resentful spirits of the males became Heike crabs, while those of the females became Heiki crabs. The shell resembles a woman's face, the claws look like Heike hair ties, and the legs are like別嚢 hairpins. The females resemble hair knots. Even when mountains collapse or similar disasters occur, they remain calm (heiki), which is why they are named thus.

They are crabs that constantly oppose people and always walk sideways in everything they do. They are deeply suspicious, hiding swords in their hearts, and are very jealous. They immediately want to dominate the male crabs. Therefore, even fishermen fear them and dare not approach. They are crabs to be feared and treated with caution.

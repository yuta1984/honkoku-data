Fingernail Fire

The "fingernail fire" is the vengeful spirit of those with great greed.
This occurs when someone who spent their entire life pursuing profits contrary to divine will, engaging only in impure acts that tormented their soul, and accumulating much wealth, falls into the Dark Hell after death. Lost in the darkness of their own greed, they light fires on their fingernails like this, seeking the money they left behind in this world.
Is this not a most wretched thing?

What a terrifying obsession!

Udongge Flower

The udongge flower is said to bloom once every three thousand years. Though it is not as rare in the world as the legendary udumbara flower, few possess such profound flavor. The source of this flower is near the "himokawa" (flat noodles), with small leaves like cut wheat, flowers that bloom in tube-like shapes, and bearing fruit resembling pepper.

The line spoken by the Soga brothers about "waiting for the udongge flower to bloom" refers to this flower. [Note]

"What a rare flower this is! I'd like to take this potted plant and set up my noodle stall in an even better location."

[Note: This derives from the revenge speech in the Tale of the Soga Brothers, expressing the difficulty of encountering one's enemy: "Like a blind turtle finding a floating log, like the udumbara flower we have waited to see bloom - today, right now. Our hardships and suffering have been worthwhile; how joyful to see our enemy today!"]

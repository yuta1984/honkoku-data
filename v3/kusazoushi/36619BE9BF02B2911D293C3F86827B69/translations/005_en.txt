According to the Kabuki Sankai Zue (Kabuki Three-Story Illustrated Guide):

The human-faced catfish appears in theaters when the yang energy first emerges during ichiyō raifuku (the return of positive energy). It allies with the kugeaku (court noble villains) and commits various evil deeds. For the jitsugotoshi (virtuous character actors), it is extremely toxic.

If one is affected by this fish's poison, one should apply Ichikawa Danjūrō moxa thoroughly. It will immediately neutralize the poison.
Also, when this fish's bone gets stuck, one should chant "shibaraku" three times while stroking the throat. It will come out miraculously.
Indeed, this is an outrageous poisonous fish.

While the earthquake catfish says "banzairaku-raku" (long live joy), this catfish immediately flees when one says "shibaraku."

♪If I caught it, it would make a good sideshow attraction
If I had known this, I should have brought a gourd

【Note: A gourd for catching catfish. A pun based on the ancient Zen painting theme "Hyōnenzu" (gourd and catfish)】

The Double-Headed Brush

The double-headed brush always hides and dwells in the bosoms of poets, verse composers, and haikai masters. During flower season and beautiful moonlit times, many appear and devour colored paper and poem cards (tanzaku). Also, when they see people's fans, they indiscriminately snatch and devour them.

The Long-Armed Monkey

The enkō monkey tries to catch the moon's reflection in water, but this long-armed monkey tries to steal money from purses. Its cry resembles that of the "buppōsō" (three-jeweled bird), and along this highway it cries "bussō-bussō" (dangerous-dangerous).

It lives in the mountains of Miyako Yamazaki. Long ago, a hunter named Hayano Kanpei shot it down with a gun.

Well, well, what a long-armed monkey! It's wearing long-armed ashida (wooden clogs) worth thirty-eight mon.

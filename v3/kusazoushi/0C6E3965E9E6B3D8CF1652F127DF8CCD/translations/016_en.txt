The young master's dissolute lifestyle was the work of the head clerk Chuji, who took advantage of this opportunity to steal money from many retainers, thinking no one would know. He became increasingly brazen, but although those around him didn't know, Heaven was aware, and his misdeeds were revealed through small matters. Though the earnings from courtesan patronage were hard to collect, he was beaten out with split bamboo, but without any saving grace, the entire household spoke in unison, calling out only "Sotaro."

[Dialogue]
"Just like the dialogue in illustrated books, the base of a great tree grows properly"

"Chuji! Just like a octopus beginning to eat, strike with split bamboo"

When they intended to return the money they had profited, they found that even after returning the amount equivalent to twice the earnings from sumo tournaments, people were calling out "it's still not enough!" So when returning money wasn't sufficient, they would supplement with additional payments, but even with such sluggish investigation and devising solutions, they remained carefree.

However, they made the much-desired New Year's Eve their finale and rained down every last bit (one bu) of their ill-gotten gains.

"What a good year-end!" refers to the money, and indeed there could be no better year-end than this. By evening, all debts were completely settled, people could buy whatever they wished, there was no one in financial danger, and voices saying "What a wonderful year-end!" and laughter echoed up to heaven.

The thunder and wind gods' rebellion was now resolved, and they would have a good New Year.

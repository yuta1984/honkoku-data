The height of heaven is said to be 5,784,000 jō, 1 shaku, 3 sun, and 2 bu - an incredibly high place, so no one knows it in detail. Yet it can be seen and known to the eye, but since it is somewhat distant, it is quite reasonable that you may not be familiar with it. Those who call themselves "senban sakusha" (popular fiction writers) must be knowledgeable about everything in detail. You may think this makes everything quite demanding. Nevertheless, among the many things, please forgive the usual mistakes like confusing "Tenjiku" with "tenchoku" and kindly peruse this work.

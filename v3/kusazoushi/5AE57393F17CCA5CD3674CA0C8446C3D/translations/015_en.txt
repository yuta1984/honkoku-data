From this most unusual New Year's Eve until the dawning spring, with favorable wind and rain conditions throughout, a bountiful harvest is guaranteed. As the song of the celestial maiden states, "Of things truthful in heaven," if one knows of heaven's affairs but does not speak of them, one becomes long-lived - so the saying goes, but one must say "fine weather." When it rains for two days for the sake of the rice fields, people complain about the troublesome weather and speak ill of it, so the Thunder God gets angry and brings down more rain than needed. Therefore, one should not speak of heavenly matters. In any case, there is no lack of tact over there.

This spring of the highest supreme good fortune is indeed auspicious.

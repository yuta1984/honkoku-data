Looking down from heaven, since it encompasses the three thousand worlds, it is unimaginably vast. However, since they are beings who walk on clouds, they walk without any hardship. Not only cherry blossoms, but everything appears as if one cannot distinguish whether it's clouds or flowers. Everything else follows their preferences, and there are countless ways of enjoying refined pleasures. They particularly like to observe bustling places, and immediately find Edo interesting. From Nihonbashi to Sakai-cho, if you think the people there are sophisticated, then the crowds in Asakusa are...

If you think they might be rough, the area around Shiba is also so crowded you cannot push through. Wherever you look, there are so many people it's dizzying. Even when viewing interesting and beautiful things carelessly, since they have heard the story of the sage Kume, they are quite cautious, so except for the thunder god, no one has ever fallen. When they see eligible bachelors, they feel envious. When asked, they say it's quite popular. Though Hachijo silk may appear in great quantities and look very fine, both imitation and genuine Hachijo silk appear the same. The real viewing becomes a burden, and those who endure it cover their ears to the voices of fortune-tellers, while treating the cuckoo's voice as a pleasant breeze.

[Dialogue]

Four (?) fifty-three number came out as one-two.

Oh, that's dangerous!

Don't go betting on that one!

The banner of time
Kamo no Jiro fighting valiantly
The failures of both
Shinra Saburo, and also
accusing Shinra Saburo and
Shiraito Hime of adultery,
which later becomes
an obstacle
Prince Chikahito becomes
enraged, telling Kiyotsuna
to behead everyone,
and just as he tries to
pull down Hachiman Taro's
tablet, "Shibaraku!"
[Kabuki dramatic pause call]
Great success!

[Old character notation for search purposes: 伊達錦對将 : Morita-za Theater]

[The cover is decorated with scattered designs of the character "kotobuki" (longevity) and a crest featuring three "hito" (person) characters arranged together. This is Nakazō's substitute crest, designed with three "person" characters. It is said to embody his wish to become one of the "three great actors" in Edo. Nakazō was originally an actor at the Ichimura-za theater, but due to disputes, he transferred to the Morita-za theater starting with this play.

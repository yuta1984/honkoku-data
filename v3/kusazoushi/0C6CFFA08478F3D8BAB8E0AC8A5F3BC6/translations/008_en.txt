Telling the story, he breaks the twin-leaf flute that would reveal the true identity of Ninomiya Genroku's father's enemy, declaring that the enemy is his brother Yasumasa. He tramples to death the wife who remonstrated with him and attempts to abduct Izumi Shikibu. When he fights against the three men - Yasumasa, Suetake, and Genroku - attempting to execute them, and forcibly tries to tear up the stolen late Emperor's testament, Yasumasa recovers the testament and beheads him.

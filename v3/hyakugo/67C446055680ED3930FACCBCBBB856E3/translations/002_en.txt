Regarding the matter of unpaid annual tribute (nengu) from Nishigo Omura-kushi village for the previous year, as reported by Sadayuki, the estate manager (zasso) of Murakushi-sho in Totomi Province, which is held by Saisho-koin Temple: The official letter (kyosho) dated the fourth day of the eighth month arrived on the seventh day of this month, and I have respectfully read it.

As stated in the complaint, orders have been issued twice before. However, aside from this recent official letter delivered by the messenger, nothing else has arrived. In any case, as recorded in the same document, I have handled two portions of the matter, but regarding the remaining portion, I will urgently reach a settlement and ensure complete payment. I humbly report this matter to you. With utmost respect and humility.

Ninth day of the ninth month, second year of Gentoku [1330]

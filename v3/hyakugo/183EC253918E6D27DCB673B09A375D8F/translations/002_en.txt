I humbly request appointment to the position of deputy administrator (daikan) for the proprietor's portion of Niimi Estate in Bitchū Province, a holding of Tōji Temple.

Article 1: Although the deputy administrator position for this estate was appointed to Sagami temple master (Zōshūbō) through the temple's benevolence, since it is in a distant province, I, Shigeyasu, have been contracted through private arrangement, and therefore must not be negligent in any matter.

Article 2: Regarding public duties, regardless of drought, flood, wind, or insect damage in the province, I shall without fail process the annual payment of 120 kan of coins.

Article 3: Regarding annual tribute, as supplementary payment, I must process it before the estate house collection (half by mid-eighth month, half by mid-tenth month). If processing is delayed, there will be strict reminders.

Article 4: I shall deliver lacquer (5 shō 2 gō by estate measure) and paper (10 bundles, 5 quires) according to precedent.

Article 5: Regarding this deputy administrator position, since it has been entrusted by that party, even if there should be apologies from Tajibu's side, I must not make contracts through private arrangements.

Article 6: Of this year's 120 kan, half shall be processed by the coming eleventh month.

Article 7: The remaining half of this year's amount shall be processed by the twentieth day of the coming twelfth month.

Article 8: Regarding advance payments made to Tajibu's side from this year's public duties, I shall report the details and have them reduced. However, if the amount is small, no report is necessary.

I shall strictly observe these articles and never violate the terms of this pledge document. Should there be any misconduct or negligence, the deputy administrator position shall be immediately revoked, and at that time no objections may be raised.
Therefore, this pledge document is as follows.

Entoku 3rd year (Metal Boar) 10th month 28th day

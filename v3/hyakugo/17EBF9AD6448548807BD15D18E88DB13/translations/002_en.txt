We have received word that there will be a ceremonial enshrinement of sacred relics at our temple on the coming 27th day. An official letter from the court liaison has arrived once again regarding this matter. Please inform all temple officers and subordinates of this announcement. I humbly and respectfully submit this letter.

February 19th, Ryūken
To the Head Monk Hōin

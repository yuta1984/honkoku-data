The petition submitted by Toji temple administrator Raiken regarding the administrative office of Aki Province is as follows: Having reviewed the details in the petition, although orders were previously given to both messengers to halt the unlawful seizures by estate stewards (jito) and others in various villages and estates, [these orders] have not been carried out, which is extremely inappropriate. Without delay, those causing disruption in various places should be expelled, and in accordance with precedent, provincial administration should be entrusted to the temple administrator, with collection [of revenues] to be executed. This directive is transmitted by imperial command.

The repeated petition submitted by Toji temple administrator Raiken regarding the administrative office of Aki Province is as follows: Although [this province] serves as a construction fund province for our temple, the fact that estate stewards (jito) and others in various villages and estates continue to unlawfully seize [revenues] by taking advantage of chaotic times greatly invites punishment. Urgently, together with Asonuma Shimono Jiro, [officials] should proceed to those various places, expel those who are causing disruption, and in accordance with precedent, ensure that all administrative duties are carried out entirely as the temple administrator's responsibilities, with collection agents dispatched without delay. This directive is transmitted by imperial command.

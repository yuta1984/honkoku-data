　　　Respectfully donating rice fields
　　　　　　Total: One tan of Honjo Chokushi-den
　The aforementioned rice fields were donated to this temple by the nun Zōshin, but due to certain circumstances, they have been permanently donated to serve as lamp oil funds for Tōji Saiin Temple, which is indeed true and proper.
　Therefore, there shall be no interference from others. Hence, this document of permanent donation is hereby created for future reference.

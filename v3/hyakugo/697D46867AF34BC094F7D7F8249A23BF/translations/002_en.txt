Regarding the Deputy Administrator Position of Kamikatsura Ueno-no-sho Estate in Yamashiro Province, under Toji Temple

As we have been appointed to the position of deputy administrator through the benevolence of the temple, we shall not disobey the temple's commands or act with selfish negligence in any matter.

Article 1: Annual tribute rice, land taxes, straw, rice bran, laborers, etc. shall be delivered to the temple without delay at the proper times.

Article 2: When there are newly developed rice fields, we shall report to the superior envoy and receive proper inspection.

Article 3: When developing new rice fields and dry fields, we shall not conceal any land that appears as measured area, and shall properly handle the corresponding annual tribute, etc.

Article 4: Regarding annual tribute and other matters, even if one of the two persons fails in his duties, the other person shall make compensation.

Article 5: Annual tribute and official duties shall be delivered without confusion to the main storehouse. If delivery is made to private locations under the pretext of "small portions," we shall strictly receive punishment.

Article 6: Even if there are matters of tax reduction due to crop damage, we shall not act as intermediaries for any petitions from young masters or peasants.

If we violate any of these articles, our deputy administrator positions may be immediately replaced, and we shall not voice any objections at that time. If we falsely represent these intentions, we shall receive divine punishment from the Guardian Hachiman Daibosatsu, the Five Inari Shrines, Daishi Sambo, and the temple guardian deities. Therefore, we respectfully submit this pledge document as stated above.

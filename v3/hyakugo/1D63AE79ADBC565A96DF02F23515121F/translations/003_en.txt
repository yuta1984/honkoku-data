I hereby respectfully submit this request:

Regarding the various articles concerning the administrative position of Yamashiro Province Ōkōji estate, a domain of Tōji Temple

Since I have been appointed to this position through the temple's benevolence and have solemnly accepted it, I must not act with selfish freedom or negligence in any matter.

Article 1: The annual tribute money during the rainy season must be collected with diligence and submitted to the temple without missing the proper time. Moreover, when developing newly opened rice fields and farmlands created by river flooding, I must prepare them fairly without concealing even the smallest portion for later personal gain.

Article 1: Should there be any unlawful conduct or negligence, even if my position is later revoked and my residence and equivalent assets are confiscated along with the collected revenues through settlement procedures, I shall not utter a single word of objection at that time.

Regarding the above articles: even if only one matter is violated, my administrative position will be immediately revoked by official punishment, and at that time I shall not be permitted to voice any objection whatsoever.

However, should there be any intercession with various powerful families when that time comes, it must be swiftly reported to the authorities, and I must strictly accept punishment. Any violator shall suffer the divine punishment of Hachiman Daibosatsu, the guardian deity of this temple, as well as that of the Great Master (Kōbō Daishi).

Thus, this pledge document is as stated above.

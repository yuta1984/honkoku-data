1. Regarding the land holdings of this estate, whether assigned to temples and shrines or to village headmen and peasants, I will never grant them arbitrarily but must always seek proper consultation.

1. Regarding expenses for courtesies to the provincial military governor, even for a single coin, I will not forget fairness and shall not consider private interests.

1. When criminal investigations and other incidents occur locally, I will report them without delay and shall not take arbitrary actions.

1. Within the temple precincts and estate buildings, I will especially maintain peacefulness and there shall be no forceful conduct whatsoever.

Should I violate even one of the above articles, I accept that my deputy administrator position may be revoked without delay, and at that time I will raise no objections. If at such time I should rely on the intercession of powerful families or influential houses, I will be swiftly expelled from the temple grounds and will especially receive divine punishment. Should I make false statements regarding any of these articles, I, Jōzō, will surely receive divine retribution from the guardian deities of this temple: Hachiman Great Bodhisattva, the Five Great Myōjin of Inari, the Great Teacher, the Three Treasures, and the temple guardian deities. Therefore, I respectfully write this oath document.

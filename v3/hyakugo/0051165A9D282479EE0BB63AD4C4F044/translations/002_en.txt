Contract regarding the half-tax (hanzei) and deputy administrator positions of both the jitō (military steward) and ryōke (estate proprietor) of Tara-no-shō estate in Wakasa Province, which belongs to Tōji Temple

1. Regarding land tribute: For fifty years (from [year] to [year]), the temple shall collect half of the annual tax from the spring and summer harvests of the said half-tax portion and deputy administrator's portion (however, this refers to half of the temple's portion after deducting the deputy's share, the shugo's regular and extraordinary礼物gifts, unfilled amounts due to poor harvests, land taxes, corvée labor, etc.).

2. Having contracted for half of the estate's annual tax, the temple shall have no involvement whatsoever in public and private gifts and other expenses in future administrative matters.

3. Regarding the estate's land grants and administration: should public duties naturally arise in the future,献料contributions to the capital and provinces, land taxes, corvée labor, local losses, and other extraordinary levies shall be handled from the total annual tax (the total of the contracted half-tax), with the remaining annual tax divided equally between both parties for temple submission.

4. Regarding local administration: when the deputy appointed by the temple submits annual tax to the temple, annual allocations shall be requested each year, and no estate management shall be conducted (however, an envoy shall be sent annually to oversee administrative conditions and ensure fair pricing).

5. Should public duties arise locally, if there is cooperation with the temple, strategies must be devised without negligence and never be merely observed (however, this excludes public duties from the original rightful holdings).

6. Regarding the jitō and ryōke's affairs in the original rightful holdings: no objections shall be raised even over minor matters.

7. The contract term for this half-tax land grant is limited to fifty years as promised. Therefore, after fifty years it shall become the temple's complete possession, and this contract shall be returned.

The aforementioned estate, though both jitō and ryōke have completely donated the land,

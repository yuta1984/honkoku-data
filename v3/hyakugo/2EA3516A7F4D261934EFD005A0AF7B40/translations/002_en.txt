I hereby pledge and accept:

Conditions for the Administrative Position of One Side of Uematsu Manor, Yamashiro Province, Domain of Tōji Temple

1. Since I have been appointed to this administrative position through special petition, not through the regular steward position, I shall not act arbitrarily or neglectfully.

2. I shall collect the annual rice tax without delay each year and deliver it to the temple with full responsibility.

3. Regarding the development of new rice fields and dry fields through river works and land reclamation, I shall report everything openly and maintain fairness, even in small matters.

4. I shall serve as the head administrator under both deputy administrators each year.

5. All rice taxes, even small amounts, must be delivered to the main temple storehouse and shall never be delivered to private residences.

6. If I commit any unlawful acts or neglect my duties and am dismissed from my position, I shall complete the accounting for collected taxes, and when my residence and assigned fields are confiscated accordingly, I shall raise no objections at that time.

If I violate any of these conditions, even one, I shall be immediately dismissed from the administrative position as punishment, and at that time I shall raise no objections whatsoever. Furthermore, if there is any attempt to seek intervention from powerful patrons at that time, this matter shall be quickly brought to official attention and I shall firmly accept punishment. If I violate these terms, I shall suffer the divine punishment of Hachiman Daibosatsu, guardian deity of this temple, and of Daishi. Therefore, this pledge document is as stated above.

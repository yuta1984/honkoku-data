I humbly pledge the following articles:
1. Regardless of age, those who serve as retainers must not commit any acts of rudeness or injustice in any matter.
2. One must not conspire with estate managers and peasants of various manors with ulterior motives to commit slander or harm.
3. Annual tributes to the various parties including East and West Kujō should be settled through timely negotiations, and autumn advances must never be requested.
4. Expenses for Buddhist rituals and painting costs must be settled annually without fail.
5. Having received gracious forgiveness and pardon for personal wrongdoings, one must harbor no ill will toward any of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.
Should any of these articles be violated, even in the slightest, I shall be immediately dismissed from all positions and subjected to severe punishment, and shall incur the divine punishment of Daishi, Hachiman, Inari Myōjin, and all the buddhas, gods, and Three Treasures throughout Japan. Therefore, I submit this pledge document as stated.

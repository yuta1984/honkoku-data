Among these, only 13,000 to 15,000 actually hatch. The reason there are distinctions between superior and inferior silkworm eggs is precisely this - those with the highest hatching rate are considered superior grade.

Now, to raise silkworms, one constructs wooden frames with threads stretched like a net at the bottom, spreads paper within, and arranges the silkworms on top of the paper. The temperature of the room where they are raised should be maintained, in Germany with the aid of furnaces, constantly between 20 to 24 degrees Celsius, or 66 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit.

In France, the primary concern is to constantly circulate air in the room and frequently refresh it with fresh air. Without this, it is said that the silkworms may suffer damage from stuffiness.

When mulberry leaves reach a diameter of 5 to 6 bu, in Germany around mid-May in the Western calendar - that is, about ten days after the 88th night - the silkworm eggs are transferred to paper boxes. Until then, it is best to store the eggs in as cool a place as possible.

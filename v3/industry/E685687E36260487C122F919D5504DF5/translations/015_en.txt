to create an extremely thin, coarse, and transparent bag, gradually spinning out thread to form its interior. The shape is mostly oval, though rarely some are spherical. This is called a cocoon. The innermost layer is like extremely thin paper. The length of thread that a silkworm spins out is generally about 3,500 ell (approximately 1,150 jō), but the length of thread obtained through reeling is only 300 ell (90 jō) to 600 ell (180 jō). Rarely, some reach 900 ell (270 jō). This is because both the coarse outer portions and the paper-like inner quality cannot be made into good thread. The length of a cocoon is typically about 1 sun 2 bu, with a diameter of approximately 8 bu as the normal size. When broken open and examined, it has roughly the thickness of playing card paper. When the silkworm first begins making its cocoon, it is white with a slightly yellowish tint, but as the cocoon is completed, it becomes golden in color. If initially golden-colored, many eventually turn pale yellow instead. Occasionally, some produce white thread from beginning to end.

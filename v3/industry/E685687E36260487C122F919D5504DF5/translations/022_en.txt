The amount of mulberry leaves consumed by these approximately 14,000 silkworms is about 460 kin, which converts to over 122 kanme in Japanese weight measurements. When distributed across the five periods, it is approximately as follows:

First period: 2.5 kin
Second period: 7.5 kin
Third period: 23 kin
Fourth period: 67 kin
Fifth period: 360 kin
Total: 460 kin

Although the quantity of mulberry is this large, per individual silkworm it amounts to merely 8 monme in weight. The quality of mulberry leaves

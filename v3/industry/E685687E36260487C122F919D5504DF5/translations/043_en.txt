will suffer damage to such an extent that foolish incidents occur regularly.

For daily clothing and other essential items during the voyage, one should pack everything in one box, write "Cabin" on the box (meaning living quarters), and hand it to the mail ship agent. This will be placed separately in the passenger's room, allowing free opening and closing daily. If packed together with other cargo, even if any item is needed, it can never be retrieved except when arriving at various ports.

Clothing for the voyage should be tailored entirely in a clean manner without begrudging a small amount of money, and plenty of changes of clothes should be prepared. Particularly, undergarments should be prepared in quantities of at least thirty or more pieces. The reason is that as one proceeds beyond Hong Kong in China, the climate becomes extremely hot, requiring daily changes of clothes and immediate washing during one or two to three days of anchorage at ports along the way. Japanese people making their first voyage have thus far paid no attention to such matters, appearing very unseemly on board and being unable to escape the mockery of foreigners.

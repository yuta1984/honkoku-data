As they are formed by combining two strands into one, they are all flattened oval in shape. The thread has considerable tensile strength, and when pulled, it can stretch about one-sixth of its length. If pulled harder than that, it will break. A scholar named Robinet once tested the strength of various threads. When silk threads were twisted together to make a thickness equivalent to one "stripe angle" (3 rin 3 mō angle), and heavy objects were suspended to measure the force, it finally broke at 43 kin 62 (equivalent to about 11 kan 600 monme in our measurement). Generally, this force is equivalent to one-third that of high-quality iron wire, or half that of brass wire.

Raw silk bears various impurities on its outer surface. Generally, the pure silk substance constitutes fifty-four parts out of one hundred, with the remainder being all adhering matter. Unless this is dissolved and removed, it cannot produce true beautiful luster or be dyed in the brilliant colors that should be admired. Of this adhering matter, approximately nineteen to twenty parts consist of glue (nikawa).

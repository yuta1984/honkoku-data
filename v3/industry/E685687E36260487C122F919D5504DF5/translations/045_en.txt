Each person should pay the ship fare in Yokohama, and in addition should carry at least about one thousand dollars per person as funds for use upon arrival in that country. This should not be carried as actual cash, but rather should be arranged and carried as bills of exchange from money changers. Besides this, one should carry about one hundred dollars each as spending money for the journey.

The ocean passage fare for first class, per person, from Yokohama to Marseille, France is 145 pounds on British ships, plus 5 pounds for steamship fare to Italy, totaling 150 pounds (approximately 675 dollars). On French ships, first class for one person costs 3,400 francs (approximately 618 dollars). This should be paid directly to the aforementioned steamship agent, and one should receive a ticket (English) or billet (French) - an ocean passage voucher. The person should write their own name on this, keep it on their person, and on the day of boarding show it to the purser, who handles the steamship's accounts, then carefully store it away. If one does not have this, boarding will not be permitted, so one must be careful not to lose it.

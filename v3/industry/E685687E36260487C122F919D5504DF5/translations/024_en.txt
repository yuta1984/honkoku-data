Using our scales, approximately 6 kan 250 monme of cocoons are produced. The amount of silk thread obtained from these cocoons is not uniform, generally ranging between 500 monme and 625 monme. On average, the calculation is that 4 monme of thread can be obtained from 60 cocoons.

Silkworms are extremely fragile creatures, and many die of sudden illness before forming cocoons. Therefore, even with 14,000 hatchlings, no more than 12,500 will grow to maturity. Consequently, compared to the initial number of eggs, obtaining 62 cocoons from 100 eggs is considered average.

In large-scale sericulture facilities, care often cannot be adequately provided, resulting in many losses, and it often happens that only 50 cocoons can be successfully produced from 100 eggs. Conversely, with small-scale operations where adequate care can be fully provided, it is quite possible to achieve a ratio of 85 cocoons per 100 eggs. This is considered the best outcome.

In countries warmer than Germany, France, and others, silkworms

should be made of wood materials such as pine or fir, sized to fit one sheet of silkworm egg paper, with 200 to 250 sheets forming one box. The packing method should involve placing thin wooden spacers of about one bu (approximately 3mm) thickness between every five or ten sheets, and drilling several small holes around the perimeter of the box. This is to allow air circulation and prevent decay.

In previous years, there was a merchant who purchased silkworm egg paper in Yokohama and transported it to foreign countries aboard a Western ship. However, he failed to notice the need to drill holes in the box and did not insert wooden spacers, resulting in crude packing. When the lid was opened upon arrival, everything had rotted. This happened because although it was winter in Japan at the time of departure, the climate near the equator was similar to our summer, causing the silkworm eggs to hatch unexpectedly early and die from being steamed inside the box. Therefore, when going overseas, one must carefully calculate and consider the degrees of cold and heat.

The outer wrapping of the box should be made with something like Ryukyu matting. This is

Since 25 French francs equal one British pound, when arranging the aforementioned exchange, one should convert to British pounds and arrange accordingly. This is because in Asia, particularly in China and Japan, British currency is far more convenient than French currency.

For expenses during the voyage, one should carry at least about 100 dollars. From Japan to Singapore, dollars serve as the general currency. From Singapore to the Suez Canal, a silver currency called rupees (currency of British territories) is in general use, and pounds also circulate freely. Beyond Suez, French francs are primarily used.

Mexican dollars should never be carried beyond Singapore, as there are great losses in exchange. Francs should not be carried beyond Egypt - the same principle applies.

In past years, when our countrymen traveled to Europe, not being well informed about this matter, they carried regular dollars as far as Egypt and reportedly suffered a loss of 50 dollars per thousand dollars.

A foreign currency guide will be published soon and should be consulted for reference.

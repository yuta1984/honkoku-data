In that metropolis there are many wealthy merchants, so one should travel there to inquire about market prices and engage in negotiations without letting one's guard down. One should also inquire about prices in Italy and neighboring countries, and depending on timing, place advertisements in newspapers. To do this, if one requests the newspaper publishing offices in Marseilles, they will gladly publish it and it will spread to various places on the same day. The cost varies depending on the length of the text, but for something like silkworm egg cards, it would be about ten francs, and not only in that locality but immediately in various countries it becomes known, and buyers come one after another. Also, depending on circumstances, even without requesting it ourselves, when newspaper companies learn that Japanese have independently brought silkworm egg cards, they will quickly publish the news.

Generally, the recent market price for Japanese silkworm egg cards in Marseilles is twenty-five to thirty-five francs per sheet, with the highest quality being even more expensive. Averaging this out, they can be sold at a price of thirty francs per sheet (approximately five dollars).

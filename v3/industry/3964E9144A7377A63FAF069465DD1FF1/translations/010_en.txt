On Silkworm Egg Production Centers (with an addendum: The Story of Selling Cooked Rice for One Hundred Gold Coins)

During the Genbun era (1736-1741), the Kantō provinces sought silkworm eggs from the Ueda area of Shinshū (Shinano Province) and considered them to be of the highest quality. The provinces near the imperial capital (Kyoto) conducted sericulture using yellow cocoon varieties from Gōshū (Ōmi Province) and those from Kakogawa in Banshū (Harima Province). Around that time, the Yūki area in Shimousa Province produced many silkworm eggs and sold them to Ōshū (Mutsu Province) and other provinces.

Once, a great flood occurred in the Yūki area. Mountains upstream collapsed at a narrow point downstream, turning the upstream area for over three ri into something resembling a sea. Many houses and fields were severely damaged, and countless people died. Due to this disaster, the seed merchants of that region were unable to harvest silkworm eggs that year.

Therefore, they went to Date Village in Date County, Ōshū Province, and told of this great calamity. The host said, "The mulberry trees of our region are superior to those of the Yūki area. If you take seeds from our locality, you will surely produce excellent high-quality seeds." From then on, they selected and gathered cocoons from the village and nearby areas to produce seeds.

The host also said, "In Shinshū Province, because the Zenkōji Nyorai (Buddha) resides in the country, the people write 'Zenkōji Nyorai' on the inner inscriptions of seed papers to partake in this spiritual connection. Fortunately, we have a temple hall here with a miraculous Nyorai. For our province, it would be appropriate to write 'Nyorai-dō' (Buddha Hall)." They agreed this was reasonable. This was the beginning of the inner inscriptions on Ōshū seed papers. From then on, various household seals came to be written on them.

When this seed was sold and tested in various provinces, the following year's silkworms produced an excellent harvest. From this point on, Ōshū seeds became celebrated as authentic regional varieties, and now both Date and Shinobu counties, as well as other nearby areas, produce and sell seeds.

Later, another great flood occurred in the Aizu area of Ōshū Province, causing Lake Inawashiro to burst. Water flooded into the Yūki river system in Sōshū (Shimōsa Province), which had been damaged for a thousand years, and at this time it broke again catastrophically, creating indescribable chaos along that river system.

Two travelers happened to be passing downstream during this commotion. While they hesitated, wondering what this disturbance could be, water came surging from upstream, swirling like a great serpent rising up. In an instant, everything became like a vast sea, leaving them with no choice but to climb up a willow tree and pray to the buddhas and gods in a dreamlike state.

Gradually, the wind and rain grew fiercer with no sign of stopping. The two men clung to the branches, fearing they might be swept away with the tree at any moment and become mere foam at the bottom of the water. They remained in this dazed state for about two days until finally the wind and rain began to subside a little, giving them some sense of being alive again. However, since the floodwaters had not yet receded, they remained helpless.

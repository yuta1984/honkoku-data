Is it not also easy? The Record says: "Sincerity is the Way of Heaven. What proceeds from sincerity to enlightenment is called nature."

Now, each person follows their formed mind and takes it as their teacher - who indeed has no teacher? If the mind sincerely seeks it, even if not hitting the mark, it will not be far off. When the one qi moves, it becomes a solid form, and the Five Elements become its substance; things receive their nature and generate their naturalness. Humans, being the most spiritual of all things, use their intelligence to become sovereign rulers, and these rulers are the father and mother of the people. When sage-kings rule over all under Heaven, they serve this naturalness. Their establishing of proper positions, organizing the state and mapping the land, setting up offices and duties - all follow this naturalness. Their approving and appointing officials, their magnificent writings, their brilliant achievements - all follow this naturalness. The earth produces things, humans rely on things to create occupations, and through these occupations they serve the sage-king. The sage-king measures abilities and assigns duties; the four classes of people present their strength and receive tasks, so that the court has no vacant offices and the countryside has no idle people.

Therefore it is said: "The ruler's governance of subjects is through tasks. Those who have abilities have skills. Skills encompass tasks, tasks encompass righteousness, righteousness encompasses virtue, virtue encompasses the Way, and the Way encompasses Heaven."

Things inherently have form, forms inherently have names, and names should properly be called sage-like. Therefore, only after knowing not to speak of non-action can one know the principles of the Way. Though forms differ and circumstances vary, they do not differ in principle from the myriad things, and can serve as the beginning for all under Heaven. When sage-kings dwell among the people's talents, they must adapt to the different systems of Heaven and Earth's cold and warmth, moisture and dryness, broad valleys and great rivers. The people living in these places have different customs, different balances of hard and soft, light and heavy, slow and fast, different harmonies of the five flavors, different systems of tools and implements, and different appropriate clothing. They cultivate their teachings without changing local customs, regulate their governance without changing what is appropriate. The people of the five directions all have natures that do not shift. The people of the five directions all have their secure dwellings, harmonious flavors, and what is appropriate.

They held festivals and established it as the Kureha Shrine, making it clearly evident. Also, during the Wado era of Emperor Genmei, imperial edicts were issued to have silk brocade woven. Thereafter, much silk fabric was produced at the western market of Luoyang (Kyoto). Even now, it remains Kyoto's premier specialty product under the name Nishijin-ori. Chinese weaving began from the time of the Yellow Emperor, and embroidery was first begun by the empress of King Wen. According to certain writings, a man named Zhang Qian of the Han dynasty rode on a raft and reached the source of the Milky Way, where he found a divine woman weaving at a loom and a man leading an ox who conversed with her. These were the Weaver Girl and Cowherd. From this, the Han emperor began the Qiqiao Festival. In Japan, during the reign of the 46th sovereign, Empress Kōken, in the 7th year of Tenpyō-shōhō, this festival was first performed. It was primarily to pray for the achievement of women's crafts.

On the Beginning of Japanese Cotton
In ancient Japan, there was silk fabric but no cotton. People of low status put reed plumes or miscanthus plumes into cloth to ward off the cold. During the reign of the 50th sovereign, Emperor Kanmu, a person from the Kunlun country drifted ashore in Mikawa Province. This person brought cotton seeds, which were received and planted throughout the provinces. At some point these seeds were lost, but again during the Bunroku era, seeds were transmitted from foreign countries, and now they have spread widely throughout the realm, becoming a help to the people. What we now call "momen" (cotton) is cloth woven from this cotton fiber. Therefore, it should be called "momen-nuno" (cotton cloth), and the current term is perhaps an abbreviation. When referring to it by the Chinese characters' pronunciation, since the same characters become confusing, when referring to the fiber itself, we use the Japanese reading "kiwata." Also, because it is beaten soft with a cotton bow, it's also called "tōwata" (Tang cotton) or "uchiwata" (beaten cotton). That cotton garments are called "nunoko" also preserves an ancient name. The dyeing of clothing has ancient beginnings in both Japan and China. Long ago in Shinobu village in Ōshū, a person named Tamade Minesane found disordered patterns of shinobu grass on a rock face and applied them to hunting robes.

From the Kokin-shū: "In Michinoku's / Shinobu grass patterns rubbed on cloth— / For whose sake did I / Begin this confusion? / It was not of my doing." —Minister of the Left Kawara

Feeding Trial with True Wild Mulberry
One year when mulberry was insufficient, around mid-season I reluctantly fed silkworms with true wild mulberry that grew naturally mixed among other trees in mixed forests, from which branches had never been harvested annually. When mixed with field mulberry and given to them, they would not eat the wild mulberry at all. However, when left to hunger for a while and given only mountain leaves, they would eat them out of necessity. Naturally, silkworms of poor temperament would not eat them. Some people do raise silkworms from start to finish using only mountain leaves. However, silkworms raised by experts who properly regulate conditions from the larval stage onward do not mind whether the mulberry is good or bad. Of course, harvesting mulberry and preparing leaves requires much labor, so large-scale production cannot be achieved, and they do not make good silkworm eggs.

Feeding Trial with Pomegranate Leaves
Following the teaching in the Agricultural Encyclopedia that feeding pomegranate leaves produces silk suitable for koto strings with good sound resonance, I occasionally mixed young leaves with mulberry and tried feeding them, but the silkworms would not eat them at all. Perhaps they would eat them if raised on them from the beginning, but I did not test this thoroughly. Nevertheless, there are no lies in the teachings of ancient sages in both Japan and China. Strong silkworms later dislike the soft tips of mulberry buds. Pomegranate tree leaves are twice as tough as mulberry leaves. It is precisely by feeding these tough leaves that the sound quality would be good. Also, while the bulk of silk might be less, the weight yield should be greater. Imagining this, rather than soft lu mulberry, it would be good to plant seed-grown jing mulberry in fertile upland fields and feed with that.

burn it on, and when buds emerge slightly in the coming spring, leave two to three or four to five thick, flourishing ones and remove all the rest. If there are many small branches, the leaves become thin and fine, and when fed to silkworms, there is little silk. Mulberry is something that grows easily, and except during the coldest period from November, it will take root well when planted in any month. Both where seedlings are raised and where they are transplanted, they should be planted on the sunny side of hemp, Indian mallow, millet, or sorghum to provide shade. ○Also, before picking leaves to feed silkworms, sprinkle clean water before picking. After rain, this is not troublesome. ○If March 3rd is clear, mulberry will flourish well. If it rains on this day, mulberry leaf prices will be high, and cotton will also be expensive. ○Also, after mulberry has flourished for a long time, the neighboring roots become entangled, root-lifting occurs, and it stops flourishing. At that time, make the cultivation rough and cut away the bad roots that have risen above. ○Also, regarding the number of ground mulberries to plant exclusively in fields, Chinese books record the intention to plant six to seven hundred plants per tan (about 0.1 hectare). Of course, this should depend on whether the soil is fertile or barren. In general land where crops are grown in the middle, those planted appropriately along the edges and ridge sides flourish no less than those planted with mulberry alone, and the leaves also become thick. ○Also, for raising mulberry seedlings, although last year's seeds also sprout somewhat, those sown before extreme heat (within May) using current year's mulberries all grow well without exception. Take and store the mulberries in containers. Do not store them in ways that would keep them alive otherwise. The heat will particularly damage the seed stock. ○March 3rd - This passage should be elevated to the beginning of this section.

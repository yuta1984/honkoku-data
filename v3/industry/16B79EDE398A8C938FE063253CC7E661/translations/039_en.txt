...taking them is troublesome. When jing mulberry is grown from seed and planted in fertile upland fields where it thrives well, it becomes an early-maturing tree that puts forth buds early in spring. The blue-green leaves have a blackish tinge and are plump, with thick oily coating and a glossy appearance. They feel firm to the touch and do not bear much fruit, making them excellent for silkworm feeding. When silkworms grow fat, they prefer only the firm parts of leaves, and when fed with these, the silkworms become increasingly plump, producing strong silk with high weight yield. Those that thrive in fertile upland fields are not inferior to, and may even surpass, lu mulberry. To compare these to vegetables, lu mulberry is like daikon radish, while jing mulberry would be like burdock root.

Sunny Properties Have Merit for Jing Mulberry
In the previous volume, I said that one should devise ways for silkworms to hatch when mulberry buds extend to three or four leaves in the fields, but here is another secret. Mountain-facing sunny residences warm up early, and summer heat also comes early and is particularly intense. Therefore, late silkworms suffer the worry of being damaged by subsequent heat. In such households, one should cultivate and raise good early-maturing jing mulberry around the property grounds—mountains, slopes, embankments, and even extending to the fields. These excel at putting forth young buds early, thriving early, and their leaves also become firm early, making them excellent for feeding. In households where late-hatching silkworms often fail due to excessive warmth, one should cultivate only early mulberry, making it the first priority to hatch them early and raise them quickly. If done this way, it will not greatly interfere with agricultural work and will be an extremely good strategy.

This is to prevent many insects from climbing on and the straw from becoming damp and crushed due to urine. When inverting, it should be done evenly without irregularity. If there are variations in height, the silkworms will fall toward the lower side and stick to the rear end of other silkworms, damaging the cocoons. To avoid such variations, lower them evenly around the circumference. These standing frames should be prepared during winter and spring, and when large-scale silkworms are about to climb up, this quick technique can be accomplished in a short time, which is most important and beneficial for the silkworms. Also, there are fewer clustered cocoons. The cocoons are firm, lustrous, and have strong silk - truly excellent. With both platform frames and shelf frames, when many insects enter, they crawl up onto the finished cocoons afterward and urinate on them, creating stained cocoons. They also create clustered cocoons, called "ball cocoons." Both stained and ball cocoons cannot be used for top-grade silk thread. Silkworms climb up to the frames and

crawl to their desired locations, rest briefly, defecate, and also urinate abundantly.

Straw attached to the outside and circumference is seven to eight sun from the base compared to the inner bundle
For inner bundles, long straw is arranged in steps of about seven to eight sun from the base

○ Even if one does not possess mulberry trees, if one wishes to raise many silkworms from the following year, sow seeds in May to let them grow, and afterward, during summer and autumn, frequently apply liquid fertilizer made from sardine pressed cake or dried cake boiled in water. Night soil has salt content and causes withering damage, but when thick night soil is properly applied around the roots in winter, when young buds emerge early the following spring, gradually harvest them from one end to feed silkworms. When the second growth appears in those spots, judge good and bad by the leaf shape, mark them, and in the following spring gradually thin them out to use as seedlings for transplanting.

Let one thick young shoot of that year grow straight up, remove the rest, and in early spring of the second year, break it off about one foot high from the ground. Direct the good young shoots of that year in three directions, leaving three shoots in a three-way fork, and remove the lower buds. In early spring of the third year, break off all three shoots at appropriate heights at the tips of the three-way fork. That year, many branches will emerge from the three shoots - keep the upper three branches and remove the lower branches. This creates three shoots at the end of each of the three main branches, totaling nine shoots (3×3=9). From the spring of the fourth year onward, cut and harvest from the tips of these nine shoots at heights within people's reach to feed silkworms. This is the method for cultivation on hillside fields. The crown becomes nine shoots. This is called "morning glory cultivation." The root is one but the crown becomes nine shoots.

○ Also, if planting superior seedlings with abundant築手fertilizer in fertile fields as mentioned before, plant them broken off in the soil in spring. Break

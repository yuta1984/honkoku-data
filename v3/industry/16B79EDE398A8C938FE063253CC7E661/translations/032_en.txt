only, quickly decomposing fertilizer should be buried in the soil. Since there is no other nourishment, inevitably for one year it will send out many fibrous roots to the nearby fertilizer and will not extend roots far. With more fibrous roots than the sapling's size would suggest, it grips the soil and when transplanted, flourishes unexpectedly quickly and becomes useful. Also, when planting stock trees, if too much fresh grass clippings and debris are placed near the roots and they generate strong heat, they may conversely cause withering and damage instead of fertilizing - this should be understood. ○ Also, for sowing seeds, poor soil is good.

On Sowing Mulberry Seeds
It is good to sow the stored mulberries within the fifth month. Do as Teacher Miyazaki instructed. ○ In fields similar to those for layering, stable manure, fallen leaves, dried grass, straw,

and similar materials should be finely chopped, sprinkled with liquid fertilizer, piled up and trampled down, allowed to generate heat in various ways and mature. When it develops a rotting smell and is fully decomposed, turn it over. At this stage, also finely powder dried sardines or oil cake and mix in ashes as well. Space this mixture about two feet apart in the field, stretch ropes, dig deep furrows, and put it in like making eggplant and watermelon, creating bedding fertilizer. However {{this is called "built-up fertilizer"}} lightly trample it down, cover with soil about the length of a thumb, and sow the mulberries on top. The procedure for care was detailed earlier. ○ Now, what was sown in twenty tsubo of land in the first year should be dug up the following spring around the equinox with a sharp hoe, pulled out like digging up taro, and with hand shears the long fibrous roots

At this stage, the saplings grow to eight or nine feet in height without branches, extending as sucker shoots. Also, the cut saplings should be quickly laid horizontally and covered with soil so their fibrous roots do not dry out. ○ This year, from where four to five inches were left attached to the stock tree, after the equinox of that year, five to seven young shoots will emerge from each cut point. When thin ones appear, thin them out and discard them; for the vigorous ones, bury and tend them as described earlier. ○ Without resting years, the number of saplings taken increases twofold each year, and accordingly the circular area around the stock tree also enlarges, so that each year up to one hundred good saplings can be taken from a single stock tree. With this understanding, the stock trees should also be planted with wide spacing. However {{Note: These saplings should not be planted in hard stony riverbeds. The saplings are too vigorous and difficult to plant, and they root poorly and tend to die}} ○ Also, for sapling beds, fields with poor, thin soil that are deep work best, as do seed-

sowing areas. Also, be aware that in waterlogged areas, young shoots may suffer from water rot. Since mulberry roots naturally grow few in number, thin and long, and extend far, if saplings are taken from fertile ground, they flourish well and the saplings look good, but when dug up, they have only thick, soft, long taproots with no fibrous roots. Having no choice, when the long roots are cut and transplanted, many are damaged and die. It is strange that while even cuttings can take root and live, trees with even a few roots should die. In general, there is logic in the principle that all things will grow well when moved from poor soil to fertile soil. Therefore, the ground for raising saplings should be in poor soil, and near the roots

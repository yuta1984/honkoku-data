Particularly for silkworm feeding, they grow rapidly and fatten well, producing large cocoons with many silk threads. For obtaining silkworm eggs, it is limited to silkworms that have eaten mulberry from sandy soil along large rivers, as seen in various writings, which is quite reasonable. Every province has many areas along rivers. There should be flood-prone cultivated land outside the main rice fields. On this land, farmers would also plant crops if they had surplus labor, seeds, and fertilizer beyond their main fields, but due to annual floods, barely one or two abundant harvests out of ten years are uncertain. Sometimes drought causes poor harvests, winter crops are blown down by wind, and summer crops suffer from flooding. If mulberry is planted in these fields to also serve as river barriers, they can all be harvested around mid-May, eliminating concerns about flood damage. Floods occur mostly in autumn rather than during extreme heat, so onto the tree stumps after harvesting,

various debris flows and accumulates. Though this may somewhat hinder next year's mulberry buds, it settles in the tree shade and becomes muddy, while the field's topsoil flows away. Therefore, planting in flood-damaged areas benefits mulberry. This should be kept in mind when planting. Planting trees far apart allows leaves to flourish well, and cultivating between them may provide dual benefits in some years. However, when flooding occurs, bamboo and wood flow against the mulberry trees, knocking them down, the water force becomes strong, washing away all the topsoil, and even the mulberry trees are uprooted and swept away, leaving behind a rocky riverbed and permanently damaged land. Moreover, with previous river erosion, when sediment accumulates slightly and hoeing is done, the fundamental difficulty of immediately washing and overturning leads to continuous impoverishment. Villages like this should plant mulberry.

Dig up to a depth of over one foot, bend the young shoots from where they attach to the stock tree toward the bottom of the hole without concern for slight damage, and around the middle of the shoot, gently split the bark two or three inches along the natural grain using the thumbnail to create wounds, then lightly press this into the bottom of the hole. Handle the shoot tips with great care, lean them against the excavated soil on the sides, and fill the hole completely with cut grass or weeds pulled from the field—anything that can serve as fertilizer but is difficult to keep alive. On top of this, scrape up the excavated soil and surrounding earth with a hoe, carefully add it without touching the shoot tips, and tamp down firmly. During the summer months, frequently remove any shoots and weeds that emerge from behind the stock tree within the circular area. If left as they are,

the vital energy will not flow to the saplings. This is particularly important until roots emerge on the young shoots. After roots develop, the buried grass will rot and become fertilizer and soil, the fibrous roots will take hold and form a root ball, so liquid manure is poor fertilizer for cuttings. Note: {{Fertilizer for seed sowing should also be done in this manner}} After keeping them alive in May, early in the spring after the equinox of the following year, carefully scrape away the soil by hand around where they attach to the stock tree. In the first year, leave four to five inches attached to the stock tree side, and using an extremely sharp hatchet, cut decisively in one stroke per sapling, angling the cut downward and outward with a practiced hand. Never entrust this task to someone who would hack at a single sapling two or three times. This damages the stock tree and causes the sapling end to split and be ruined. Note: {{Wounding young shoots is to make them produce many roots quickly. Even when making cuttings, if you sharpen the base and insert it deeply, roots will emerge from between the bark and wood}}

should be done. Cocoon picking should begin from the platforms, which is convenient for drying cocoons.
Fresh cocoons should not be left in containers even for a moment, as they will immediately become steamed and damaged. If rainy weather continues and maggots begin to emerge, pile them thickly on platforms, stack them on both sides, light plenty of charcoal fires in the center, place a trivet and put a large pot with hot water on it, then wrap the top and four sides with paper or mat-like materials to steam them. The fire heat and steam mix together, and without burning or getting wet, the insects inside are killed. The silk stands well with no problems. However (Note: when silk comes out well, it is said that the "standing is good"). For small-batch processing to kill them, place a bottomless large box on the earthen floor, dig a hole in the earthen floor under one side like the opening of a brazier to fan air in, plaster the inside of the box with mud, and place a trivet in the center.

Place it there, put hot water in a flat pot on top, and steam using steaming baskets that hold one to of cocoons, stacking them up. The steaming timing is determined by wrapping maggots in paper, placing them in the upper steaming basket, and after a while, taking them out to check. When they die and turn white, that is the proper timing for removing the cocoons. The water inside decreases constantly, so hot water must be added frequently. Add charcoal, add hot water, and fan from outside with a fan. Steamed cocoons should be gently spread on platforms and quickly exposed to air. If it's clear weather, quickly dry them in the sun. Five to six koku of cocoons can be steamed per day. Also, fresh cocoons of good quality are difficult to dry unless dried for three days under the blazing sun.

The standing frames should be set up as shown in the diagram, arranged in rows across the entire room from the crossing edges. The central pole should be positioned among the silkworms, with the base of the straw supported against the back wall. When the cocoons are completed after six to seven days, they should be brought out into the sunlight and harvested immediately. If there is insufficient help available, they can be hung under eaves or on poles for one or two days, but care should be taken to prevent them from becoming stuffy.

Next, the floor remnants of the previous room should be rolled up with the bedding materials and cleaned, dry straw mats should be laid as replacement, and the fourth-molting silkworms should be spread out. This is called the "second seating." For small households to harvest many cocoons, it is impossible without this second seating. This method should be planned and prepared from the time of first taking out the silkworm eggs. Even with silkworms born four to five days late,

depending on the rearing location and the careful management of mulberry feeding thickness, there can be a ten-day delay. However, if there is about a ten-day interval between early and late hatching, and there isn't an interval of about fourteen to fifteen days until the fourth molting during rearing, it won't serve as a second seating. However, [marginal note: After the fourth molting, approximately seven days of mulberry feeding, followed by continuous frame climbing until cocoon completion takes seven days] Besides the above, platforms and adjustable shelves can also be used as second seatings depending on the circumstances.

For the silkworm second floor, bamboo slat flooring works well. However, if it sways and moves constantly, it is bad - the silkworms become startled, eat mulberry poorly, and the rearing period extends. Additionally, in corners of rooms or at entrances to second floors where there is heavy foot traffic, the silkworms naturally become startled, eat mulberry poorly, fall behind, and don't climb up uniformly. Lower shelves also develop feeding delays and don't climb up simultaneously with upper shelves.

For materials used in frames: bundled brushwood branches, river bush clover, mountain bush clover, deutzia, wheat chaff, and pine needles are also used. Various materials should be used according to each person's methods. The usage methods also vary among individuals.

There is nothing superior to farmers engaging in sericulture according to their circumstances. When mulberry planting serves as flood control, it also helps with the maintenance of embankments surrounding the main rice fields, naturally providing benefits to the lord. Moreover, when farm households become prosperous and the population increases, it strengthens the domain. While planting large trees outside the embankments is prohibited by law, mulberry trees are not grown as tall trees and are treated the same as millet and barnyard grass crops. Like willows, mulberry trees root well through layering and cutting propagation. Even when deeply buried by flooding, they quickly sprout roots directly from the tips of small branches, and old trees rejuvenate into young trees, which is beneficial.

There are also many varieties of willows. Grass willows prefer waterside areas well, and while books state that mulberry trees favor riverside locations, their root systems differ greatly from willows. During droughts when they seek water, they extend roots deep and spread fine roots far and wide, surpassing other trees in this ability. When they dislike water, they produce roots upward from the trunk, being completely adaptable. Therefore, books state they thrive easily when planted along riverbanks. These are excellent for feeding silkworms. In every province, riverbanks suffer from burial, erosion, and washing away, but when even a little sand is gathered and maintained, the trees do not die. Soon grass grows underneath, and when flooding occurs again, soil will accumulate using the grass as anchor points. Being such excellent trees, through seed sowing, tens of thousands of seedlings can be easily produced within two to three years. Therefore, many should be cultivated along riverbanks regardless of whether they are large or small rivers, in shallow sandy soil mixed with stones.

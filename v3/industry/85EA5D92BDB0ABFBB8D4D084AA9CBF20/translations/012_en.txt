The silkworms climb on top of each other and eat the mulberry leaves, so the weak silkworms pressed underneath cannot eat the mulberry leaves.
While sitting still and waiting for the silkworms above to move elsewhere, with their heads hanging down, the silkworms on top eat their fill of mulberry leaves while those pressed below cannot eat. When the silkworms above finally move elsewhere, the silkworms below search for mulberry but the ones that were on top have already eaten everything up, leaving only dried husks, and all the remaining leaves have withered. While this back and forth continues, time passes and the weak silkworms suffer from hunger. This is the fundamental cause of irregularity and poor quality, which will cause difficulties later on. This is an extremely important secret teaching. One must understand this very well.

○Upon reflection, while it is not entirely untrue that the silkworm business has good and bad fortune depending on one's luck, ultimately it comes down to the quality of the seed and the skill or clumsiness of the rearing methods. Also, while there are differences in abundance or scarcity due to yearly cycles and climate, there will be superiority and inferiority based on rearing methods. For example, the way of farming is the same - in abundant years, both those with good luck and bad luck achieve good harvests, and in poor years all uniformly have bad harvests, but even then there are differences in the amount of yield depending on the care taken. Therefore,

Heaven shows no favoritism at all, and the differences in human effort are evident. People who do not understand this principle
will randomly pray to Buddhist deities and gods, resent seed suppliers for no reason, count their neighbor's treasures, and envy and complain about others. While Buddhist deities and gods provide protection according to people's wishes, if one's own rearing methods are neglectful, what can be done? If one asks experienced people many times and does not neglect proper rearing methods, it is clear that even in a year of universal poor harvest, one should be able to achieve a reasonable harvest.

　　A Case of Annual Silkworm Failure Due to Misunderstanding
In a certain country, knowing that sericulture was profitable, the local lord had the farmers in his domain grow mulberry trees and raise silkworms. However, being unfamiliar with this practice, they obtained a manual from the eastern provinces and followed that book's methods for sericulture, but continued to have poor harvests for seven or eight years, suffering enormous losses. The people of the country became greatly exhausted and concluded that this land must surely be unsuitable for silkworms, and eventually cut down the mulberry trees as well. A traveler came by and asked about the reason, and the local people said: "In recent years, ordered by our lord, we have been raising silkworms..."

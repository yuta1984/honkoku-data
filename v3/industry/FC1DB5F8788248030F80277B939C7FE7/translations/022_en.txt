should not be traded. However, until now people have been confused about rearing and
do not know the reliable principles, so it is difficult to distinguish between superior and inferior eggs when raising them.
When the weather is unfavorable, they begin raising without distinction, so
even when seeking poor eggs, they do not realize it, wondering only whether it is due to weather differences, their own mistakes,
or whether the eggs are bad - many people cannot tell which. Now, if
rearing is done correctly in this manner, one can discern the quality of eggs even slightly, and should be able to distinguish immediately.
If one fails with silkworms due to one's own mistakes,
one should record those circumstances in detail and
raise them with that knowledge the following year. However, there are also things that those seeking eggs should be cautious about.

First and foremost, when seeking eggs, one should also pay sufficient attention
and prepare properly. One should not treat the egg source carelessly. In many cases,
depending on the location, there are people who take pride in carelessly
cutting prices low, but this will result in great loss. Just as can be seen in reality,
in places with poor intentions, they seek inferior eggs year after year,
the silkworms perform miserably and the village character becomes poor. On the other hand, hearing about good
locations and thinking "I shall surpass others" and "others shall not be inferior to me," they provide
superior eggs with competitive spirit, therefore
the silkworms prosper year after year and become wealthy.

the heat does not subside, and from around the fourth hour of night (10 PM) until the ninth hour (10 AM) it is cool. Also, from the ninth hour until dawn, since many people close their doors completely, the heat naturally accumulates like water collecting in a well, and the silkworms can be harmed immediately. Those who are thus mindful should give mulberry leaves once at the eighth hour of night (around 8 PM). When not being mindful, one should thickly layer mulberry leaves at the fourth hour of evening (around 10 PM). The cool period should be from around the sixth hour of morning (6 AM) until the fourth hour (10 PM). However, during the shishi-take period, there is heat from evening onwards, which is concerning.

At this time, open the south high windows, and when that passes and it becomes funa-oki, open the north high windows. From niwa-oki onwards, open all the high windows completely and rest. Also, during the day, keep the northwest open. Even so, when the sunlight is strong, sprinkle water in the garden, and regardless of northwest direction, extend reed mats or similar at those openings and keep the doors open. Particularly in the third and fourth months, the penetration of sunlight is the same for both north and south. However, the northwest has good ventilation. For the south side especially, one should pay even more attention. There is also faint reflected light from the shoji screens, and silkworms placed near the southern edge will be harmed.

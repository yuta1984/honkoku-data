Place the silkworms from one sheet of eggs in a basket about three shaku wide and four shaku long.

Spread rice chaff inside the basket, then scatter the silkworms thinly from end to end so that they don't touch each other, smooth out any clusters, and sprinkle mulberry seeds again. From the next day, cut the silkworms' rear ends once daily, and thereafter give mulberry seeds five times day and night.

Even if you have old mulberry seeds available, you must not give them five times. The silkworms grow by absorbing moisture from the mulberry seeds. Generally, giving them about once a day is enough to sustain life. For example, if a newborn baby lacks sufficient milk, its growth will be precarious. The same principle applies to young silkworms.

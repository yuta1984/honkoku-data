There was nothing to be done, so he left it as it was. However, the following March,
at a place far downstream where earth had accumulated and settled, he found them
caught in the debris trap under that bridge. When he picked it up and examined it, it was silkworm eggs. Since
it had already been a hundred days, the paper had rotted completely, leaving only the form of the eggs.
Thinking to try it as an experiment, he proceeded with hatching and found
that during the four resting periods, they did not float up at all, their mulberry
consumption progressed well, they grew steadily, and later the silkworms became
exceptionally large, with no other silkworms comparable when compared. Therefore,
there is no need to worry about leaving them in water for a long time.

Chapter 9: About How to Store Silkworm Eggs

bundle the top, put them in paper bags, stand them inside boxes,
wrap in persimmon paper, and in mid-January place them on the cold north side
of the storehouse, being careful twenty days before the eighty-eighth night. However,
in years when it is warm from midwinter through the first and second months and vegetation buds early,
one should bring them out late. But in such years, one must not be careless.

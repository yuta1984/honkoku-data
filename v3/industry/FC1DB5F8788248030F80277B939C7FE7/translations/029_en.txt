In any case, silkworms should be placed thinly from the initial raising and care should be taken so they are never separated from mulberry leaves. Generally, silkworms are the same as tending other crops. For example, when growing millet or barnyard grass, those thinned when young produce large ears with good grain yield. Those grown thickly produce small ears with poor grain yield. In this way, there is naturally a reason why cocoons should also vary in size. However, before the larval stage, careful tending without leaving the silkworms' side is essential. Additionally, during the pre-larval period, mulberry seeds

are given repeatedly. When silkworm droppings pile up high, they must be replaced without fail. Specifically, on the fourth day from the initial raising, replace the droppings of medium-stage larvae, and afterwards also replace the droppings of silkworms about to molt. However, for the technique of quickly replacing silkworm droppings, when it appears they will molt the next day, before this morning's morning mulberry feeding, sprinkle rice bran thinly over the silkworms, place mulberry about three layers thick on top, and when carrying the basket and sweeping with a feather, it can be removed completely without any remainder - this works well. Also when the silkworm bed becomes moldy, quickly sprinkle bran and add mulberry. Originally, close the doors completely and use a brazier

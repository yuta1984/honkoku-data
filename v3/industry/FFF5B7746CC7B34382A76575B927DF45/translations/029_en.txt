Because they have stopped and remained inactive, and because they have become somewhat dried out, all four mulberry feedings should necessarily be done with care in this manner.

During the ship stage, follow the previous instructions. Temperature control is crucial. Since this is when silkworms multiply most vigorously, use nets when they wake up, and especially when the weather becomes warm, quickly separate the half-awakened silkworms with nets and feed them mulberry as soon as possible. The silkworms will not be damaged by heat at all, and both the slow and fast developers will align well - this is remarkable. However {{Side note: Use rice bran each time you use nets. Later on, coarse bran is sufficient}}

Poem: Ship rest - ward off wind and dampness, press with mulberry feeding; in hot weather don't light fires, remove doors and screens

From the ship-stage molting onward, silkworms multiply daily and eat much more mulberry. Therefore, observe cloud movements to predict clear or rainy weather early. When you foresee rain, prepare enough mulberry for tomorrow's feeding today. If there is empty space in storehouses or storage areas where wind cannot reach, untie the rope binding mulberry bundles and stand them upright, storing large quantities so the mulberry leaves don't develop heat - this is the skill of expert silkworm raisers. No matter how many workers you have and how thoroughly you attend to their care, if you become distracted and don't pay attention to weather patterns, and when rain continues all day, wet mulberry is harmful. If you're unprepared during the silkworms' peak eating period, many workers will spend the day idle, the silkworms will be damaged, and a moment's negligence will become the foundation of great disaster. Therefore, the silkworm mother's primary duty is to observe the thermometer and cloud movements. This must be understood. Moreover, on cold rainy days, reduce feeding to half the usual amount

The method of using rice bran is as described above. Hemp or raw silk threads may also be used. The manufacturing method will be recorded in detail in the later volume.

○For the initial feeding of mulberry leaves, they should be freshly chopped fine and frequently sprinkled through a mesh of one bu square. For later feedings, there is no need to chop separately, as the silkworms develop at different rates in stages, so using the fine particles separated by sieving was described in detail earlier.

○Silkworms should be raised coolly from the beginning so they do not succumb to cold. In hot years, there are many crop failures. Even in good harvests, the cocoon weight is light - about one kan per to of fresh cocoons. In cool years, though the days may be extended, the weight is heavy - about one kan and one hundred me. This depends greatly on the size of the cocoons. Small cocoons from good harvests can weigh about one kan and three hundred me, so cooler conditions are always better. Houses backed by mountains to the north often have poor harvests. Houses with mountains to the south and groves of trees to the west with good ventilation have good harvests. For houses in sunny mountain valleys, one should refer to thermometers and devise ways to keep things simply cool.

Record of Silkworm Raising Experiments
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　By Mr. Sekiyama
　　　On Thermometers　Note: {{Foreign-made ones are high quality and expensive though easy to read, so only privately made ones are recorded here}}

During the Kyōwa era, a resident of Kuragaki Village in Yabu District, Tajima Province, named Kamigaki Ihei Morikuni, compiled three volumes titled "Secret Record of Silkworm Raising," teaching people about the enormous benefits of sericulture. Through his own countless hardships over many years of experimentation, and having thoroughly studied silkworm raising manuals to master the techniques and become skilled in the practice, he perfected the way of sericulture with no negligence in raising methods. However, he taught that controlling the temperature inside the house was most essential. While Morikuni's personal guidance was exceptional, the temperature inside houses differs greatly from outside. Moreover, depending on the size of the building and each person's activities...

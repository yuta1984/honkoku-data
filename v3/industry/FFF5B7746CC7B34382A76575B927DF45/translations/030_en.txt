At this time, hang wet mulberry branches with large branches and all on ropes to dry, or light plenty of charcoal fires and stretch three or four poles across the top, arrange the branch mulberry on them, and without any negligence, constantly turn them over and replace them - when drying this way, large quantities of mulberry will dry in a short time. For this drying method, replace them quickly while still somewhat fresh. Do not let them sit too long and damage the mulberry.

Long ago, from the time of silkworm hatching until the hawk molting period, the weather was unfavorable with daily cold winds, and occasionally snow and hail fell, causing more than half the silkworms in various provinces to die.

An example of surviving prolonged rain during the silkworms' peak period
One year, from the ship stage of silkworms until the garden stage, heavy rain fell continuously every day, and particularly cold winds were severe, greatly damaging silkworms throughout the provinces. At that time, there was a silkworm cultivation expert in a certain village who lit fires in about three places in his house, circulated warm air appropriately where the silkworms were located, and raised them with countless variations and adaptations. They were not damaged by the rain and dampness, and he achieved the best harvest in that village. Later, this method...

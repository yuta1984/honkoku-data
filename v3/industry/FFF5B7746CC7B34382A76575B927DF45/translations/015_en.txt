Things that are poisonous and taboo for silkworms: Morning fog and deep fog must not be allowed into the silkworm room. They are poisonous.
First: tobacco and similar substances. Mulberry leaves with sparrow droppings. The scent of Japanese pepper. Oil residue. Salt residue. Mulberry trees near lacquer trees, walnut trees, or cedar trees. Mulberry with cattle or horse droppings. Grilling eels.
Generally, do not burn anything with a foul odor. If someone passes by the gate carrying fish meat or excrement with a bad smell, quickly close the doors. Also, silkworms may contract a disease called "jōmake" and turn red, or half their body may turn red, or they may suddenly shrink and die. It is said to be good to quickly burn peach leaves and fumigate them. In the Kōshū region, they also gather leaves of "kokusagi" and rub them out, sprinkling a little on mulberry leaves for the silkworms to eat. There are also countries where premium sake is sprinkled on mulberry leaves for feeding, as recorded in the "Yōsan Hiroku" (Secret Records of Sericulture). When ginseng decoction is sprinkled and fed, it is good for various symptoms and significantly increases vitality. It is also said that when the silkworms are young black larvae, insects about two bu long and one bu wide appear

and suck the silkworms to death (these are called wing insects or black insects). When many of these insects appear, put river fish or sea fish fins in straw bundles and hang them in high places near the silkworms. Those black insects will gather around the smelly odor and swarm on the bundles. At that time, quietly take the bundles to distant fields, brush off the insects, and hang them back in their original places, repeating this many times. Originally, these insects are few in cold years and many in warm years. They multiply when there is negligence in handling silkworm waste. Every year before the silkworms emerge, the house should be thoroughly cleaned. These insects seem to arise from dust under the verandas, as stated in sericulture books.

People carrying scented pouches should not approach the silkworms. If musk, camphor, frankincense, or chili peppers are burned, the silkworms will immediately spit blue foam and die. The sounds of drums, conch shells, and bells are highly poisonous. In places with slatted floors, wooden floors, or where people step heavily, the silkworms eat mulberry poorly and their development is delayed.

into another container and spread them out as mentioned before. If you raise them like this for five or six days, the silkworms will appear white and plump. However, from when the silkworms are born until before the lion's dormancy period, replace the silkworm bedding every other day.

1. When the silkworms wake up from the lion's dormancy, cut mulberry leaves somewhat large and sprinkle them over lightly. After leaving them for a while, when the silkworms have attached to the mulberry, pick them up with chopsticks into another container. Three days later, replace the silkworm bedding. This is called "medium silkworm bedding." Replace the silkworm bedding again after two more days.

Generally, the next day they will enter the hawk's dormancy. For all four dormancy periods, on the day before you think they will begin dormancy the next day, you must definitely replace the silkworm bedding.

1. When they wake up from the hawk's dormancy, apply cut mulberry as before and pick them up into another container. From then on, raise them according to the previous instructions.

1. When they wake up from the boat's dormancy, do as before - replace the silkworm bedding, feed them cut mulberry once or twice, and after that raise them with branch mulberry. However, from this time on, depending on the weather, it is acceptable to open windows in high places slightly.

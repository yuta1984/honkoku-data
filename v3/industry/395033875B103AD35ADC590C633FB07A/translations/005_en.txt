1. About ten days before the eighty-eighth night of the third month, take out the silkworm eggs, wrap one sheet of eggs loosely with about three sheets of miyamoto paper, and hang them in a slightly warm place where heat reaches, such as a tea room or second floor. Since silkworms are shade-loving insects, they should not be placed even slightly in places where sunlight shines. Throughout the entire process, never warm them with sunlight, even temporarily.
　　　　Regarding the Method of Sweeping Down Silkworms
1. After the eighty-eighth night passes and the eggs begin to show a bluish tint, wrap the eggs in cotton batting, place them loosely in a basket or willow container, hang them in a place as described above, and open them once or twice daily to let in fresh air. Then, when the silkworms emerge, during the day when the weather is most favorable, in a place with no wind at all, open the wrapping paper, sprinkle an appropriate amount of chopped mulberry or elaeagnus that has been rubbed, and leave it for a while. When the silkworms have attached to the leaves, sweep off with a feather the silkworms that have gone around to the back of the seed paper. Then immediately lay the wrapping paper directly on top of rice bran in a container, hold both ends of the seed paper, and gently tap it down from the back with chopsticks. This is the hatching process.

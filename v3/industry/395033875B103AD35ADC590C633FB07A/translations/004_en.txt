　　　　Regarding the Handling of Silkworm Eggs
1. During the hot season, silkworm eggs should be hung in a cool place, and then stored in a place where nothing will touch them. When the cold season arrives, for about three days, once a day during the daytime, briefly place them in water for a while, then pull them up in the evening and expose them to the cold wind. From then until around the spring equinox in the second month, hang them in the living room and dry them, then store them as described above.

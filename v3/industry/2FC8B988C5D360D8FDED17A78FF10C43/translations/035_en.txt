without being affected, which is good. Generally speaking, the "sleeping" of silkworms means they are in distress. Their "awakening" means they are recovering. "Mulberry application" means taking food or gaining strength. Therefore, dividing them on the third day after mulberry application - in this way, those recovering from illness have no energy, so if you handle them during this time, they will become diseased silkworms. Thus, the established method is to divide them three days after mulberry application. The remainder becomes well

Becoming thick means the silkworm droppings pile up high. When they become garden silkworms, they primarily dislike heat, so as mentioned above, the most important principle is to keep the remainder thin. During this period, much mulberry is applied, so the remainder tends to become particularly high.

Additionally, from the mulberry application of the garden awakening onward, more mulberry is applied day by day, so within one day, it should be applied three times: morning, noon, and evening.

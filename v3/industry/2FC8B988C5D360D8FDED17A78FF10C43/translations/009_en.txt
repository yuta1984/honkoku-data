△When lighting a fire in the hearth, choose firewood that produces thin smoke with no odor. Never burn green wood, as it produces much smoke. If the silkworm house has back boards, open smoke vents above the hearth, attach doors that can be opened and closed freely. If smoke gets trapped in the silkworm house, it will harm the silkworms. During the night, use charcoal fire and set up the back board doors to prevent mouse damage. In warm countries, silkworms can be raised without using fire. In cold countries, it is difficult to provide sufficient warmth without using fire. However, if hungry silkworms inhale the fire's fumes, they will inevitably develop diseases. Ensure there is mulberry among the straw so that they do not become hungry.

△Until the silkworms' second molting, old straw mats are preferable. New ones retain warmth in the straw and generate mold, which harms the silkworms. Use old straw mats that have been thoroughly dried in the sun. If mold develops before the silkworms reach maturity, quickly remove the bottom layer and transfer them to different straw mats. The embers should be dry and powdery. If they become moist and clump together, they will inevitably produce mold.

△From the day after paper removal, apply mulberry four times per day. Generally, from the beginning of hakitate (initial transfer)...

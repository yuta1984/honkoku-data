Open the doors and shoji screens, and place them in a location where mice cannot reach, exposing them to wind for seven to eight days. The silkworm eggs will turn white and become moist, and among them there should be three or four hatched silkworms. At that time, as before, wrap the silkworm eggs in four-sheet square paper, wrapping them lightly enough to keep them clean. Then light a charcoal fire in the furnace of the silkworm room, and either place them on a shelf near the fire, or construct a high shelf above the furnace, avoiding direct heat, and place the silkworm eggs wrapped in fresh straw bundles on the side.

Place them there from around the eighth hour of the day (2 PM), maintaining charcoal fire continuously day and night.

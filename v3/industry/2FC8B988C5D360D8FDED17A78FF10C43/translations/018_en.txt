Records of Domestic Sericulture and Mulberry Cultivation
　　　Preface
　This small booklet aims to supplement the inadequacies of my father's intentions and 
　to inform sericulture farming households of the great benefits available each year.
　Therefore, it is based on simple conversations in common language,
　and deliberately uses unadorned speech, such as calling "yō" 
　"nushi," and "nezumi" "yakaze," which are ancient
　local dialects (tokorokotoba) of that region.

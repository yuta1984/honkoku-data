Sweep away with feathers, wrap in clean paper, place in new cotton padding, cover that, make a lid with straw, place on the shelves of the silkworm house, and light a fire to warm it. The next day, open and examine at the hour of the Snake (9-11 AM). Roughly more than half the silkworms should have emerged. Immediately perform the "hakitate" (initial transfer). The hakitate should be done with utmost care and attention as the first priority. That morning, pick the soft heart leaves of mulberry, cut them extremely finely, and place them over the seeds where silkworms have emerged. The silkworms should smell the fragrance and climb onto the leaves. Using bird feathers, gently sweep them down onto paper together with the mulberry, and spread them in a circle with gaps around the edges in the paper.

Lay them out, then again apply mulberry, and again apply at the hour of the Sheep (1-3 PM), and apply when night falls. On the first day, it is good to apply mulberry three times. Now, after the hakitate, there are silkworms that remain unhatched in the seeds. Wrap them as before, warm them, and the next day open and examine them for sweeping. This is called either "niban-haki" (second sweeping) or "kari-haki" (temporary sweeping). Generally, it is good to transfer one sheet of seeds into two warada (straw mats). However, when many emerge in the first sweeping and few in the second, make the first into two warada and the second into one thin warada, and observing their quantity, determine the number of warada on the third day when removing the paper. Those damaged during the larval stage

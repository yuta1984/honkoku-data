After the silkworms have molted for the fourth time (niwaoki), when giving them mulberry leaves, unlike during the larval stage, they greatly dislike heat. Therefore, even in the kokai-ya (silkworm house) that was set up from the beginning, once the fourth molting distribution is done, the straw mats should be made thinner than before when placing them on the shelves. In any case, if there are too many silkworms, the heat will also increase, so it is good to do it this way. Of course, facing the kotatsu, as the silkworms multiply, use a separate room where the west wind enters, and set up shelves so that mice cannot reach them.

1. Before the silkworms begin to spin cocoons, prepare mabushi (cocooning frames) made of straw mats or straw coverings, approximately five shaku long and two shaku five sun wide, setting up about eleven of them. Plan to put two silkworm straw mats into one mabushi straw covering, and when the silkworms are ready to spin, distribute them evenly. Stretch three thick ropes under the beams across a span of two and a half ken.

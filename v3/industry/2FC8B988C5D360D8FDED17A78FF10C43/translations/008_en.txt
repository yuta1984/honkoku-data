The silkworms will later develop diseases. Taking the heart leaves of mulberry is only done during the hakitate (initial transfer).
The next day, apply mulberry before dawn, and after breakfast, wash the tips of old grass, remove the ink, dry by fire to make chopsticks, take the silkworms together with the mulberry, and move them to the open spaces around the paper. Then again apply mulberry, and at the two periods of Snake-Monkey (9 AM-5 PM), move them to the open spaces around as before, finish by spreading them across the entire surface, and again apply mulberry that night. Apply each time you move them. On this day, apply five times.
On the third day, the silkworms become wobbly and turn whitish in color. At this time, increase the warada (straw mats) and perform "kami-banashi" (paper removal, also called "nuka-mori" - bran spreading). Dry the straw well, scatter bran thinly, and using chopstick tips, take the silkworms together with the embers and place them across the entire straw mat like arranging go stones. Remove the paper. One sheet of seeds should be spread across six warada. After the bran spreading, apply mulberry, and again apply at the late period of Sheep-Rooster (late afternoon). On this day, apply four times. From this point onward, three times or even four to five times is acceptable. If you can manage it well, apply frequently. Silkworms grow faster according to the number of times mulberry is applied, and will make cocoons earlier.

should be placed. However, if the sleeping is delayed in each raising bed, the fire must definitely be stopped. Compared to the previous awakenings, at this time there is what is called the "funago distant sleep," where the sleeping may be delayed by one or two days. The next sleep will be the "niwaki" (garden awakening). When half have awakened, there is no need to restrict mulberry feeding - cut mulberry leaves into pieces about six to seven bu square and spread them evenly and thinly. <<At this time, they are not at all to be kept together with mulberry>> When they have all awakened, cut the mulberry larger and spread somewhat thickly.

Remember this as "mulberry application." Three days later, carefully prepare the dried straw bundles that were set aside, and divide one bundle into one and a half bundles. If it is a hot season, it is good to divide them on the second day of mulberry application. If the heat is particularly severe, use "leaf mulberry" (uncut mulberry leaves) spread sparsely, and since the silkworms will crawl onto these, move them to separate straw bundles, leaving the remainder thin and suitable for the heated season.

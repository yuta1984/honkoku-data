Test them, and the next day they will all wake up uniformly and mulberry is applied. This is called "mulberry attachment." From then on, apply four times daily for about twelve to thirteen applications, then perform bottom removal, spreading one straw mat into two. This is called "waking bottom removal." From mulberry attachment, after about twenty-two to twenty-three applications, it becomes time for mulberry stopping. For one day of mulberry stopping, the care is the same as the fourth waking care, with the same feeding method until all wake up.

△For the fifth molting (second waking), after mulberry attachment and two to three subsequent mulberry applications, perform bottom removal, spreading one straw mat into two. This is because heat accumulates during the fifth molting, so removal should be done early. Also, perform bottom removal when approaching molting. This is called "stagnation bottom removal." Generally, in the art of raising silkworms, nothing is better than bottom removal after waking. If bottom removal is not performed, old mulberry leaves will accumulate, silkworm excrement will become extremely foul-smelling after the second waking, and the heat will steam and ripen, causing the silkworms to contract diseases from this air. Getting few cocoons results from neglecting bottom removal. At this time, do not spread the straw mats. Generally, after about twenty-two to twenty-three mulberry applications, it becomes time for mulberry stopping.

△For all wakings, third waking attachment, then after three to four applications, perform bottom removal the next day. At this time...

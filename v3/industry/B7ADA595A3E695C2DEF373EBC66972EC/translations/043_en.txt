This is because if they are brought in while still hot from sun-drying, they will not dissolve easily when manufacturing silk thread. Alternatively, when there are continuous morning rains and the cocoons are difficult to dry, some people steam them in steaming baskets or place them in roasting furnaces.

which not only causes the silk to lose its color and luster, but also deteriorates the essential quality of the silk, making it most undesirable. Steaming in steaming baskets is considered a good strategy. Using roasting furnaces is only done when absolutely unavoidable.

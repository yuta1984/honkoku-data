Mount them on shelves and wait for the moths to emerge. If one wishes to harvest cocoons, expose them to the blazing sun to dry for three days before storing. Generally speaking, when bringing them indoors, it is good to do so after the evening sun has already set, allowing the cocoons to receive cool air. This is because if they are brought in while still sun-dried, they will not dissolve easily when it comes to silk production. Alternatively, when there are consecutive days of morning rain and the cocoons are difficult to dry, some people steam them in井楼 (steaming apparatus) or place them on drying ovens.

　　[Note] Ordinarily, drying in the blazing sun is considered the standard method. However, if a long time passes after sun-drying, it becomes difficult to separate the threads during silk production, necessitating intense boiling and simmering,

　　which not only causes the silk to lose its color and luster, but also deteriorates the essential quality of the silk, making it most unsuitable. Steaming in 井楼 (steaming apparatus) is the best strategy. Using drying ovens is merely a method employed only when absolutely unavoidable.

　　　Chapter 2
There is no other technique for selecting cocoons for collecting egg seeds. It depends solely on the quality of the cocoons. This is because silkworms are inherently meant to become silk, so it can be understood without need for argument that the refinement or coarseness of quality is determined by the cocoons.

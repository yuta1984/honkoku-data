　　　Chapter 20
Although the shapes of silkworm rooms and equipment are shown in diagrams, it goes without saying that their size and dimensions should be modified according to one's wealth and the amount of production. The essential points are to ensure that the silkworm room is not exposed to direct morning and evening sunlight, to protect against severe cold and heat, and to prevent stagnation of vapor in the room. If attention is paid to these matters, there should be no major errors.

This is convenient for delicate women to handle. This is indeed a very reasonable opinion.

transferred, and any that were missed are picked up and rice hulls are sprinkled and mixed together, making two baskets from what was originally one basket. Then thin mulberry leaves are fed afterward, taking care that silkworm litter does not accumulate (this is called "yasumi no ura-tori" - litter removal during rest).
　　[Note] Removing silkworm litter should be done twice during the interval between each sleep and waking for all four sleeps. However, when it is extremely hot or rainy and humid, measures should naturally be taken as the situation demands.
　　In this year's experiment, the silkworms entered sleep eleven days from the day of hatching. That is, on March 27th (light rain) the temperature was 65 degrees (at noon) and 64 degrees (morning and evening). This was done relying on natural temperature without borrowing fire power. In Oshu province, fire is particularly

　　In the southern regions of Kozuke province, it is considered good to rely on nature without borrowing fire power. However, if the cold is extreme, fire power is not entirely avoided.
　　This year on April 5th, 6th, and 7th, with cold wind and rain, the temperature remained between 49 to 60 degrees, so fires were lit in the lower floor of the silkworm room.
　　If fire power is used, steam will stagnate in the room and

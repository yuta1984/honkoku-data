whose entire body splits into two halves, with each piece transforming to become a pair of offspring. Or some produce tumor-like flesh in one or several places on the mother's body, and this flesh separates to become offspring. Or some parasitize the mother's body and ultimately never separate. 《Marginal note: This type of reproduction is generally common among zoophytes》

Presumably, reproductive function is a faculty that both animals and plants possess, and there are two types of reproductive organs. Namely, one is the male organ and one is the female organ. The female organ contains egg cells within it, and the male organ stores seminal fluid within it. When this seminal fluid comes into contact with the egg cells in the female organ, it immediately activates the mysterious

However, in higher animals, particularly humans, males necessarily have male organs and females have female organs. We can see that this is also necessarily true for the males and females of other birds and livestock.

The response is: "If, as stated in the physiology books recorded earlier, this occurs due to the location of the insect nest, then why should we doubt only pupae and larvae here?"

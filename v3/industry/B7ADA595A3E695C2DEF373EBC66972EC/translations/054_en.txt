Generally, in animal sexual reproduction, there are two types of conditions. That is, one type occurs through reproductive function, and one type occurs without this function. The latter type is seen only in the most primitive insects, where sometimes the entire mother insect dissolves to become many embryonic cells, and each cell simultaneously transforms into numerous offspring, or where the mother insect

Some offspring do not resemble their parents, just as in the case of silkworm moths. These insects that do not resemble their parents do not change form throughout their lives, but the children they produce also do not resemble their parents and instead are similar to the original egg-laying mother. This can truly be called strange.

Perhaps the reason why forms change successively during hatching and development is entirely because the yin and yang transformations naturally differ according to the location of the insect's nest.

If this is indeed the case, then the hatching of insect eggs carried in from outside within the abdomen of animals, producing a kind of

Generally, in sexual reproduction of animals, there are two types of conditions. One is through reproductive function, and one is not through this function. The latter type is seen only in the most primitive insects, where sometimes the entire mother insect dissolves to become many embryonic spheres, and each sphere simultaneously transforms into numerous offspring. Or the mother insect

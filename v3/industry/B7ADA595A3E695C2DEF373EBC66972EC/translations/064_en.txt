Regarding silk reeling equipment, the conventional machines were designed for one person to reel one thread, but recently there are machines that reel two threads. While there is no harm if proper attention is paid, when hired workers do the reeling, even if one or two or three threads break, they continue reeling as is, and when it becomes necessary to add other cocoons, they fail to search for the thread ends to connect them properly. This results in tangled threads that cause great inconvenience when used.

In Maebashi, there is a small silk reeling machine. A samurai named Hayamizu Kenzō made a proposal to his former feudal lord and hired a Swiss person to construct it.

It operates using a water wheel mechanism. The thread produced by this machine has the reputation of being of the finest quality. This is the pioneering use of machinery. This matter must be mentioned for Hayamizu's sake.

A silk reeling factory is being constructed in Tomioka and is nearly completed. It uses steam engines and is quite magnificent. When fully completed, we should eagerly await the production of superior raw silk.

Regarding the construction of silkworm rooms, the methods of Shimamura are considered superior to those of other regions. This was accomplished through the combined efforts of Tajima Kuniyasu, Tajima Buhei, and several others. This must be mentioned for the sake of the sericulturists of Shimamura.

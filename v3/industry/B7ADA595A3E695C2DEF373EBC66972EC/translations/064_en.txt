Regarding silk reeling machinery, while traditional domestic machines were operated by one person producing one thread, recently there are machines that can reel multiple threads at once. If properly supervised, there is no harm, but when hired workers operate the reeling process, even if one or two or three threads break, they continue reeling as is, and when they must add other cocoons, they fail to find the broken thread ends and connect them properly. This causes the threads to become tangled and creates major inconveniences when the silk is used.

In Maebashi, there is a small silk reeling apparatus. A samurai named Hayamizu Kenzo made a proposal to his former domain lord and hired a Swiss person to construct it.

It operates using a water wheel mechanism. The silk produced by this machine has a reputation for being of the finest quality. This was the pioneer in using mechanical apparatus. This matter must be mentioned for Hayamizu's sake.

A silk reeling bureau is being constructed in Tomioka and is nearly complete. It uses steam engines and is quite grand in scale. When it is fully completed, we should wipe our eyes and wait to see the silk achieve fine quality.

Regarding silkworm room construction, the Shimamura method is considered superior to other regions. This was accomplished through the combined efforts of Tajima Kuniyasu, Tajima Buhei, and several others. This must be mentioned for the sake of Shimamura's sericulturists.

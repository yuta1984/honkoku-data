Around the first and second months, cut the original stock that has reached four to five years at about five sun remaining in the ground, and apply approximately five gō of fertilizer around it. Following the seasonal temperature changes, tender shoots will emerge and grow to eight to nine sun or one to two shaku. Remove the leaves from these branch shoots, leaving only the terminal buds, bend them into the ground and cover with soil, as shown in figures one, two, and three.

When the soil covering the grown branches is removed, fibrous roots can be seen growing from the branches that were initially bent and buried in the ground. These are harvested as they are, as shown in figure five.

　　　Chapter Twelve
Cut off one-third of the total length from the tip of the harvested branch shoots, also trim the root portion appropriately, leaving two sun of fibrous roots and cutting away the excess. Dig the soil to a depth of over one shaku, insert the layered cuttings, fill with fertilizer and refuse materials, cover with soil, and firmly compact the ground.

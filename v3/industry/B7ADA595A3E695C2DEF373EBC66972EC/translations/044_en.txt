When carefully selecting cocoons, those that are round and smooth, which release thread ends when rotated by hand, with white ones becoming increasingly white and yellow ones becoming increasingly yellow, naturally possessing brilliance - these are precisely high-quality cocoons. Such cocoons, when used to produce egg seeds, yield the finest offspring, and when made into silk, also become superior thread.

Generally, those that have received thorough care should number approximately 260-270 to around 300 cocoons per sho (unit of measure), which is considered top grade. Those with uneven sizes lacking luster, where one sho contains 350 or even 370-380 cocoons, are of the lowest grade, and when made into silk

are still not of fine quality. How much more so when it comes to egg seeds. If one attempts to produce egg seeds using such inferior material, it should be said that one is inviting disaster upon oneself.

After examining in advance the cocoons from which moths are about to emerge and covering them with paper, the emerged moths will crawl up onto the paper around 7-8 o'clock in the morning, where male and female will mate. Taking them as they are onto another paper, place them in a basket lined with matting and keep them quiet. Around 2 o'clock in the afternoon, release the male moths and retain only the female moths. If you move them slightly while still on the paper, they will inevitably urinate. Place this on seed paper with edge wood《marginal note: one sun and two bu by carpenter's square}}

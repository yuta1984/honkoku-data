Tall trees can be used as silkworm feed after five years of cultivation, flourish from about ten to forty years, then gradually decline. With thorough cultivation, some remain vigorous even after seventy years. Their total height ranges from about one jō five shaku to over two jō (approximately 4.5-6 meters), and only the leaves are picked using ladders. Particularly when branches and leaves begin to decline, they are cut from about two sun above the branching point of the trunk, and ink is applied to the cut surface to prevent decay—then they will sprout and flourish again. Round-leafed varieties called Nakazawa mulberry are considered excellent.

Tall stocks are cut at five or seven shaku, whatever height is appropriate, and the leafy branches that have grown are harvested for use. Those called Sagami mulberry are considered excellent.

　　For silkworms from one sheet of original seed, seventy-five bundles are required [Note: This equals twelve and a half horse loads when packed on horses]

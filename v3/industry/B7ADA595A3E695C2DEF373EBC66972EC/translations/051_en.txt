Thus, many did not accept Harvey's brilliant insights until recent times.

According to those opposing theories, lower animals and plants, especially molds and microorganisms, arise from ordinary matter (mucus, proteins, etc.) through the influence and nurturing of air, water, temperature (or electricity).

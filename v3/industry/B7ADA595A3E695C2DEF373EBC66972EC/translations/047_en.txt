In raising silkworms, there are two things that cause great worry: disease and maggots. There are several types of diseases: fushigo (node disease), yasuмazu (sleeplessness), kashirasuki (head transparency), akaruko (lifting disease), koshyari (silkworm relic disease), and others. Since the lifespan of silkworms is only several tens of days, when they develop disease, they are truly in a critical state, and there is no time to save them before the disaster spreads throughout the entire room. Therefore, preventing disaster before it occurs should be considered the best strategy. While raising silkworms does not require excessive worry during normal times, one should pay attention to cold, heat, and rain humidity. Among these, the power of heat should be most carefully guarded against. When comparing the harm of heat and cold, heat

accounts for eight-tenths of the harm.

　　　Chapter 12
The causes of silkworm diseases arise from cold, heat, rain, and humidity, but their outbreak is most often due to inappropriate feed and putrefaction toxins. During the period from hatching to the second molting, when silkworms are smallest and most fragile, even with the most careful and loving care, many are lost and damaged during daily handling or each time the silkworm beds are changed. When calculating the number of eggs on one paper, by the time of final maturation, nearly one-third are reduced. From this we can conclude that dividing the whole into three parts: one part dies young, one part consists of injured ones that grow through the power of loving care, and one part

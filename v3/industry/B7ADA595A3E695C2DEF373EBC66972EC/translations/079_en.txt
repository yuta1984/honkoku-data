　　　Trial Record of Shinshū Wind Cave Silkworm Eggs
Shinshū has long been known as a land of sericulture, famous for both 
silkworm eggs and egg production. In this province, near Matsumoto in 
Kamikanbayashi Village, there is a cave in the mountain cliff. Even during 
the intense heat of midsummer, the cave interior remains cold with 
wind-like air flow. The locals call this a "wind cave" and regularly 
store various items there to prevent decay. Sericulture farmers store 
surplus spring silkworm eggs in this cave to prevent hatching. 
After completing one cycle of spring silkworm work and gaining some 
leisure time, when they retrieve these eggs, they hatch within days. 
Since these are not second-generation or summer silkworm varieties, 
both the cocoons and silk are beautiful and of high quality.

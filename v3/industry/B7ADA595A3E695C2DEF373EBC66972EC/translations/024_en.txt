storing [pollen], and also opening and closing in the morning and evening. Also, in the center of the stamens there is one short pistil-like structure, and as shown in the enlarged figure number seventeen, it stores viscous liquid at its tip and eventually bears fruit. This is where the male flower transforms and changes into female characteristics. Furthermore, dividing the entire flower into three parts, the several small spherical structures in the two parts close to the main branch are female in nature with no flowers, having only two short triangular stamens that surround the pistil and form fruit by receiving pollen from male flowers.

Therefore, here from among the classes established by this same gentleman, we classify [mulberry] as belonging to the so-called "Polygamia" genus of the twenty-third class, with one type mixing male and female flowers or having perfect flowers, and another type being the two kinds where male and female stocks are different.

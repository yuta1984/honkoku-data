1. This book divides its essentials into four major sections: mulberry cultivation, 
   sericulture, seed production, and silk reeling. Within each section there are 
   various small subsections that explain their sequence. Additionally, the essentials 
   of sericulture are discussed separately at the beginning of the volume to provide 
   a general overview of their utility, and furthermore, statistics on the approximate 
   numbers of domestic silkworm eggs and silk reeling are compiled and attached 
   at the end. The reason this is named "Sericulture Compendium" is that it adopts 
   the meaning of gathering and achieving greatness in all matters related to silkworms.
1. Silkworms are small insects that emerge due to the gentle warm air of late spring, 
   and in merely thirty-odd days they form cocoons and transform their appearance.

　　They transform once more within thirty days to become moths, deposit their 
　　eggs, and complete their lives. Therefore, the success or failure of their rearing 
　　and growth truly occurs within a brief time, and the minutiae of their methods 
　　cannot all be fully described in writing. Here, the differences in timing, climate, 
　　food amounts, etc., that were tested under actual conditions this year are 
　　presented in tables and attached as an appendix to this main text. This should 
　　be sufficient to somewhat illuminate the subtle mysteries.
1. When one silkworm makes one cocoon, and two cocoons produce male and female 
   moths, generally one silkworm can increase nearly three hundredfold. The standard 
   limit usually obtained from sericulture in our country is from one sheet of silkworm 
   eggs (marginal note: 56,000 eggs)

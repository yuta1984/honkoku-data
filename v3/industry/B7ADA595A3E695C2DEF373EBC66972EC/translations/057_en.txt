However, when I traveled through and inspected other mountain villages, I found that they generally produce cocoon silk during their spare time from farming. Their mulberry groves are surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the soil quality is dense and sticky, so the trees cannot flourish unless they are tall trees and high-stemmed varieties. This is because their geographical location is remote and the transportation of fertilizer is not easy, so they rely solely on natural rain and dew for nourishment and growth. Therefore, one should understand that the root stocks do not have the power to flourish unless several years have passed. When I happened to observe root-cut mulberry trees, the branches and leaves were withered and wilted. This is precisely the origin of the theory that tall trees and high stems are good for silk thread, while riverside ones are suitable for silkworm eggs.

Hanawa Village and Omama Town in Seta District have a fine reputation for silk thread. This is because the water flow is clear and pure, making it suitable for silk production. They also skillfully manufacture flat silk. The pure white amber and dragon-gate twill woven in Kiryu, Yamada District, requires white cocoon silk from Hanawa and Omama. {{Note: In this region and neighboring villages, the cultivation of tall trees and high stems is superior to all other areas}}. I believe that the people of Hanawa and Omama not only use local products but also purchase cocoons from other areas to manufacture silk. One should understand that the fineness or coarseness of silk thread depends on careful manufacturing and the quality of the water.

Nitayama Village in Yamada District, Shimonita Village in Kanra District, and their neighboring villages also have a fine reputation for silk thread. In regions that specialize in silk production like these...

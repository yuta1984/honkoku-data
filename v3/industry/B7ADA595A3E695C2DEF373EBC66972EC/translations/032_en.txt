early mulberry leaves also begin to sprout somewhat, so there is no need to doubt or fear about hastening the period of silkworm metamorphosis.

　　[Note] When one wishes to delay silkworm metamorphosis, it is acceptable to leave them in boxes in earthen storehouses or cold places, preventing outside air from reaching them. It is said that there are no particular advantages or disadvantages regarding this timing adjustment.

　　　Chapter Two
Setting the period of silkworm egg metamorphosis at approximately ninety days from Risshun is the standard timing for natural seasonal rearing in the Sai District area of Jōshū Province.

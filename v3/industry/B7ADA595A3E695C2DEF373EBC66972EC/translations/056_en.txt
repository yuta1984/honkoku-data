Again someone asks: "When summer silkworms and second-generation silkworms are raised, the occurrence of pupae and maggots is extremely rare.

Among these, the various villages of Sai District are located on flat land along the Tone River, so the mulberry cultivated along the riverbank is harvested annually to raise silkworms. Not only is the soil quality suitable for mulberry trees, but because they put the greatest effort into cultivation and farming, the mulberry leaves are of excellent quality. When silkworms are raised with these leaves, they grow strong and healthy, and produce numerous eggs.

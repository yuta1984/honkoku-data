What are called "tall stocks" are not convenient. It is best to cut them down and use them annually. According to the explanation of local people, generally mulberry cultivation fields are suitable for riverbanks mixed with sand and gravel, while land at mountain foothills or adjacent to houses is not good. This is for no other reason than that mulberry does not favor excessive moisture.

Indeed, riverside fields may be violently flooded during periods of continuous rain, but they also dry quickly, and being open on all sides, air circulation is appropriate. What grows in such land has thick leaves and stores nutrients suitable for raising silkworms.

Land at mountain foothills or adjacent to houses is generally poorly ventilated and has wet soil, so the mulberry naturally contains much water due to its nature. Those cultivated in fertile fields are also similar to this. This is because mulberry trees are planted along the four boundaries where vegetables and grains are grown, and because their value is high, the distance between individual plants is very close, or mulberry trees are planted throughout the entire garden, becoming extremely dense. As they flourish, the land has no time to dry, and the stuffiness becomes severe - like plants grown in a greenhouse. This is the reason why it is unsuitable.

do not exist. Now I present one or two theories here to serve as material for examination.

1. Silkworm raisers say that when feeding with mulberry cultivated on well-drained sandy gravel land along riverbanks, all produce moths, while when raising with mulberry from land near the foot of forests close to houses, maggots are often produced. This has apparently become common knowledge not only in Kōzuke Province but among all silkworm raisers in the eastern provinces. For this reason, Sai District, which lies entirely along the Tone River basin, specializes in silkworm egg production, while regions like Kanra District and Midorino District, which are adjacent to mountainsides and forest foothills, focus on cocoon harvesting and deliberately avoid silkworm egg production.

1. According to recent Western theories, pupae and maggots from the previous year overwinter in the silkworm room and transform into flies at the same time as silkworm eggs hatch. These flies pierce the silkworm bodies and deposit maggot eggs. Rather, it is better to capture and exterminate the maggots completely. This is said to be the method for eliminating maggot eggs.

1. In order to test the validity of these two theories, the following experiment was conducted:

1. Two hundred hairy silkworms were divided into two groups and placed in baskets covered and stretched with silk. In one basket, dozens of flies and maggots were allowed to cohabitate, while the other basket was made so that maggots and flies could not penetrate

are nonexistent. Now I present one or two theories here for examination and verification.

1. Silkworm raisers say that when feeding with mulberry cultivated on open sandy and gravelly land along riverbanks, all produce moths, while when raising with mulberry from land near the foot of forests close to houses, maggots are often produced. This has probably become the common belief not only in Kōzuke Province but among all silkworm raisers in the eastern provinces. Therefore, in all of Sai District along the Tone River, they specialize in silkworm egg production, while regions like Kanra and Ryōno Districts, which are adjacent to mountain slopes and forest foothills, focus on cocoon harvesting and dare not engage in silkworm egg production.

1. According to recent Western theories, pupae and maggots from the previous year overwinter in the silkworm room and transform into flies at the same time as silkworm eggs hatch. These flies pierce the silkworm bodies and deposit maggot seeds. It is better to capture and exterminate the maggots. This is the way to eliminate the maggot species.

1. To test the validity of both theories above, the following experiment was conducted:

1. Two hundred hairy silkworms were divided into two groups and placed in cages covered and stretched with silk. In one cage, dozens of flies and maggots were allowed to cohabit, while the other cage prevented maggots and flies from being able to penetrate

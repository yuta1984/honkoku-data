Even comparing it to soil would still be insufficient. Silkworms have no lungs, and their entire body serves the function of lungs (Note: Probably not only silkworms but also other caterpillars and cicadas, dragonflies and similar insects must also be this way). Their organs are extremely small, and in addition, compared to their whole body, the head is the smallest part, making it impossible to detect the presence or absence of nasal passages. Even if they were equipped with nasal passages, if they are so small that they cannot be seen even with a microscope, it is clear without argument that they would not be suitable for handling the respiration of the entire body.

Western physiology books state: "The sending and receiving of breath originally uses the nasal passages as the proper route. However, it can also be sent and received well through the mouth. Indeed, if there were no other gateway for respiration besides the nasal passages, anyone whose nasal passages became blocked would inevitably face the danger of suffocation. This too is the profound intention of the Creator's endowment of life—how can we not be grateful for this?"

Figure 1 of Number 18 shows the body section as seen through a microscope, with six extremely small eye holes on each side, left and right, with eyebrows around them, as seen from the front. Figure 2 shows the side view, Figure 3 shows the view from under the jaw, Figure 4 shows the silk-spinning pores, Figure 5 shows the breathing pores, and Figure 6 shows the form of the tracheal tubes and meridians that connect internally.

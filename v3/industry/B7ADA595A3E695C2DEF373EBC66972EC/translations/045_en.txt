《marginal note: Apply lacquer to square wood of two sun by one sun, with vertical and horizontal measurements made to correspond to the seed paper dimensions》Apply a little oil to demarcate the four edges of the seed paper, preventing the moths from being able to escape elsewhere.

　　[Note] For example, when using one sheet of seed paper, one demarcates its four edges, but when arranging dozens or hundreds of papers in rows, one does not set boundaries for each individual paper, but only demarcates the four edges of the entire arrangement of thousands of sheets.

The appropriate room temperature is between 70 and 80 degrees. If egg laying is to be conducted on a cold day, arrange several braziers in the room and adjust the warmth appropriately, then egg production will occur. However, moths that have been improperly reared from the beginning will not produce eggs as desired at this stage, no matter how much effort is expended. Generally, to produce one sheet densely, 90 to 120 superior moths are used, laying eggs from 2-3 o'clock in the afternoon until 4 o'clock the following dawn. After 4 o'clock in the morning, move them to other paper.

　　[Note] Once dawn arrives, their strength is nearly exhausted and they produce inferior eggs, so they are discarded elsewhere.

If moths emerged from inferior cocoons, then 150 or perhaps

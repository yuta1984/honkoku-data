According to this theory, they explain the reasons why intestinal worms, brain worms, internal worms, eye worms, etc. are generated, saying that they all arise from abnormal changes in nutritive fluids.

Also, without this theory, it would be impossible to explain how worms are generated within animal bodies - this is what this school of thought relies upon most heavily.

Now, since internal parasites like intestinal worms have never been observed outside the body, it is indeed difficult to consider them as arising from eggs brought in from outside. However, this is ultimately due to insufficient investigation and experimentation. Therefore, if scholars open their eyes even more carefully, they should be able to confirm that this theory is not entirely unfounded.

For example, if one puts fresh juice from grass roots (selecting the most easily corrupted type) into a glass bottle and boils it, it goes without saying that all living microorganisms contained within are already completely destroyed, but now when this bottle is removed from the fire and its mouth is opened to expose it to outside air,

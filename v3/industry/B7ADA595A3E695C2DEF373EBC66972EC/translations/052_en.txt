Moreover, this theory explained the reasons why intestinal worms, brain worms, internal worms, and eye worms are generated, stating that they all arise from abnormal changes in nutritive fluids.

The reason for believing this theory of spontaneous generation is that people only observe living things arising from organic putrefying matter, without yet knowing that eggs of insects and seeds of plants have already been mixed into that material. Furthermore, the belief that without this theory one cannot explain how worms are generated within animal bodies is what this school of thought relies upon most.

Indeed, since internal parasites like intestinal worms have never been seen outside the body, it is difficult to consider that they actually arise from eggs transported from outside. However, this is ultimately due to insufficient investigation and verification. Therefore, if scholars open their eyes even more keenly, it should be sufficient to confirm that this theory cannot be completely denied.

For example, when fresh juice from grass roots (selecting those most prone to decay) is placed in a glass vessel and boiled, it naturally destroys all living microorganisms contained within. But now when this vessel is removed from the fire and its mouth is opened to expose it to outside air,

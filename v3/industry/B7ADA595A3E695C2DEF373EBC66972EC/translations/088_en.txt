but it changes accordingly depending on the color and luster of the substance contained within. Initially after laying, a pale yellow seminal fluid passes through transparently to form that color.

Figure No. 2 shows how, as some time passes and the egg is exposed to the atmosphere, it gradually develops the silkworm body, thereby revealing its form and color on the outer surface. There are two depressions in the egg body, one large and one small. The large one forms an oval shape due to natural indentation caused by the curved silkworm body inside, while the small one is connected to the silkworm's tail with a cord and is designed for the silkworm to gnaw through and crawl out when it hatches. Most importantly, protein-based mucus is stored between the silkworm body and the outer skin.

Figure No. 3 shows the actual form and enlarged diagram of eggs that have undergone催青 (saisei - incubation preparation) as the hatching period approaches. However, although the outer surface turns blue due to the growth of the silkworm body, the white color of the skin remains unchanged.

Chapter 4
When dissecting the egg granules described previously, as shown in Figure 4, several hair-like filaments cluster together due to mucus and develop shortly after being exposed to outside air.

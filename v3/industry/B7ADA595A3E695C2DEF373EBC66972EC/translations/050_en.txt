but in both cases, moths and maggots appeared in equal proportions.

1. [Note] Based on this experiment, the silkworm raisers' theory appears to be closer to the truth. In contrast, the Western theory that flies, having originally transformed from pupae and maggots, do not forget their previous birth and leave their species behind, is almost reminiscent of the Buddhist concept of karmic retribution. How can this not be called a far-fetched and absurd theory?
Upon careful consideration, as recorded previously, silkworms that were injured in their early stages but fortunately grew through nurturing care, having labored and become exhausted from the great work of cocoon formation,

likely develop the harm of decay and maggot generation from their old wounds. Given this, and observing the many years of experience cited by silkworm raisers as well as this year's experiments, while the theory that flies pierce and attach maggot species should not be adopted, it is most difficult to explain the clear reasoning behind the claim that feeding with high-quality mulberry prevents maggots. Upon examining the physiological texts recorded below, the causes of maggot generation have proven sufficient to demonstrate that they possess a kind of natural principle. Therefore, I extract and append the following

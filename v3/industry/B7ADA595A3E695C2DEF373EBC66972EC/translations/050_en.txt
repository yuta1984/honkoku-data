both resulted in half moths and half maggots.

1. [Analysis] Based on this experiment, the silkworm raisers' theory appears to be correct. In contrast, the Western theory that flies, having originally transformed from pupae and maggots, do not forget their previous existence and lay eggs, resembles the Buddhist concept of karmic retribution. How can this not be called far-fetched nonsense?

Upon careful consideration, as previously recorded, silkworms that were injured in their youth but fortunately grew to maturity through careful nurturing, having exhausted themselves in the arduous work of cocoon formation, likely develop the harm of decay and maggot generation from their old wounds.

This being so, when observing the many years of experience cited by silkworm raisers and this year's experiments, although the theory that flies inject maggot eggs should not be adopted, it is most difficult to explain the definitive principle that feeding high-quality mulberry prevents maggot formation. Research into the physiology books recorded below proves that the cause of maggot generation has a kind of natural principle. Therefore, I extract the key points and append the following

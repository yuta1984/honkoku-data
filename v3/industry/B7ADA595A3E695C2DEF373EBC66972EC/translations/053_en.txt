then after a short time, mold and maggots will develop across the entire surface of the liquid. However, if at this time sulfuric acid or a similar liquid is placed at the bottle's mouth to make the outside air pass through this liquid (this is set up to completely destroy the microorganisms in the air), even if this juice is stored for several months, mold and maggots will never develop. From observing this, it is clear that the seeds of mold and maggots are necessarily carried by outside air and do not arise from the decay of the squeezed juice.

However, scholars of that time who advocated the theory of sexual reproduction were greatly troubled only by the question of why internal parasites exist

and had not yet been able to fully grasp the truth that would provide an answer. Recently, having accidentally discovered the strange states of insect life, they were finally able to understand this principle.

That is, when observing invertebrates, some that emerge from eggs initially have incomplete forms but undergo successive transformations before acquiring their complete form.

For example, this can be seen in how silkworms first emerge from eggs, then transform into cocoons, and finally metamorphose into moths. Or again, when small insect eggs hatch and produce offspring, those offspring

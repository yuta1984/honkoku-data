and had not yet been able to fully grasp the truth that could answer this. But recently, since the accidental discovery of the peculiar state of insect life, they were able to understand this principle for the first time.

For example, this should be viewed like how silkworms are first born from eggs, transform into cocoons in the middle stage, and finally metamorphose into moths. Or again, when small insect eggs hatch and produce offspring, those offspring

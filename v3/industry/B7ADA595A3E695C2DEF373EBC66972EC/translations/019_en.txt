The three counties of Kanra, Tone, and Yamada in Kōzuke Province (present-day Gunma Prefecture) are all remote mountain villages adjacent to the deep mountains of neighboring provinces. Many areas are famous for silk production. Among them, villages such as Shimonita, Hanawa, Ōmama, and Nitayama produce particularly renowned silk. In this region, they exclusively cultivate two types: tall trees (kōju) and tall stocks (kōkabu).

　　　Chapter Sixteen
For both tall trees and tall stocks, layering is considered the preferred method, while seed sowing is considered unfavorable. Although plants grown from seeds may last longer, if one is even slightly careless, good varieties often change and become coarse in nature. Therefore, layering is considered the better method.

The cultivation method involves digging plots six shaku square and three shaku deep, removing poor soil and stone blocks, filling with one shaku of good quality soil, and planting the layered cuttings. The depressed areas are periodically filled with dust, dirt, and decayed grass, reaching nearly level with the ground after about one year. This method is the same for both tall trees and tall stocks.

　　　Chapter Eighteen
Although fertilizers such as dust, dirt, and stable manure are necessary, they do not apply large amounts. This is because the spacing between stocks is very wide, and vegetables are sown and planted in between, so the fertilizer applied to these naturally benefits the mulberry trees as well.

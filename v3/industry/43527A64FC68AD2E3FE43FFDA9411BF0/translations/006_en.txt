or in fields - generally trees grown in land where cultivation is difficult.
They can also be planted on riverbanks as splash guards, serving as flood control. Sandy soil or true soil with good moisture content is best; when planted in fertile soil with adequate water, growth is rapid in a short time. Countries that have mastered the secrets of sericulture often develop wastelands and wilderness, planting along riverbanks and deep in mountains, and even in remote valleys and isolated places, they raise silkworms to obtain enormous profits. The "Shangshu Dazhuan" states: "Emperors and feudal lords must have public mulberry groves and silkworm rooms." Fundamentally, sericulture in any country is mostly women's work, not requiring men's labor, and through spare effort from farming, one can earn great money - this is truly the primary means of supporting farmers and enriching the nation. Even in foreign countries it is said: "Plant mulberry trees on a five-mu homestead." However, countries that still do not practice this have much wasteland where useless vegetation grows thick, creating idle land in vain - is this not lamentable?

Though one may know this, silkworm rearing involves many secrets in the breeding methods and is extremely difficult, so without knowing the oral traditions of cultivation, attempting it carelessly will result in great losses. However, those skilled in rearing methods gain profits year after year, and with that surplus they can acquire much farmland or develop wasteland, potentially increasing their wealth a hundredfold. Even a single household can achieve this much. How much more so if an entire village or district does likewise - such wealth would overflow in all directions, making the country as prosperous as the gentleness of spring, truly an urgent matter for governing the world and bringing peace to the people.

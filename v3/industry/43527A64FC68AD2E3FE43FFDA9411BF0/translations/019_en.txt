Therefore, one should carefully examine the source eggs, seek the best possible eggs, and make sure there are no shortcuts in the rearing method - this is of primary importance.

A Story of Someone Who Became Prosperous Through the Virtue of Silkworms

There was a man from Usui District in Joshu Province who lost his father at a young age and served his mother with filial piety. Since the family was originally poor, they could not even make cooking fires morning and evening, and he spent his days suffering from hunger and cold together with his wife and children. Thinking deeply that at this rate he would have no means to support his mother and wondering what would become of their future, he concluded that nothing surpasses sericulture for obtaining great profits. Wishing somehow to learn the technique and allow his mother to live in peace, he planted mulberry trees in his small fields, relied on experts to learn their rearing methods, and continued to devise improvements, raising silkworms in various ways. Within five or six years he gained great profits, purchased vast amounts of additional farmland, became a wealthy household renowned throughout the neighboring villages, allowed his mother to live comfortably, and his descendants also continued to prosper. This must be because Heaven responds to the virtue of filial piety.

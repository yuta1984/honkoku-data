　　　On overcoming prolonged rain during the silkworms' peak period
One year, from the third instar period of silkworms until the fourth instar awakening, heavy rain fell continuously every day, with particularly severe cold winds, and silkworms throughout the provinces suffered greatly. At that time, there was a skilled sericulturist in a certain village who lit fires in about three places inside his house, warmed the places where the silkworms were kept to an appropriate degree, and raised them with various ingenious methods. As a result, they did not suffer from the rain and humidity, achieving the best harvest in that village. People who later heard of this method were all impressed, it is said.

　　　Similarly, on an example of preventing heat damage
One year, from before the fourth instar of silkworms, the heat was particularly intense, and with hot, humid south winds, silkworms in various provinces suffered greatly. There was an elderly person in a certain place, a very wise individual, who thought that this heat would not continue for an exceptionally long time. He placed a winnowing fan at the large entrance, directing wind from outside to inside. As a result, this person's silkworms did not suffer at all from the heat and achieved an excellent harvest.

Again, one year from the fourth instar awakening, the heat was severe to the point where even people could barely endure it. Remembering the example of overcoming heat with the winnowing fan, he prepared seven or eight large fans in advance. Using these, his family members fanned around the silkworm shelves every day. The silkworms did not suffer at all and produced an excellent harvest. This person, being of good character, sent people around to neighboring areas to teach this method, and all achieved excellent harvests. Such matters (are important).

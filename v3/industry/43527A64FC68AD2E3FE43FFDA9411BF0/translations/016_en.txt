It's when you're almost down and your guard is relaxed that mistakes occur." This matter was written by Kenkō as an aside with his brush, and people know it well.

Silk reeling methods - oral traditions

When silkworms have already become cocoons, silk should be taken from the fifth or sixth day onward. There are many different methods in different regions.

There is an oral tradition for this: they make a small ring from horse tail hair or women's hair and tie it to the rim of the pot, pass the threads through this hole, and wind them onto bamboo frames as shown in the diagram

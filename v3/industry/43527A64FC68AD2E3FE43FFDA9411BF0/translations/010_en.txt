An example of preventing heat damage
One year, from the silkworms' garden-front stage onward, the heat was exceptionally strong, and with the south wind it became very sultry, so silkworms suffered greatly in various regions. There was an elderly person in a certain place who was extremely wise. Thinking that this heat would not last exceptionally long, he devised a plan: he placed a winnowing basket at the large entrance and directed wind from outside to inside. As a result, this person's silkworms were not damaged by the heat at all and produced an excellent crop.

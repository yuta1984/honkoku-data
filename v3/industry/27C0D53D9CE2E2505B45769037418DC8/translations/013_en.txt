Things with odors like tobacco are particularly bad. Even if it is a new board, boards with the fragrance of maki or hinoki wood should be put in boiling water to remove bubbles well and eliminate the scent before use. Boards used for the first time should first be wiped with mugwort before use.

First, on the third day from the initial stage, the insects' heads turn white. This is called "sleeping" (molting). There is no change in the rearing method. Now, from the first day, after more than ten days, they become very sleepy for the first time. During this sleeping period, they definitely do not eat mulberry leaves but raise their heads and rest. This is called the "first sleep." About seven days later, they sleep for the second time. This is also done in the same manner as described above.

About seven days later, there is the "third sleep," and they rest as described above. About seven days after this comes the "fourth sleep," which is the final sleep.

After this third sleep, whole mulberry leaves are used, and one should check on them countless times per day, scattering leaves and raising and nurturing them. During this period, the sound of eating leaves rustles constantly, seeming particularly busy, so if one becomes careless and lets the mulberry leaves wither or run short, the cocoons will inevitably become thin, scatter in the wind, with very little silk or cotton, full of knots and weak. This is called "poor cocoons" or "coarse raw cocoons." In some places, they are called "inferior cocoons," which means the same thing.

First, one should carefully observe when they enter the first sleep. For example, among ten insects...

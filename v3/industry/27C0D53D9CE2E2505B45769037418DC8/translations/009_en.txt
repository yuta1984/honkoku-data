1. Shiratama (White Jewel): This too is a superior cocoon, particularly white in color. The cocoon is plump and round in shape. Both top and bottom are well-formed. However, when made into thread, it is said to be somewhat weak. This probably depends on regional differences.

1. Kanamaru (Gold Round): This too is a firm cocoon that is white in color. Like kinmenuki, it has the middle constricted with a ridge-like quality. When made into thread, it is adequate. This also probably depends on the local climate and conditions.

1. Ishimaru (Stone Round): This has a dull color with a pale yellowish tint. It is abundant in Kanto cocoons. When this type of cocoon is raised particularly carelessly, and the preparation of mulberry leaves is poor, when drawing it into thread the mouth does not open well, appearing jagged, lacking the proper luster of thread, and when made into textiles, instead of becoming cotton-like, it becomes fluffy, and

the standing threads scatter and fray, making the textile extremely weak. However, even with this thread variety, if raised in places like Kamigata or Goshu, it can achieve medium-to-high quality results. Although it certainly depends on the soil and water of each locality and province, generally because the rearing methods throughout the process are slovenly, the cocoons become dry and lack oil, and the thread naturally lacks viscosity. Therefore, in the hands of skilled practitioners, inferior varieties can become superior, while superior ones can become inferior. The cocoons made by silkworms fed by unskilled people who carelessly provide mulberry leaves are all inferior, poor-quality cocoons. For this reason, these oral teachings are roughly written down and made known, item by item, as follows. Furthermore, one should pay ever closer attention and learn to understand these methods.

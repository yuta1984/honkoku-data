Now, from the time when the mulberry trees bud and the spring leaf buds stand and spread like hands, the silkworms will hatch. When insects and leaves hatch simultaneously, this corresponds well with the season and the timing is good. Among these, if the insects hatch early while the mulberry leaves are late, first prevent those insects from hatching by placing them in a storehouse, between floorboards, or under tatami mats to cool them - this will stop the hatching and make them hatch later. "Hatching" means that the seeds attached to the paper receive warm energy and swell from the size of poppy seeds to about the size of mustard seeds - this is called hatching. When those seeds swell and the silkworms naturally emerge, this is called

First, even if the silkworms on the seed paper appear slightly swollen, if there are not yet mulberry leaves suitable for raising them, one should wait as described above. Also, if the mulberry leaves have grown abundantly ahead of the insects, the seed paper should be warmed. However, one must never hold it directly over fire or roast it. If there are many seeds, place a brazier with buried coals inside a cupboard so that it becomes gently warm, making the inside of the cupboard warm without being noticeable anywhere in particular. Then wrap the seed paper in one or two layers of furoshiki cloth, place it inside, and frequently...

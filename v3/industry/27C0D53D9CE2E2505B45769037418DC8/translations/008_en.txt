The general term of calling those cocoons where insects have emerged due to carelessness during collection "cotton cocoons" - separating them based on this distinction - is unavoidable.

1. It is wrong to call fine silkworm cocoons "kinkaoji" (gold beetle larvae) and such. Writing them as "kinko" (gold child) is also incorrect. "Kinko" (silk child) is the general term for high-quality cocoons that should be drawn into thread and made into textiles. Therefore, what are called "large groups" are firmly made, nicely large, and of single construction. Among these are also what are called "small groups," "kaya-nari" and such. They are somewhat elongated with clear colors and appear beautiful. These are considered the finest cocoons.

1. What are called "kinmenuki" (gold eye-guards) are yellow cocoons that are somewhat flattened at both ends. They are cocoons with the middle part constricted as if tied. These are cocoons where the front and back ends are accustomed and not pointed, and these too are of superior quality.

1. What are called "small round cocoons" are what the world calls "Tanba variety." They have the character of cocoons from Tanba and are mostly yellow. These have no constriction and appear plump in shape. In Tanba too, there are many white cocoons of this shape. When made into thread, they are strong. Kinmenuki are abundant in Echizen varieties, so they are also called "Echizen cocoons." However, since they do not come exclusively from that province, they are called both "small round cocoons" and "kinmenuki." These are local terms from various provinces and places. All are cocoons of good quality.

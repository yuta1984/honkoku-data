When five silkworms enter their sleep (molting period), these worms do not eat mulberry leaves, while the remaining five have not yet entered their sleep and continue to eat mulberry voraciously. These latter ones enter their sleep a little later, and while waiting for this period, the first five wake up early and search around for mulberry leaves. However, one should observe until the latter five enter their full sleep and refrain from giving mulberry leaves while waiting. During this interval, it is not harmful to not provide leaves.

Now, when both the early and late groups enter their full sleep simultaneously, place them in one location and scatter mulberry leaves over all of them to rear them. With this method, the rest period of the second sleep will be well synchronized, and the care will become efficient. Even after this, if there are still early and late groups, the same method should be applied during the second sleep. By the third sleep, they will surely be synchronized. During this period, the insects' vitality is strong and they are still young, so

even with this method, they will become synchronized.

First, when entering sleep, they do not eat mulberry leaves and rest. Since the resting worms are underneath the scattered leaves, if one thoughtlessly scatters many leaves on top without any consideration, they will be steamed under the weight of the mulberry leaves, their color will deteriorate, and they will become particularly weak. Paying attention to such matters is what makes one an expert silkworm rearer.

If it is still difficult to distinguish between those entering sleep and those not yet entering sleep, one should gently place a branch of mulberry with leaves attached—choosing branches with soft twigs appropriate for the stage of the worms—directly over the worms. At that time, the resting worms will remain underneath as they are,

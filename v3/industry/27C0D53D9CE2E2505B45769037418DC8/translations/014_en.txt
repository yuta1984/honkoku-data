When five insects enter their sleeping phase, these insects do not eat mulberry leaves, while the remaining five have not yet entered the sleeping phase and continue to eat mulberry voraciously. This group enters the sleeping phase a little later, and while waiting for this interval, the first five wake up early and search around for mulberry leaves, but it is best to observe until the latter five completely enter their sleep and refrain from giving mulberry leaves while waiting. During this time, it is fine not to give them leaves.

Now, when the sleeping phases of the early and late groups align at once, place them in one location and scatter mulberry leaves over all of them for rearing. By doing this, the second sleep period will also align well for all, making care easier. Even after this, if there are still timing differences, the same method should be applied during the second sleep. By the third sleep, they will definitely be aligned. During this period, the insects' vital energy is strong and they are in their youthful stage, so

even with this method, they will align.

First, when entering the sleeping phase, they do not eat mulberry leaves and rest. The resting insects are therefore underneath the scattered leaves, but if one carelessly scatters many leaves on top without any consideration, they become stuffy under the weight of the mulberry leaves, their color deteriorates, and they become particularly weak. Paying attention to such matters is what makes an expert silkworm rearer.

If it is still difficult to distinguish between those entering sleep and those not, one should take a mulberry branch with leaves attached, choosing one with soft twigs appropriate for the size of the insects, and gently place the entire branch over the insects. At that time, the resting insects will remain underneath,

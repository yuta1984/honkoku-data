　　　On the Beginning of Sericulture in Japan
When we inquire into the origins of sericulture in our country, Amaterasu Omikami, while residing in the heavens above, said: "I hear that there is a deity called Ukemochi-no-kami in Ashihara-no-nakatsu-kuni (the Central Land of Reed Plains). You, Tsukuyomi-no-mikoto, should go and see." Tsukuyomi-no-mikoto received the imperial command and descended, having already arrived at Ukemochi-no-kami's place. Ukemochi-no-kami turned her head toward the land, and rice came forth from her mouth. When she faced the ocean, broad-finned and narrow-finned fish also came forth from her mouth. When she faced the mountains, creatures with coarse fur and soft fur also came forth from her mouth.

And so forth. 《The above is taken from the essential points of the Age of Gods chapter. This chapter uses human affairs to clarify creation. The reverence for the unity of heaven, humanity, and the divine teaching is beyond measure》

Thus the way of sericulture already began in the age of the gods. Wakamusubi-no-kami taught the way of raising silkworms, and Ukemochi-no-kami created cocoons, and thus began the way of drawing silk thread. That silkworms grew on the eyebrows means that cocoons resemble silkworm cocoons, which is why it is expressed this way. Seeing silkworms produce thread from their mouths, the way of silk reeling also began. Also, Wakahirume-no-mikoto resided in the Imhata-dono (Sacred Weaving Hall) and presided over the divine garments. Therefore, this deity is revered as the protective deity of all thread, cotton, and clothing. Also, the divine

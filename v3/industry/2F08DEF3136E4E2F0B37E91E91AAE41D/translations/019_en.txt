The fishermen helped the princess and sent her back to the original capital. The consort became very angry and ordered her retainers to dig deep in the palace garden and bury the princess alive. However, afterward a bright light shone from within the earth, which seemed strange, so the king had it dug up and saw that the princess was still unharmed. So again she was placed in a hollow boat made of mulberry wood and set adrift on the great sea. However, this boat drifted to Toyoura Harbor in Hitachi Province, Japan. The coastal people rescued and cared for her, but before long the princess passed away, and her spirit transformed into silkworms. For this reason, the first dormancy of silkworms is called "lion's rest," the second dormancy "hawk's rest," the third "boat's rest," and the fourth "garden's rest" - these names were given to model the four trials that the princess experienced in Tenjiku.

Seeds from good butterflies command high prices, while seeds from bad butterflies should be priced low. Moreover, the color of seeds reflects the vital energy of that particular soil appearing in the seeds. When raised on mulberry from red soil, the seeds become somewhat reddish in color, and when raised on mulberry from black soil, the seeds take on a somewhat blackish tint.

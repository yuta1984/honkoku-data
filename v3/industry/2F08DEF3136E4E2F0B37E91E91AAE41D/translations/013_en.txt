After removing impurities, they dry the eggs and warm them, then construct silkworm rooms and wait for the silkworms to hatch. When the time comes, they have soft mulberry leaves without moisture gathered from the east and make preparations. Before the silkworms sleep, mulberry leaves are strictly provided, and when they wake, they are gently nourished. When the silkworms appear to be dormant, their form when looking up resembles a dragon gazing at the clouds, and when lying down, they resemble a crouching tiger. They curl their bodies into circles and remain quiet at night. When they receive the morning sun, they immediately show the vigor of ascending to heaven. When they are about to hide in cocoons, seats are made with brushwood and kindling, they are placed in warm silkworm rooms, and the evening sun's heat is blocked. Once they have all become cocoons, sacred sake is offered to the silkworm deity, and not only the household but even neighbors gather to celebrate. Wind is let into the silkworm rooms to dry the cocoons, and the silkworm mother finally arranges her hair and applies makeup, waiting for the cocoons to harden.

The Empress winds thread on round frames called "three basins" and teaches this craft to numerous court ladies including court ladies and palace women. From there down to the common women among the people, they raise silkworms during breaks from agricultural work and practice the handicrafts of weaving and sewing, so that even the elderly can wear silk and neither hunger nor suffer from cold, entirely due to this Way.

On the Origins of Sericulture in China

In China, it is said that silk thread was first made from silkworms during the time of Fuxi. Also, in the "Silkworm Classic" by the King of Huainan, it is recorded that Xiling-shi, the principal consort of the Yellow Emperor, personally gathered mulberry leaves and raised silkworms.

The Book of Rites, Monthly Ordinances states:
"In this month (the third month), command the field wardens not to cut down mulberry and zhe trees. When the turtle dove beats its wings and the hoopoe descends to the mulberry trees, prepare the curved stands and bamboo baskets (tools for sericulture). The empress and consorts purify themselves and personally face east to gather mulberry leaves. Prohibit women from adorning themselves, simplify women's work to encourage sericulture. When cocoons are formed and silk is extracted, evaluate their achievements and use them for ceremonial robes for suburban and ancestral temple rituals. There must never be any negligence."

This passage explains that in the third month, officials in charge of mountains, forests, and fields are ordered to restrict the cutting down of mulberry and zhe trees. Also, when doves

beat their wings, it indicates that the time for silkworms to emerge is near. The hoopoe, commonly called "chrysanthemum-crested bird," has feathers that look like beautiful woven fabric. When this bird roosts in mulberry trees, one should quickly prepare shelves for placing silkworms, or items like pine covers, straw mats, and straw.

Even in China, in ancient times, even the emperor's consorts would purify themselves and personally gather mulberry leaves to raise silkworms. During sericulture periods, women were forbidden from adorning themselves, and all other routine women's handicrafts were suspended to ensure complete dedication to the work. When cocoons formed, silk would be extracted, individual achievements evaluated, and appropriate rewards given to encourage them.

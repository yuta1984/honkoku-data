The prohibition of original silkworms (gen-san) is because when summer silkworms are raised, mulberry leaves are harvested twice a year, making it the third sprouting, which greatly damages and harms the mulberry trees, so summer silkworms are prohibited.
Currently, the white cocoon silkworms exclusively raised in Japan sleep four times and wake four times, taking approximately thirty-seven to thirty-eight days to forty-odd days to make cocoons. The silkworms have the hiragana character "i" (い) on their necks. There are also black-spotted silkworms, and silkworms that make yellow cocoons. These are called "kinko." There are also white ones called "kata-natsu" (half-summer)

spring silkworms that make cocoons in thirty-odd days. These have thin cocoon shells and weak silk. Moths emerge in ten-odd days. These are the parents of summer silkworms. Moths are extracted from these cocoons to obtain summer silkworm eggs, and when eggs are obtained from summer silkworms, the following spring produces eggs of white silkworms called "kata-natsu."
All cocoons have various shapes: long, short, round, angular, pointed, etc. After silkworms become cocoons, moths emerge at the fifth hour of morning after seventeen to eighteen days. Males fly while females remain bowed and quiet. These are sorted and allowed to mate.

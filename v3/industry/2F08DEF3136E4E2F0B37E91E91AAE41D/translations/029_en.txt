On not being negligent with silkworms

In a certain village, there was a person who placed silkworms above and lit a fire below, causing great damage in just about an hour. This is something one should keep in mind.

Long ago, a farmer in a certain place was sowing rice seeds in a seedbed when a friend came, and they sat on the ridge of the rice field to rest together. Unexpectedly, they got into a long conversation and stayed until after noon before parting. He then sowed the remaining rice seeds and went home. The rice seeds sown in the morning had good germination, but those sown in the afternoon had very poor germination.

This happened in the third month when rice seeds were soaked in water, then the seedbed was prepared, and those seeds were taken from the water and dried to an appropriate degree. At that time, all the rice seeds sprouted. They should have been sown in the field without missing this timing, but because the sprouted rice seeds were left on the field ridge and exposed to the sun, all the young sprouts were damaged, resulting in a great crop failure that year.

Moreover, silkworms are living creatures that eat, so there can be changes even in a short time. From the day of the first cleaning, even with relatives and family members, during the period of raising silkworms, they should mutually excuse themselves from neglecting social visits

and handle them carefully without any negligence. Since it is only a duty of about forty to fifty days, one should devote oneself day and night to raising them.

The Monthly Ordinances in the Book of Rites states: "Prohibit women from adorning themselves, reduce female servants to encourage silkworm work." This expresses the same sentiment.

However, foolish people gather in one place, waste time in meaningless long conversations, and then suddenly become flustered

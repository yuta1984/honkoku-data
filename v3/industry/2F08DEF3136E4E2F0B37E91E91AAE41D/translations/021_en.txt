Regarding Taboos and Storage Methods for Silkworm Seeds

After obtaining seeds, they should be placed in paper bags and kept from retaining moisture, then suspended in a cool place from summer until the following spring. For seeds, oil residue, salt, tobacco and similar substances, iron objects, tea, hemp seeds, and camphor are highly toxic. Also, they should not be hung on walls. Wrapping them in mosquito nets or summer garments is very bad. Seeds hung above oil lamps are said not to hatch silkworms. Generally, they must not be placed near foul-smelling things. Placing them in sunny locations or near fires is also bad. All bad odors should be avoided.

Regarding Soaking Seeds in Cold Water

Soaking seeds in cold water is primarily to remove toxic influences. Another theory states that weak eggs will not hatch and only those with strong nature will emerge, thus making the silkworms' vitality stronger. It is also said that damage is less during north winds in May of the following year. In some regions, there are countries that do not soak them. When soaking in water, they should be placed in a large basin filled with clean water. {{Some regions soak them for 30 days during the cold season, while others soak them for one night at Setsubun (early February)}} On mornings with strong cold, the seeds become trapped in ice. At such times, they should be removed around the ninth hour of the day (around noon) when the weather is favorable. They should be hung on poles and dried in the shade.

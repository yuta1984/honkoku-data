By around October, many roots will emerge from where the wounded young shoots were buried. When buried without wounding, root emergence is slow. This is the secret of layering. The following spring, dig up the roots and separate them one by one like bell-shaped cuttings, then transplant them elsewhere. Manure should be gradually added to these. This is a method by which one branch can become eight or nine plants.

On Insect Expulsion and Removing Diseases from Mulberry

When leaves grow thick in spring, a red-colored disease sometimes affects the leaves. This disease has different names in different regions; in the Chugoku region it is called "sase." If this disease appears, it should be quickly swept away with a pole. If left as is, it will increase later and become highly toxic to silkworms. There is also a white insect called mulberry lice that appears in large numbers and damages mulberry leaves. This should also be swept away as described above. Generally, for land where such diseases occur, it is said that placing soot or alkaline substances like buckwheat hulls around the mulberry roots will reduce disease. During the early feeding period of spring silkworms, many insects called measuring worms appear on mulberry trees

Regarding insect expulsion, the Nihon Shoki states that "Ōnamuchi-no-mikoto and Sukunahikona-no-mikoto joined forces to govern the realm, established methods for curing diseases, and created prohibition and exorcism laws to ward off disasters from birds, beasts, and insects." This suggests it is a custom from the age of the gods. Chinese texts also mention performing insect expulsion on the day of Risshū (beginning of summer), so this practice may exist in foreign countries as well.

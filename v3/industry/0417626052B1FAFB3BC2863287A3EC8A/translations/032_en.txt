　should be pulled out. Also, female plants have dense branches and even when mature, appear
　somehow delicate. Male plants have good tree form but their branches are
　spaced far apart, with few flowers, and are damaged by wind and rain. For seed
　storage methods, dry them well and remove the husks, put the seeds in straw bags, place them in locations where moisture cannot reach
　them, and dry them occasionally on sunny days.
One: The planting season should be around the 88th night (early May), following
　the seasonal conditions of that place and year, sowing as early as possible. Set approximately two kan-me
　(about 7.5 kg) per tan (about 0.1 hectare), soak seeds in salt water, sprinkle with ash and knead together, then scatter the seeds
　evenly when they become separated grain by grain.
　Seed planting should be shallow with light tramping. If too deep,
　it's bad during long rains.
One: As for soil, rice fields, dry fields, or any kind of land is acceptable. For soil with strong clay content,
　it's good to add river sand or ditch mud in furrows. Sandy soil is preferred. New

　rice fields are very good. Places where wind blows through and with good sun exposure are
　excellent. Deep wetlands or places without convenient water access during droughts are difficult to
　cultivate.
One: For soil preparation methods, when planning to grow cotton next year, work the land three
　shaku seven to eight sun (about 1.1-1.2 meters) from winter, perform frequent middle cultivation, make ridge
　widths three shaku five to six sun (about 1.0-1.1 meters), and tend to ensure there are no
　weeds at all. For fertilizer, use human waste as base fertilizer for sandy soil, night soil for clay-heavy soil,
　and besides that, pile up ash or various refuse in sunny places, occasionally
　turning it over and letting it steam and rot, then finely break it down and apply abundantly to any soil.
　Also, it's good to place ash on top after sowing.
　Furthermore, apply the first fertilizer two to three days after hangesho (around July 2nd), then continue
　through the third fertilizer application - this fertilization schedule is crucial for proper care. Oral tradition.
One: For fertilizers, dilute liquid fertilizer or dried sardines are good for sandy soil. For clay soil, oil cake

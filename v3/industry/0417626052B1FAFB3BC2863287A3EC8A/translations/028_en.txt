　Pour five shō per plant. If using well water, remove the coldness from the water slightly
　before pouring. Do not pour during rain. Of course, pouring
　multiple times is bad. Frost falls and fruit forms.
One: First level the field deeply and make ridges. Ridge height should be about four sun. When sowing seeds,
　sow thicker than when sowing soybeans and such. Make the first ridge,
　then sow seeds, cover with soil, and make the next sowing ridge. Proceeding step by step
　to the left, the field becomes level.
One: Hemp fertilizers are stable manure, dried manure, ash, and human waste. Especially true soil in superior rice fields
　is considered good. During continued clear weather, land so hard that a hoe cannot penetrate
　is good.
One: When growth reaches about two sun five bu, if too thick, thin them out.
　Especially thick growth is good.
One: Immediately after thinning, cultivation should be done. Using a curved

　hoe like those for digging potatoes, scraping the space between ridges toward oneself causes small soil to gather at the base of the hemp plants.
　As described above, this is convenient for the work. When sowing, there are about three days considered good for hemp sowing, with the middle day being best.
One: As described above, after growing, around the seventh day after the beginning of the summer solstice period, pull them out by the roots. Pull six to seven or
　about ten plants at once. Especially pull according to the size of the hemp plants.
　After pulling, place them in a different field, then later remove the tip leaves
　and cut the roots. Especially cut the roots at the boundary
　of the roots at ground level. At this time, measure with a ruler and
　cut. Especially if superior and of good quality, about six shaku five sun, or depending on location, up to seven shaku
　five sun. However, when cutting, keep the lengths roughly uniform.
　There is especially a hemp-cutting sickle, which is a small sickle about five sun smaller than regular sickles.
One: Bundle the cut hemp into bundles of about one shaku five sun. Especially tie with rope and
　from the next day, dry depending on the weather. Dry directly on the ground

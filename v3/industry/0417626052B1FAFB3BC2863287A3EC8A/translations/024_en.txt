1. The name "authentic gold" is called "three strands" because it is about the thickness of three gold thread strands, hence the name.
1. The foil placed on paper has a width of two shaku three sun by curved measure, and approximately one shaku in length.
1. The method of manufacturing gold thread: Apply glue to the four edges of gampi paper and attach it to a board with floating tension. Apply glue over this twice, and after drying, remove from the board and polish with ivory. Then apply lacquer over it and place gold foil on top. The gold foil should be pressed down with silk floss. Also apply lacquer over the foil and cut it up. This is called flat gold thread. What is made by twisting the aforementioned flat gold onto madder cotton thread or hemp thread with a spindle is called round gold thread. The method of cutting flat gold thread is the same as cutting tobacco. There is oral teaching for this.

Diagram of Spinning Wheel
　Front view
　　Diameter three shaku　one sun five bu　one shaku five sun

　　With this wheel, 720 twists are applied 
　　per two shaku of thread. Therefore, using 
　　this proportional measurement, when applying 
　　strong twist, if the opposite two-sun wheel is 
　　made thicker, the thread twist becomes shallow; 
　　if the opposite small wheel is made thinner, 
　　　　　　　　　the thread twist becomes strong.
　　　　　　　　　　There is oral teaching for this.

　　Here, since the wheel's pulley cord expands and 
　　contracts with fair and rainy weather, it should be 
　　rigged to move freely left and right.

Pay careful attention and quickly scrub it off with a straw brush. If you do this, you can avoid that worry.

1. Mulberry trees have different varieties. "Takasuke" has wood that is slightly bluish-white, with buds sprouting closely together, small at first but later becoming large leaves that are hard and tough. Therefore, for the third feeding, if you use older leaves first, the silk will have good weight. "Akagi" has red-colored wood and is an early variety. "Tsuruda" has buds sprouting slightly closer together than Takasuke, with wood having a slight reddish tint, and is an early variety. "Yanagida" has buds sprouting far apart, grows upright quickly, and the wood color is slightly blackish-red. "Kobata" has wood that is slightly blue in color, and when planted at the same time as other mulberry varieties, it grows thick quickly. Because the leaves are soft, silkworms quickly spin silk and make cocoons with good luster, but the weight is insufficient, making it unsuitable. You should select and plant these five varieties. There is also a mulberry seedling called "Kannon jikishoku." This is grown by sowing seeds and transplanting seedlings the following year. The roots do not become thick taproots; these are mulberry

seedlings grown by burying mulberry seeds in the field. While they may seem good at first, they do not last many years and do not bear fruit well, so they are not suitable. Mulberry trees that grow naturally in mountains or fields have hard leaves, which is good. When the trees grow thick and the bud sprouting is poor, you should cut from the middle section of the tree and let new buds sprout for use.

1. For mulberry trees, if you do not cut down all remaining mulberry growth before Hange (the 11th day after the summer solstice), new shoots will not emerge the following year and the mulberry will perform very poorly.

1. In mulberry fields, fertilize and cultivate once during spring, once in summer, and once in autumn - three times per year. Tie up the new shoots with straw and leave them standing. This is to prevent the spring buds from being damaged by frost. The following spring, when you determine that frost will not fall, remove the straw and let the branches spread freely. If you do not do this and frost occurs, the mulberry buds will die and second-generation young buds will emerge. During this time, the silkworms grow large, and if this does not align with the timing of mulberry leaf availability, this timing judgment is crucial.

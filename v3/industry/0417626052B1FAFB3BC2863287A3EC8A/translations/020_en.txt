　　Method of Twisting Silk Thread
1. The thread taken from silkworms is made into shimada (bundled silk). The method is to insert thin bamboo or wooden sticks, even iron rods, into both ends, hold them down with the feet, tie the stick on the hand side with other thread, turn it over and again step on the stick with the foot, and tie the hand side. When both upper and lower parts are tied in the same manner, turn the thread over again from the middle, insert the stick and tie it short. The upper part becomes one knot, the lower part becomes two knots. This is called shimada knot. Next, remove the stick, and tie the upper and lower parts of what has become like a skein. This is called raw silk thread, or just silk thread.

1. Transfer the raw silk thread to a tonbou (bobbin), wind it repeatedly onto a small spool, and determine the appropriate amount of whatever number of threads should be combined, then align them together. However, "hiki-soroe" (aligning) means gathering many threads together. When aligning, place the spool upright facing away, stretch bamboo high above it, and onto that

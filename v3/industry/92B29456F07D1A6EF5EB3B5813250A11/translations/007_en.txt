1. When thirty to forty silkworms showing signs of pupation are visible, set up the post-pupation area. The method of setting up the area is to spread bran thinly until the gaps in the straw tray are covered. Set up the area thinly, give mulberry thinly and frequently, and when about one-fourth of the awakening silkworms are visible, apply stopping mulberry so they naturally hide in the mulberry and pupate.

1. Do not give mulberry until the stopping mulberry; on hot days for one day

　and a half, on cold days rest the mulberry for about two days.
　　However, even when resting the mulberry, there will still be silkworms that have not yet pupated.
　　For those, apply stopping mulberry, immediately pick them up and transfer them to a separate
　　straw tray, give them mulberry and let them pupate.

1. After they all awaken and mulberry is applied, if mulberry is given twice, the awakening aftermath area must be set up. From this time onward, do not spread bran but raise them directly on the straw tray.

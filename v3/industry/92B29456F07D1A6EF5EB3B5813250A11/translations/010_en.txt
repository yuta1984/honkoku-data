1. Before evening, apply leaf mulberry again, and do not
　touch them until the next morning.
　　However, any that have climbed up to the edge of the straw trays during the night should all be picked up

　　climbed up and put them into the mabuthi (cocoon frames). For the rest,
　　apply leaves and leave them.

　and take up those ready for mounting. Each time you take them up, do it
　in this manner.
　　However, first take all those that have climbed up initially, then tend
　　to the remaining areas. After taking them up, if that straw tray
　　becomes sparse, gather them from other straw trays
　　to maintain an appropriate density.
1. Do not take young ones that are climbing up. The cocoons will be thin and silk threads will not emerge properly.

"Treatise on Warm Epidemic Diseases" in two volumes, with "Supplement" in one volume (popular edition)
Written by Wu Youxing of the Ming dynasty. Youxing's courtesy name was Youke, a native of Zhenze. This book was completed in the Chongzhen Renwu year (1642). He theorized that irregular qi of the four seasons develops into warm epidemics, and that while this disease resembles typhoid fever, it is completely different from it. Since ancient texts could not distinguish between them, he wrote this treatise to elucidate the matter. Generally speaking, he argued as follows: Typhoid fever enters through the hair pores, affects the meridian networks, and progresses from exterior to interior, thus having six patterns of meridian transmission, proceeding from yang to yin, gradually deepening. Epidemic diseases enter through the mouth and nose, lie dormant in the membrane source, with the pathogenic qi existing in a space that is neither exterior nor interior, and having nine patterns of transmission and transformation, sometimes manifesting in the exterior or penetrating to the interior, each forming distinct diseases. There are cases that manifest only in the exterior without entering the interior, and cases that manifest in the exterior and then manifest in the exterior again.

Postface to "Notes on the Treatise on Warm Epidemic Diseases"

When I was around twenty years old, I read the "Treatise on Warm Epidemic Diseases" together with a friend, and as we progressed through our reading, I consulted various books and made annotations in the upper margins. In the year Tenpo Kinoto-U (1844), I lectured on this book again and compiled it into a small booklet for the convenience of lectures and study. However, my textual research is still like a few grains of rice in a great storehouse - incomplete, mentioning one thing while omitting a hundred others. I would be most grateful if readers would correct errors and supplement omissions. Written by Tsubakitei Yamada Narihiro.

I drafted this book in Tenpo Kinoto-U year, but the corrections and deletions were so chaotic that it was almost unreadable. This year, in Bunkyu Mizunoto-I (1863), Ozu domain physician Bairin Genrui and Shirakawa domain physician Noritsuke Harumi collated it item by item against the original text, and afterwards the format became somewhat presentable. However, how could this small booklet be called a scholarly work? But not wanting to waste the diligence of these two men, I have had it bound again into a booklet and placed it on the bookshelf. Written again by Tsubakitei.

Add qianghuo and saposhnikovia to Minor Bupleurum Decoction, and only then does it become appropriate for the pattern. Zang Luxi said: In the section about treating the interior first and then the exterior, it says that after purging removes the interior pattern, within two or three days, fever develops again, etc. At this time, if the pulse is surging, rapid, and also long and large, yang brightness pattern appears, so White Tiger Decoction can indeed be used. If, as mentioned, there is conversely added headache, body pain, and floating pulse, this is a greater yang pattern, and White Tiger Decoction is greatly unsuitable. Moreover, for this pattern after purging, there are also cases where qi and blood become deficient, so it is better to use Minor Bupleurum Decoction with modifications as this is more stable. <<Classified Compilation Volume 2 <<9 Back>>>>

The Zhaji (Notes) states: In Xunzi's chapter on Honor and Disgrace: "Filial piety, fraternal duty, sincerity, and honesty; qu-lu swift strength; to earnestly compare their endeavors without daring to be lazy or arrogant - this is how common people obtain warm clothing and sufficient food, achieve longevity, and avoid punishment and execution." Yang Liang's commentary states: "Qu" is the same as "gou" (restrain), "gou-lu" means self-restraint and discipline. "Swift strength" means working quickly and vigorously. Since the chapter on the Way of Rulers contains the phrase "sincere and honest gou-lu," it is said that "qu" is the same as "gou." However, in Huainanzi's chapter on Governing Techniques: "In human nature, nothing is more precious than benevolence, nothing more urgent than wisdom. These two are fundamental, and when added with courage, strength, eloquence, wisdom, swiftness, urgency, and qu-lu" - then qu-lu is like what people today call "labor-lu" (toil). To interpret it merely as restraint is incorrect. The Taizhuan Training also says "qu-lu swift strength," writing it as "qu" is correct. "Lu" should be written as "lu" (record), or perhaps ancient people used it interchangeably due to similar pronunciation. In the chapter on the Way of Rulers, taking "sincere and honest gou-lu" as the material for officials and clerks should properly be interpreted as diligent labor.

Regarding "vital qi from within passes through membrane source to reach the surface": Liu Songfeng suggests changing "vital" to "evil," saying the character "vital" is inappropriate. However, "vital qi" refers to interior qi. After the Dayuan Drink formula it states: "Evil qi entrenches itself in the membrane source, separating interior and exterior, so surface qi cannot penetrate inward and interior qi cannot reach outward."

Regarding "battle sweats": The section on battle sweats in this volume should be consulted.

Regarding "Initial onset of warm epidemic" (in the categorical volume 2, written as "Treatment methods for initial onset of warm epidemic").

Regarding "miasmatic qi of Lingnan": The Medical Surplus states: According to Chaoyuan, "miasma of Lingnan is like cold damage north of the mountains." The Wai Tai quotes Beijí: "Lingnan generally calls it miasma, while north of the Yangtze it is generally termed malaria. This is due to different regional dialects, not because they are different diseases." According to the Book of Later Han, Biography of Ma Yuan: "Military officers experienced miasmatic epidemics." Also in Song Jun's biography: "When Ma Yuan died in the army, many soldiers..."

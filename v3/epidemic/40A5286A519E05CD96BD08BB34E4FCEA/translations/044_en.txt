One type where the entire tongue surface is black but without coating《13 Back》　Ye Tianshi said, when the tongue has no coating but has
　something like soot faintly present, one must be careful not to disregard it. If there is thirst, vexing heat, and dryness,
　this indicates chronic stomach dryness, and one must not attack it but should benefit the stomach with sweet and cold medicines. If there is no thirst and the limbs are cold
　and moist, this involves yin disease and one should support the center with sweet and warm medicines. Why is this so? Because it manifests externally but
　there is nothing internally.
Cracked tongue《14 Front》　Liu Songfeng said, generally cracked tongues are difficult to heal completely, and even when the disease is cured, ultimately
　traces cannot be eliminated.　
Short tongue《14 Front》　Upon examination, this belongs to difficult-to-treat cases, as explained in Ye Tianshi's discussion above.

Frequent deep sighing《15 Back》　Liu Songfeng said, what the ancients called "long deep sighs" refers precisely to
　this, namely the sound of sighing, long exhalation of breath. Because qi is not flowing smoothly, only after sighing once
　does one begin to feel relaxed and loose. The interpretation here as breathing being unfavorable and drawing qi downward is still not very
　precise or accurate.

There are cases that manifest only in the interior without appearing in the exterior, cases that manifest in the interior and then manifest in the interior again, cases where the disease transmits separately to both exterior and interior, cases where it transmits separately to exterior and interior and then transmits separately again, cases where the exterior predominates over the interior, cases that first manifest in the exterior and then enter the interior, and cases that first enter the interior and then manifest in the exterior. Among these, there are eleven matters that are contrary to typhoid fever, and there are also variant patterns and combined patterns that differ in various ways. [Wu Youxing] wrote treatises and formulated prescriptions for all of these, distinguishing them one by one. Those that are clearly and easily observable have pulses that are neither hidden nor sunken, becoming apparent only when taken with moderate pressure. The tongue invariably has coating—initially white, becoming yellow when severe, and turning black with thorny projections when extremely severe. His assertion that "among hundreds of epidemic cases, there happens to be only one typhoid case, and among hundreds of typhoid cases, there happens to be only one yin pattern case" inevitably goes too far in correcting the bias. However, ancient physicians treated epidemic diseases as miscellaneous disorders, and medical texts often included them only as appendices without establishing specialized categories. Moreover, they sometimes misinterpreted the passage in the Suwen that "injury by cold in winter inevitably causes warm disease in spring" and applied treatments recklessly. When major epidemics occurred in Southern and Northern Zhili, Shandong, and Zhejiang in the Chongzhen Xinsi year (1641), Youxing found that treating them with typhoid methods was ineffective. He therefore investigated the disease sources, consulted and examined medical case records, and wrote this book. For the first time, epidemic diseases as a clinical entity had reliable standards to follow, which can truly be said to have benefited the world. The book is not very systematically organized and seems to have been composed like random notes and records, but we preserve its original form for now. In the lower volume, the section on relapse due to overexertion and dietary indiscretion includes the "Spirit-Calming Blood-Nourishing Decoction," and the section on pediatric seasonal epidemics includes the "Supreme Ultimate Pill," but both have prescriptions without clinical patterns described. Also, the section on combined epidemic dysentery has records but no written descriptions. Therefore, these were separately added as a supplement at the end. Additionally, the chapters "Rectification of Names," "Corrections of Errors in Typhoid Examples," and "Corrections of Errors in Various Schools' Epidemic Theories" were not included in the original table of contents. These were presumably added after the book's completion. Now they have also been included together as one volume, making it a complete work.

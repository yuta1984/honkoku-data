"In cases where there are indications for purgation, etc.": Liu Songfeng said, "This sentence should be given serious consideration. If there are indications for purgation, then one may give a small amount for gentle purgation. If there are no indications for purgation, one absolutely must not give Chengqi Decoction."

Liu Songfeng said: "Rash eruption is generally caused by pathogenic toxins that do not resolve and remain lodged in the blood aspect. There are cases where one should induce sweating but doesn't, so exterior pathogens don't resolve. There are cases where one should purge but doesn't, so interior pathogens don't resolve. There are cases where one should clear heat but doesn't, so extreme heat doesn't resolve. There are cases where epidemic qi accumulates thickly and accumulated toxins don't resolve. There are cases where warming and tonifying medicines are mistakenly used, causing yang hyperactivity that doesn't resolve. There are cases where cold-cool medicines are taken excessively, causing yin congealment that doesn't resolve. There are cases where one should tonify but doesn't, so weakness prevents resolution. Since the causes of disease are not singular, the therapeutic methods are also numerous. In treating rashes in this chapter, there is only one Chengqi formula - how could this alone encompass all the variations? As for Juban Decoction, this is merely a formula to remedy damage from excessive purgation, and is definitely not a proper formula for treating rashes. To mention one while abandoning a hundred - how negligent this is!"

Repeated Purgation Causing Loss of Yin

After Resolution, One Should Nourish Yin and Avoid Administering the Three Herbs (Ginseng, Atractylodes)

After sudden resolution, residual flames still remain and yin-blood has not yet recovered - greatly avoid ginseng, astragalus, and white atractylodes:
Master Sun said: "Generally, for those who recover from illness by taking purgative decoctions, afterwards one must carefully avoid taking tonifying decoctions. If one has just recovered and qi-strength has not yet greatly returned to normal, one should simply observe quietly. If medicines must be taken, they should be balanced with neutral medicines."

Zhu Fengyi discussed: "After purgation, one must carefully avoid taking tonifying medicines. Master Sun said: 'After taking Great Chengqi Decoction and obtaining purgation with recovery, one must carefully avoid taking tonifying medicines. When heat qi receives tonification and reforms, requiring purgation again, this causes severe exhaustion. One should observe quietly and nourish peacefully.'"

Tao Jie'an said: "Generally in treating cold damage, if after sweating and purgation, one must not immediately use major tonifying medicines like ginseng and astragalus."

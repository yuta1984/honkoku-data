Regarding "spreading influence": The Zuo Zhuan, year 23 of Duke Xi states: "Feathers, fur, teeth, and leather are produced from the ruler's land. That which spreads to the state of Jin is the ruler's surplus."

Regarding the stomach transferring heat to the qi aspect of the lower burner, causing urination difficulties and heat binding in the bladder: The urination section of this volume states: "When heat reaches the bladder, urine becomes red in color. When pathogen reaches the bladder and interferes with the qi aspect, urine becomes sticky and turbid." It also states: "When heat reaches the bladder, the pathogen is in the stomach, and stomach heat scorches the bladder in the lower burner. There is only heat without pathogen, merely causing the urine to become red in color. The treatment focuses on the stomach. When pathogen reaches the bladder, this means epidemic pathogen has distributed to the lower burner, and the bladder actually contains pathogen, not limited to heat alone. Coming from the stomach system, treatment focuses on the stomach while also treating the bladder. If treating the bladder alone, stomach qi will take advantage of the momentum and crowd into the bladder, which is not the proper treatment. If there is no pathogen in the intestines and stomach, but only urgent and frequent urination, or white discharge like horse urine, the treatment focuses on the bladder. Zhuling Decoction is appropriate. This is suitable for cases where pathogen interferes with the qi aspect."

Regarding transferring heat to the blood aspect of the lower burner, causing blood stasis in the bladder and lower abdominal hardness and fullness: The urination section also states: "When pathogen interferes with the blood aspect, there will be blood in urine and blood stasis." Also in the Taoren Decoction formula: "Suitable for cases where pathogen interferes with the blood aspect. Lower abdominal pain, hard and painful when pressed, normal urination - this indicates blood stasis. Add 3 qian of rhubarb. In severe cases, use Didang Decoction."

Regarding dan malaria (heat-type malaria): The Malaria Theory states: "Those with only heat but no chills have yin qi cut off first, and yang qi manifesting alone, resulting in shortness of breath and vexation, hot hands and feet with desire to vomit. This is called dan malaria. Also, having only heat without chills means qi is stored internally in the heart and lodged externally between the flesh, causing people to waste away and lose flesh. Therefore it is named dan malaria." Wang Bing said: "Dan means heat." For detailed malaria symptoms, see the epidemic malaria section in the lower volume. For heat entering the blood chamber, see the women's epidemic section in the lower volume in detail.

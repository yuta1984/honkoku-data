cold but instead becomes severely warm, and people receive this damp pestilential qi, which is called "winter warmth." This unseasonable and abnormal qi enters through the nose, and since the skin and body hair cannot yet receive the evil, there is no sweating. Also, the study of the Five Spirits Pills for Epidemic Malaria and Nose-Blocking Method states: "Since epidemic qi is formless and enters through the nose, it is therefore also blocked at the nose." This epidemic qi of winter plague also enters through the nose. Also, the study of Taiwu Divine Atractylodes Powder states: "Mountain mist miasmatic qi refers to the qi of barrier fog, damp earth, and mounded hills in mountain valleys. Damp qi steams up and enters through the nose, transmitted and transformed through breathing, with evil and righteous qi contending." Also, the Complete Book of Medicine states: "Diseases of miasmatic qi occur in the southeast where rain is heavy, mountains are steep, and water is bad, with warm putrid heat. In spring and autumn seasons, one is externally affected by fog poison, causing chills and fever, chest fullness, and poor appetite. This poison enters through mouth and nose." This miasmatic qi enters through mouth and nose. The Guang Notes state: "Among the three yang syndromes of cold damage and epidemic warmth, many often carry yang brightness syndrome because the hand yang brightness meridian

belongs to the large intestine and forms an exterior-interior relationship with the lungs, both opening their orifices at the mouth. Since all evil qi enters through mouth and nose, those combining with yang brightness syndrome are particularly numerous. This yang brightness disease enters through mouth and nose." Zhang Xiju's Direct Explanation of Cold Damage states: "Cholera does not enter through the exterior or involve the physical layers; great evil enters through mouth and nose and directly strikes the interior, making the disease most urgent. Also: 'Sha is the improper qi between heaven and earth, with damp heat steaming and entering through mouth and nose, causing abdominal cramping pain without vomiting or diarrhea—what is commonly called intestinal cramping sha.'" This cholera and sha both enter through mouth and nose. Shen Mingzong's Commentary on the Golden Coffer states: "The syndrome of being struck by evil, commonly called intestinal cramping sha, is when foul, filthy, evil, and poisonous qi directly enters the organs and bowels of heart, chest, intestines, and stomach through mouth and nose." This being struck by evil enters through mouth and nose. What is recorded in various books is already like this, and people merely know from Wu Youke's words that epidemic warmth [enters] through mouth and nose

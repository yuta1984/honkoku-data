When fever occurs and smallpox erupts, if one is exposed to wind-cold, foul air, or impure qi, the smallpox that is about to emerge becomes difficult to appear. If infection occurs after smallpox has already emerged, the eruptions become difficult to enlarge and do not form pus.

It must not be used carelessly. It kills people. One must be cautious.

First, regarding the two items saffron and theriac brought from Holland, many common people understand these as miraculous medicines for smallpox and use them. Saffron is called carthamus (hānhónghuā) and is recorded in materia medica texts. Its nature resembles safflower, with the function of activating blood, promoting blood circulation, and nourishing and supplementing blood. Therefore, it should be used for conditions of blood heat, dryness, blood stasis, and blood excess. Also, during women's smallpox...

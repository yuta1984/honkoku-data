Due to this (blood excess), the blood becomes stagnant and does not circulate, overflowing onto the skin and muscle tissue, causing eruptions to become intensely red and develop itching. Sometimes it causes the development of what are called han (spots), or sometimes it produces what are called cho (boils). Or the blood circulation becomes blocked, resulting in a condition called blood poisoning, where the eruptions become scorched and black, fail to suppurate, and eventually lead to a dangerous condition. However, for women who experience menstruation during smallpox, it may be used quite well. Also, for the condition called blood deficiency where the eruptions have pale redness, it may be used in small amounts. However, for those whose qi and blood are both deficient, it will have no effect unless Korean ginseng is used.

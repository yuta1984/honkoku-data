　　On Prohibiting Narwhal Horn《Annotation: Including Human Fish Bone and Human Tooth Powder》
According to Fengzi's Secret Records: When qi and blood are weak, there is no power to control smallpox toxin, and even though smallpox erupts,
there is no rising and swelling, no suppuration. However, mediocre doctors and common families generally prefer to use narwhal horn, inviting harm—

place it in hot water for a while, then give the clear liquid on top. Never use
excessively. For deficiency pattern patients, it must never be given. Also, in the Smallpox Heart Seal, human
teeth have extremely strong detoxification effects, so when used for weak smallpox patients, they will
inevitably develop ulcerative lesions and become difficult to treat. It says not to use carelessly. One should be cautious

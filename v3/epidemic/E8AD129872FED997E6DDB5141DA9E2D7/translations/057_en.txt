First, when unfavorable conditions are added during smallpox and by the eleventh or twelfth day it becomes increasingly dangerous, with pus still insufficient, or when the skin is thin and pus leaks without drying, or when the head and face become dry and black, or when both cheeks suffer from external peeling with skin flaking off and flesh becoming dry and black, or when hands and feet form blisters, or when body heat is like fire, or when there is restlessness and delirium, or when eating and drinking do not progress and mouth dryness does not cease, when the spirit is exhausted and cannot sleep, or when the eyes are closed and still lack the strength to open, or when foul odors fill the room and assault the nose, when the voice does not emerge and one is like a mute, or when bowel movements are loose and breathing becomes labored with phlegm and wheezing - for such patients, sake decoction must not be administered.

First, even on the twelfth, thirteenth, or fifteenth day, if there are even slight unfavorable symptoms, sake decoction must be postponed. Often one sees those who rush sake decoction and immediately turn to dire outcomes.

First, there is a historical origin to what common people call "sake decoction." Upon consideration, in ancient times, smallpox was regarded as a strange disease, and when someone suffered from it, they would be moved to fields and mountains, cut off from human settlements, with family and relatives severing communication, leaving fortune and misfortune to heaven. If they fortunately recovered, after fifty days the entire family and relatives would gather to give them a bath, bring them home, and hold a sake banquet to celebrate the end of the smallpox taboo period. The current sake decoction practice probably derives from this custom.

First, in the dialectal account of the Tsukushi priest, during the middle period there was a surgeon named Murakami something-or-other in Tsukushi province. His two children suffered from difficult smallpox - one had malodorous smallpox, the other had maggot smallpox, and their suffering accumulated day by day.

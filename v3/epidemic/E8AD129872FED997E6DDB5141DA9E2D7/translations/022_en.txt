Places where toxins have accumulated show dense clusters of smallpox eruptions, and these inevitably cause itching afterward. Mediocre doctors and ordinary households, not understanding the reason for this, mistakenly consider massage to be beneficial. From now on, this should be carefully avoided and prohibited.

　　Theory Against Taking the Pulse During Smallpox
Zhang Yinbin said: Human diseases can be diagnosed in detail through examining the pulse to understand their source, but smallpox alone differs from other diseases in that it arises from within and manifests externally. If the eruptions appear completely in one or two days, then on the third or fourth day the flesh swells, on the fifth or sixth day it rises like mountains, gradually forming pus, and when the scabs fall off, if the eruptions are dense, they become like old pine bark or like scattered chicken droppings before healing. Therefore, trying to take the pulse over the eruptions is like taking the pulse through a padded cloth jacket. For this reason, ancient physicians said that taking the pulse during smallpox is like scratching an itch through one's shoes.

There is what is called "peeled rabbit" - when the skin of the eruptions breaks and pus and blood flow, resembling a skinned rabbit. There are also cases where the scabs form thickly and when dry resemble earthworms covered in ash. Or there is "festering smallpox" where the scabs curl up and pus and blood fester and flow. Even if one attempts to take the pulse in the face of these symptoms, it would be impossible to understand the symptoms in detail. Moreover, since smallpox is a yin disease manifesting as yang, its pulse necessarily shows a yang pulse. If treatment is not administered based on the pulse, harm to human life would be minimal. For this reason, in my family's medical practice, we consider the lips, tongue, form, and color as primary, infer the timing, clarify internal and external symptoms, and use these as the rules for treatment. Those who discuss the pulse in relation to smallpox have not grasped the essential subtle principles. However, during fever and after scab formation, the pulse should be consulted.

　　Theory That Smallpox Has No Fatal Symptoms
The "Smallpox Key" states that "smallpox originally has no fatal symptoms." Among the thousands of smallpox patients I have examined, there are some who develop smallpox while still in their mother's womb and are born with it, some who develop smallpox in the birthing room, and some who develop smallpox within twenty-one days of birth.

When other diseases are added causing adverse reactions, it cannot be helped, but the harm caused by medicine to people should be avoided.

Li Renshan and Zhang Luyu have written about inoculating and transplanting smallpox. When I tested this on four or five children, those with few eruptions that heal naturally are similar to mild smallpox and later develop smallpox again.

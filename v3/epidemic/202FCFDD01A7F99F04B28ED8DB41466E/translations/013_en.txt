Similar beer should not be consumed.

No. 31: Avoid exposure to cold. The body should be kept at a consistent temperature throughout, taking care not to suddenly be exposed to cold. Contact of the abdomen and limbs with cold air should be particularly avoided. For this reason, those who frequently suffer from abdominal pain and diarrhea that follow from exposure to cold should wrap woolen belly bands around themselves to keep warm. Also, getting the feet wet or cold should be avoided. Furthermore, both the person's body and dwelling should be kept extremely clean, and the house should be opened appropriately every day to allow fresh air to circulate. It should also be wiped clean with clear water. However, this should not be done excessively either, as too much humidity would be harmful.

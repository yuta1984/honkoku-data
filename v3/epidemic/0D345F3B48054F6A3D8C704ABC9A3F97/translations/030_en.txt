was expected, but we are extremely mortified. In previous years too
such incidents occurred, and once again this matter was reported to Tsushima-dono,
who felt very sorry about it. As a result,
Ehara Soemon was ordered to become a masterless samurai (ronin) the other day. Furthermore,
so that retainers of the private domain would not commit such acts in the future,
strict orders were given down to the smallest details.
As stated above, his retainer came out to Nishimaru and reported this,
as conveyed by Minoda Sakuzaemon, so from our side as well, once again
we sent word to Sakuzaemon. That such incidents should not occur in the future
was appropriately ordered, and the matter of Soemon being ordered to become ronin
is truly pitiful, therefore we earnestly wish
for his pardon, as all the officials say, and this
should be negotiated with his retainer, we sent word.

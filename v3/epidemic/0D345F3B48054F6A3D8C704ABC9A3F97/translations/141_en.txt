　　Written petition
My private circumstances are extremely dire, and moreover my fief has become particularly desolate in recent years. I have been assigned excessive shortfalls in rice yields, and even when I try to make payments out of necessity, I cannot manage it. There are many outstanding debts, and frankly speaking, it has become difficult to maintain the family line. Regarding my elderly father, he has little time left to live and is in an extremely difficult situation, presenting a pitiful appearance.
[One line unclear]
This is my thinking. In particular, my father was granted a large stipend, but due to his advanced age, he cannot perform his current duties, and he cannot manage any household affairs, making our situation extremely difficult. Given the current circumstances, it is most painful to petition for such matters, but when my father was a masterless samurai, he received a sustenance allowance from the domain. If even a portion of this could be granted to my elderly father through your compassion, we could endure this extremely difficult situation, for which I would be most grateful. Recently I have felt this to be presumptuous, but at this time I deeply and repeatedly request that care be provided.

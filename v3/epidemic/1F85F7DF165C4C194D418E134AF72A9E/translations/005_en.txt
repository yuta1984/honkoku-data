could not be found. From this recent epidemic, I have obtained from my teacher what should serve as guidance for ordinary households regarding smallpox, and have compiled in hiragana the methods of caring for smallpox patients. In the appendix, I have recorded even matters concerning measles and chickenpox (heinai), carved this into printing blocks, and hope that if people throughout the world, including maidservants, would regularly keep this at hand, it might serve as useful guidance.

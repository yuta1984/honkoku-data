The fever of measles is similar to typhoid fever and is severe. There is only frequent coughing, the voice becomes hoarse and does not come out, the throat swells and hurts, the mouth becomes dry and the throat is parched, drinking hot water endlessly. The fever lasts for one day, and rashes appear everywhere on the skin of the body without leaving any space, looking like marks from flea or mosquito bites, or like millet grains. After the fever subsides in half a day, one day, or one and a half to two days, if the measles subside, this is a good and normal progression. When the measles are about to emerge, if you rely on a good physician and have the patient take medicine, the poison will easily come out through sweat. During the fever, it is strictly forbidden to expose oneself to wind and cold from outside, and to eat cold or raw foods inside. Since the patient has internal heat, they prefer raw and cold foods,

but breaking this prohibition and cooling from inside and outside prevents the measles from emerging and transforms it into a malignant condition. One should simply wear thick clothing and promote sweating for protection. When the measles are emerging, the inside of the throat swells and it becomes difficult to swallow food and drink. This is an extremely urgent condition. Do not panic and needle the throat unnecessarily. This is because the fire poison of measles is vigorous. Use medicines that resolve heat, decoct them in water and take them. Or store cold water or snow from winter and take it. The effect is wonderful. When the fever of measles is vigorous, if one eats too much cold water, pears, tangerines, ripe persimmons, etc., there are cases where people die from diarrhea after the measles subside. No matter how thirsty one becomes, give hot water and do not let them drink cold things.

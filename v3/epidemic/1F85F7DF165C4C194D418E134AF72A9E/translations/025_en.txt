this should be prohibited. When measles emerge, there may originally be abdominal pain and diarrhea, or what is called "jiri" where bowel movements occur unconsciously, or there may be red and white dysentery combined. All of these are malignant conditions. One should urgently seek treatment from a good physician. When measles emerge, there is nausea and vomiting. In small children, they vomit milk.
However, once the measles have fully emerged, the vomiting will naturally stop.
There are also symptoms where vomiting does not stop even after full emergence, which is malignant. One should be cautious.
When measles emerge and the color is red, this is a good sign. Purple-black color indicates a fatal condition. Simply prioritize rest and care above all. In any case, one should avoid wind and cold. For mild cases, wait forty-nine days before lifting the prohibitions.

For severe cases, wait seventy-five days or one hundred days. In all cases, the prohibitions are the same as for smallpox.

　　Knowledge about chickenpox
Chickenpox is also called "heinai" and resembles smallpox, emerging easily and drying easily. When it first appears, it contains moisture and holds water, hence it is called chickenpox. It appears almost all over the body, and without waiting two or three days, within five or six days total, the sores become only watery pus and subside. The treatment and prohibitions are no different from smallpox and measles. Among these, smallpox occurs once in a lifetime, while chickenpox may occur two or three times. Smallpox arises from within the five organs, while measles and chickenpox arise only from the six bowels.

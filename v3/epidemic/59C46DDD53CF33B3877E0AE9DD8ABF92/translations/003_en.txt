　　　Measles verses
The coldness is the same, even measles under the eaves
The world shows compassion; when traveling, measles creates companions
For those distant from marriage, measles completes the role
Putting measles in one's pocket and bringing out the oar
Measles caught in the evening shower - how pitiful
Calling it an old pear, my child has measles matters
From measles came Shakyamuni and Daruma ■
Measles sufferers, Yoshiwara district becomes [unclear]
A caged bird, without measles cannot even show its eyes

[Right]
　　　　　　　　　　I respectfully state: My friend
Master Mayamako lost his father and became an orphan, serving his mother with devotion to heaven's way. His aesthetic sensibilities in elegant pursuits run deep, and his courtesy in friendship is profound - these qualities cannot be fully described here. This year he suffered from measles, and afterward was afflicted with beriberi, confined to his sickbed for some time. During this period, he occasionally composed kyōku verses in the yanagikaze style, totaling approximately one hundred and forty poems. He earnestly pressed me to select and transcribe these, but though I am fond of this art, my foolish and common mind cannot distinguish which are flowers or autumn leaves. However, since refusal would not be permitted, I write as I see fit and humbly accept your laughter.
　　At this time, Bunkyū 2, year of the dog, intercalary 8th month
　　Recorded beneath my window　　　Tamagawa

Putting measles in one's pocket and bringing out the oar
Measles caught in the evening shower - how pitiful
Calling it an old pear, my child performs measles
From measles, Shakyamuni and Daruma were abundantly created
Measles sufferers, Yoshiwara district becomes abalone
A caged bird, after measles cannot even show its eyes

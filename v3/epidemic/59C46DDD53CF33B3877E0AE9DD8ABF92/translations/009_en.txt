Even saying "come out a bit" is now too late, great tolerance
Apothecary with medicines like purgatives and purple root
When nobles suffer and cannot sleep, hammers are brought out

Making okoshi, plenty comes out, the young lady smiles
That doctor's family crest shows sparrows, father tells everyone
Thanks to you, we're thoroughly exhausted - gratitude to the doctor

Measles wearing kebiishi robes doesn't even die
The streets have only beta Teikuro
Only the chief guard, old people, mice and cats
Those who boil and set aside shellfish are all eaten by the shells

Is it finished? If it's the "oton-ton" sound, it's the second time
It's decided - the daughter's legs gave out after just once
In seventy-five days, just three or four more days, dear
Completely emaciated, Yoshiwara courtesans, the embankment collapses
At the mountain pass too difficult to cross, the bride rides a horse

does not have the same properties as dead bodies. As a test, if you take a heavy weight that a living person can lift and tie it to a dead person's hand, the skin and flesh will inevitably tear. For this reason, the mechanical force (mecha) of organic bodies is not the same as that of inorganic bodies, but rather transforms to assist the actions of vital functions. Therefore, this is also called "organic mechanical force" (Beweglichkeit mechanische Kraft). Hence, the binding of fibers, the propulsion of blood cells, the expansion of the heart, lungs, and blood vessels, the friction of gastric and intestinal folds, the liver and diaphragm compressing the stomach, and the propulsion of feces and urine through the intestines and urethra are naturally not the same as the actions of inorganic mechanical force. However, when this mechanical force becomes dominant and does not follow the transformations of vital force, blood may coagulate (cohesive force) and block blood vessels, or water may fall (gravity) and accumulate in various body cavities, or various orifices may experience narrowing, obstruction, and contraction (cohesive force), or various parts may develop swelling, curvature, bending, etc. (tensile force).

Chemical force (semi) also does not freely exercise the actions of lifeless nature in organic bodies, but rather transforms to carry out life operations. This is called "organic chemical force" (Beweglichkeit chemische Kraft). In the human body, it digests food and drink to produce blood, decomposes blood to create various organs and fluids, distributes oxygen into the blood through inhalation, and eliminates carbon and hydrogen through exhalation. All the separation, combination, gathering, dispersal, and metabolism of substances within the body follow different pathways from inorganic chemical force. Also, even with plants cultivated in the same field, the resources of soil properties, moisture, atmosphere, etc.

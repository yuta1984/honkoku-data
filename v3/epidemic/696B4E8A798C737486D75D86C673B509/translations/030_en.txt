broadly extend to various organs, so there is virtually nothing in the body's operation that does not relate to these functions. Therefore, we merely establish distinctions and divide their respective domains.

Generally speaking, there is virtually nothing in the body's operation that does not depend on both sensibility and irritability mechanisms. However, these two mechanisms have their own distinctions. Therefore, if one wishes to observe the marvelous workings of natural creation and investigate disease mechanisms, it is most important to first analyze the functions of these two mechanisms. Hence, I now present their distinctions through comparison as follows:

[1] While irritability causes muscle fibers to contract and extend, sensibility never causes nerve fibers to contract or extend in the slightest. [2] When sensibility is obstructed or exhausted, irritability does not diminish but may actually become excessive. In conditions like sleep paralysis and convulsive spasms, although perception is lost, the strength of various muscles remains strong and the heart and arteries can still move. [3] There are substances that reduce sensibility while increasing irritability, such as the stupor from opium and intoxication from alcohol. Also, when tobacco smoke is introduced into the intestines, sensibility (pain sensation) decreases while irritability (peristaltic function) increases, thus facilitating bowel movements. [4] In cases such as infants, women, and patients with consumption, sensibility is acute but muscular strength (irritability) is fragile and cannot endure physical labor. [5] While sensibility responds even to incorporeal stimuli like mental influences, irritability can be found even in crude matter like plants.

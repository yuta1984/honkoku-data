This is the inherent natural force of the spinal cord. Therefore, it also has the name "nerve force" (Zenuw-kracht). Generally speaking, when nerves sense external objects, that sensation reaches both the brain and muscles. What reaches the brain travels from the peripheral branches back to the source and arrives at the spinal cord, thereby making one aware of pain, itching, cold, and heat, and enabling one to distinguish all manner of phenomena. This is called "nerve recognition force" (Gewaarwording-kracht).

The so-called recognition force does not refer to the power of the mind. It refers to the nerve force that enables the mind to recognize and distinguish (similarly, the nerve motor force mentioned next does not mean that nerves themselves move, but rather it is the force that causes muscles to move). The mind is something that dwells in the brain and spinal cord of animals and is naturally distinct from vital force. Therefore, although there may be vital force, there are beings without mind. Plants are such examples. Among animals too, creatures like polyps (mentioned in botanical primers) have no brain or mind, yet they possess vital force and grow and move. In humans as well, in cases of epilepsy, apoplexy, paralysis and such, they live without recognition, and parts of hands and feet that are numb and paralyzed maintain life without mental sensation, and teeth, hair, nails, bones, ligaments and such, although lacking recognition and tactile sensation, continue to grow and maintain their physical form. From this, one should understand that mind and vital force must not be confused.

What reaches the muscles transmits the received sensation (from the mind or external stimulus) from the source to the peripheral branches, reaching the muscles and stimulating their fibers to cause contractive movement. This is called "nerve motor force" (Beweging-kracht)

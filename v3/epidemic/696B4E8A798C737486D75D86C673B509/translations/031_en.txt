method, when one touches only the nerve, the muscle fibers immediately respond and contract. 《Note: At this time, even though the nerve has already been separated from the brain and spinal cord and the spirit does not communicate, this response still occurs》. However, if the touching continues for a long time without ceasing, the nerve eventually becomes exhausted and the contraction of the muscle fibers naturally becomes relaxed. At this time, if one directly touches the muscle, there is still contractile force.

Therefore, it is clear that the sensibility mechanism exists separately from the irritability mechanism and is a unique neural force distinct from the mind itself.

Specific Responsiveness (Besondere Empfänglichkeit)

Generally, the human body consists of a collection of numerous organs and mechanisms. The construction of these various organs is of countless varieties. Therefore, although the entire body receives the same vital force, each organ and each viscus differs in sensibility and irritability, with their receptivity and resistance diverging from one another. This is called specific responsiveness. There are also two types of this:

First, substances that show no response whatsoever in various parts of the body respond only in one particular part. Light and sound are perceived only by the eyes and ears, while the nose and tongue do not recognize them; odors and tastes are perceived only by the nose and tongue, but the eyes and ears cannot distinguish them.

Second, even with the same stimulus, each part responds differently according to the differences in the parts. Tartar emetic stimulates the stomach causing vomiting, but when applied to the skin it causes rashes and pustules; horseradish and white mustard seed cause intense burning sensations on the tongue and skin, but when swallowed into the stomach no irritation is felt; carbonic acid gas benefits the stomach but harms the lungs; mercury stimulates the salivary glands causing salivation; and cantharis stimulates the kidneys promoting urination, and so forth.

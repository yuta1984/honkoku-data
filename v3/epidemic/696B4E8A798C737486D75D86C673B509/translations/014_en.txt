obtain substances.
　The other one is called the "inorganic body" (onbewerkt organismus). It lacks vital mechanisms and is not subject to life and death, obtaining nourishment from similar substances and adding from the outside to form its physical substance (such as air, water, metals, stones, and earth). All things except animals and plants belong to this category.
　In general, although the firmness and flexibility, contraction and extension, movement and stillness, and changes of all things in heaven and earth cannot be ultimately comprehended, there is nothing that does not emerge from the three actions of the creative force (allgemeine Naturkraft).
　　The three actions of the creative force are: Mechanismus (mechanical action), Chemismus (chemical action), and Dynamismus (dynamic action).
　　Mechanismus (hereafter abbreviated as "meka") is a general term for mechanical actions such as: obstructing what touches it, repelling what resists it, striking to move it, beating to break it, cutting to divide it, pressing to force upon it, and so forth. The force that causes such actions is called "mechanical force" (mechanische Kraft). These include attraction, cohesion, tension, gravity, and so forth. What is called "attraction" (Anziehungskraft) is the force by which like attracts like, for example, when oil is poured into water and stirred, water combines with water and oil combines with oil (in reality, it is not only similar substances that attract each other; all things attract each other regardless of similarity or difference. This is merely presented as a force of like attracting like temporarily to make it easier to understand in comparison with the interactive force mentioned next).
　What is called "cohesive force" (Zusammenhangskraft) is the force by which the constituent parts of matter cohere together to maintain their form (this is also an attractive force, but when separated

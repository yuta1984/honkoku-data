**Organizing Force (Bewirkende Kraft)**: The power that controls inorganic chemical forces to become organic chemical forces, and transforms lifeless matter into living matter. In the human body, the process by which food and drink are digested and exquisitely synthesized and harmonized to become chyle and then blood, containing oxygen that circulates throughout the entire body, generating vital energy (formative force) and nourishing all organs—all of this is the operation of this force.

**Morphogenic Force (Formende Kraft)**: The power that causes organic matter to combine and form shapes. Indeed, the reason why all organs collectively maintain their structural tissue unchanged from their formed beginning, each preserving a fixed pattern as they develop and grow, is due to the endowment of this force. That is, in the human body, although the substance of organs and fluids continuously deteriorates day and night without cease, they are cultivated and supplemented through food, drink, and air, maintaining their form down to muscles, bones, nails, teeth, and blood cells. Moreover, parts damaged by external injury are restored and regenerate new flesh in the original form—all of this also derives from the operation of this force.

Upon consideration, organizing force primarily governs the mixture and harmonization of living matter, while morphogenic force primarily governs its aggregation and formation. These belong to organic chemical force and organic mechanical force respectively. Indeed, processes like vascularization and ossification occur when morphogenic force remains normal while organizing force undergoes transformation. Conditions like bone tumors and excess flesh occur when organizing force remains unchanged while morphogenic force consistently deviates.

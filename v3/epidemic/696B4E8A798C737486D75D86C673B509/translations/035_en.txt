is also a stimulus; when brilliant light suddenly extinguishes and becomes dark, this is also a stimulus; when loud sounds suddenly cease and become silent, this is also a stimulus.

Vital Force Resistance (Wederwerkung or Opwekking or Prikkeling)
When vital force receives stimulation and becomes activated, this is called resistance. Therefore, all the various activities of life are entirely forms of resistance without exception. The eye's seeing, the tongue's tasting, the heart's contraction and expansion, the lungs' bellowing - all are resistance to their respective stimuli. For this reason, even though there is vital force, and even though stimulating substances provoke it, if there is no resistance, vital activities cannot find their proper function. Indeed, resistance refers not only to the excitement and arousal of these functions, but encompasses all manifestations beyond sensation. Therefore, even the failure of these functions is also called resistance. For example, when exposed to cold air and becoming chilled, this is resistance of the skin; when blood is lost and one faints, this is resistance of the brain and spinal cord.

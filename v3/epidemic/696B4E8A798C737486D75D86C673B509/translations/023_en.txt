Thus, one can understand the difference between these two forces.

Indeed, vital force is universally present in both solid and fluid substances, but it is particularly abundant in the blood's properties, where it forms the various organs and fluids. The spiritual fluid flows through the nerves to activate the entire body, and male essence enters the maternal body to cause pregnancy—all of these processes derive their power from the blood. That is, a single drop of seminal fluid responds to the quiescent, lifeless whole body (this refers to the ovular fluid in a woman's ovaries; "lifeless" means without activity, not that it is entirely devoid of vital mechanism) and endows it with morphogenic force, combining to form an embryonic whole. This morphogenic force is received from a single drop of male essence, which can be proven by the fact that physical appearance and characteristics often resemble those of the father.

In cases of paralysis and numbness of the limbs, although both sensation and movement are lost, the physical form can still be maintained because the vital force of the blood's properties nourishes it. However, when blood circulation is obstructed by constriction or arterial calcification, even if sensation and movement exist, that part will inevitably decay. This is because the vital force disappears and returns to inorganic chemical transformation. Therefore, vital force operates independently of sensation and movement (the power of nerves, brain, and various muscles) and specifically resides in the blood's properties.

Nevertheless, both the so-called responsive force (the power that governs sensation and movement, which will be discussed next) and vital force are fundamentally one source of life force. Therefore, when vascular movement increases, the coagulative force (vital force) of the blood's properties becomes vigorous (as seen in inflammatory diseases). Moreover, inflammation of the throat creates false membranes, and wounds and poisons produce abnormal flesh

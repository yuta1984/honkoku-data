One is called receptive force (Ontvankelijkheid), and the other is called reactive force (Terugwerkende Vermogen). Receptive force is the power to receive stimulation from external objects. Reactive force is the power that reacts against this and becomes active. Although reception and reaction are originally functions of one force, among the organs within the body, there are those whose reception is quick but whose reaction is not strong (such as the brain and nerves). There are those whose reaction is strong but whose reception is not quick (such as muscles and ligaments). From this, one can understand that there are distinctions. The reason why various parts of the human body each differ in their responsive conditions is due to the fact that the relationship between these two forces does not maintain the same state.

One should not directly refer to vital force as responsive force. Responsive force is merely one manifestation of vital force. Therefore, there are cases where vital force exists without responsive force. This is called latent life (Gebonden Toestand der Levenskracht). For example, like a bird's egg. Although it is simply an inert fluid, it does not decay for several weeks, and if it is covered and warmed, responsive force immediately activates and it can suddenly hatch. This can be understood from the fact that vital force is stored latently within it.

Although the functions of vital force response are manifold, when unified they fall into three categories: perceptive mechanism, motor mechanism, and individual responsive mechanism.

Perceptive Mechanism (Gevoeligheid)
The perceptive mechanism is the mechanism by which one perceives and senses through touch, namely the nerves and brain.

Furthermore, although blood stimulation is generally the same throughout the entire body, the liver resists it to produce bile, the kidneys resist it to secrete urine, and the brain resists it to manufacture cerebral fluid, with each organ differing in the function of its responsive capacity. Therefore, the human body is considered to be one in which the various vital mechanisms of numerous regions gather together to form one unified great vital mechanism.

Upon examination, there are major agreements and minor differences among various authorities regarding the classification of vital forces. Blumenbach divides these into five categories: nervous force, muscular force, contractile force, nutritive force, and organ-specific forces. Except for contractile force, the others do not differ from what is explained in this volume (however, what is explained in this volume follows the same theory of three authorities: Vogel, Christison, and Conbruch). According to his theory, contraction and shortening is the inherent force of muscle fibers, while closure and constriction is the inherent force of cellular tissue. Therefore, muscular force and contractile force should not be confused (Roze criticizes this, saying that contractile force is a cohesive force commonly possessed by inorganic bodies as well, and should not be considered a vital force action).

Rieseland and Bichat say that all vital mechanisms arise from two mechanisms - sensibility and contractility - with only the distinction of manifest and latent (Roze holds almost the same view but with minor differences). Namely, plant fibers depending on soil moisture for nourishment and animal fibers depending on blood for this are considered the work of latent sensibility and latent contractility; movements of the heart, stomach, and intestines are considered the work of latent sensibility and manifest contractility; and voluntary movements of various muscles are considered the work of manifest sensibility and manifest contractility.

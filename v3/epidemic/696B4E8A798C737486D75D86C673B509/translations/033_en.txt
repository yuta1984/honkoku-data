considers vital force to be the combination of tensile and contractile forces that all things possess in common, with both nutritive and responsive mechanisms being the action of both contractile and tensile forces. He comprehensively divides all operations of the human body into nutritive mechanisms and motor mechanisms, subdividing motor mechanisms into cellular motor mechanisms, muscular motor mechanisms, and nervous motor mechanisms, and subdividing nutritive mechanisms into progressive mechanisms (Vorwärts-gehende Formung) and regressive mechanisms (Rückwärts-gehende Formung). However, when it comes to their theoretical explanations, all authorities have no major differences.

Stimulating Substances (Prikkel)
Although organic bodies possess vital force and have both sensory and motor mechanisms, and various organs also have their own responsive mechanisms, without something to provoke and activate them, they cannot manifest the function of their vital force, just like bird eggs that have not yet been incubated. All things that provoke and cause resistance to arise are called stimulating substances. Therefore, stimulating substances are indispensable for life even for a moment. If they are lacking, then the operations of all organs will necessarily cease completely.

Indeed, stimulating substances are not only those that provoke vital force and stimulate movement, but also refer to those that suppress and diminish movement. Therefore, so-called stimulating substances, whether tangible or intangible, are a general term for all things that can affect vital force and cause its fluctuation. Therefore, within the body, various fluids and gases, waking and sleeping, movement and stillness, mental thoughts, and the seven emotions - not one fails to be a stimu-

—this is the meaning (hereafter abbreviated as "affinity force"). However, substances differ in whether they possess this force or not, and there are degrees of affinity and aversion. Thus, while water has affinity force with salt, it has no affinity force with oil. Also, while sulfuric acid and magnesia have intimate affinity force, this does not match the supreme affinity between sulfuric acid and potassium. Therefore, when potassium is added to a solution of Epsom salt (formed by the combination of sulfuric acid and magnesia), the sulfuric acid naturally separates from the magnesia and combines with potassium (forming potassium sulfate and dissolving), while the magnesia alone loses its partner and precipitates.

Dynamismus (dynamic action) (hereafter abbreviated as "dynamics") is a general term for the actions of elements that cannot be measured by scales, such as caloric, light, electricity, galvanism, magnetism, etc. Since these various elements belong almost entirely to the intangible realm, their actions naturally differ in their circumstances from mechanical force and chemical force. (The above three forces are the source of nature's mysterious workings, and though they would be difficult to understand readily without detailed explanation, since this is not the main purpose of this book, only their general outline is shown here. One should further consult other works such as "Meibotsu-kō Hoi," "Kaikai Kanran," "Seimi Kaishū," etc.)

Now, to speak of one or two examples of these three actions: water flows on the ground surface because it is heavier than air (mechanical action), but when heat is applied to it (dynamic action), its tensile force increases and it becomes light, floating in the air (mechanical action). When it rises and reaches cold regions, the heat is taken away (dynamic action) and attractive force assumes full authority, about to congeal and take form (mechanical action). However, elec-

resist and contract and dilate, thus moving greatly. From this we should understand that the movement of muscle fibers does not necessarily depend on nervous force.

Upon consideration, although irritability is said to be an inherent force of muscle fibers, this mechanism also exists in parts without muscle fibers. The lungs receive air and expand and contract like bellows, the uterus constricts during childbirth, and in plants, flowers open and stamens naturally touch the pistils. Indeed, both the lungs and uterus have a honeycomb-like cellular structure without muscle fibers, and flower stamens naturally should not have muscle fibers either. Yet such movements still occur. Therefore, what we call irritability cannot necessarily be considered solely an inherent force of muscle fibers. Sensibility is also not necessarily a force limited to nerves. Even parts without nerves can sometimes produce sensations due to disease, such as bone pain from syphilis or hair pain from plica polonica. Therefore, both irritability and sensibility are the same responsive force, but due to differences in fiber composition, sometimes receptive power is vigorous, sometimes resistance predominates - in muscles it becomes irritability, in nerves it becomes sensibility, in the uterus it becomes the uterus's own responsive mechanism, and in the lungs it becomes the lungs' own responsive mechanism. Ultimately, both sensibility and irritability can all be called distinct responsive mechanisms. (When muscles and nerves have abnormal fiber composition due to disease, they cannot manifest sensory and motor functions properly; similarly, when other organs have abnormal composition resembling muscles and nerves, they too should be able to develop sensory and motor functions.) However, muscle fibers and nerve fibers are

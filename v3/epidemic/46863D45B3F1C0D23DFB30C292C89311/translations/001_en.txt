For festivals and prayers, rely on Buddhist monks and shrine maidens, and for illness, entrust it to medicine—then serious complications will rarely occur. To be confused in mind and not use medicine, making daily visits to the graves of demons and spirits, is a poor way of thinking. Master Kōshū also said not to worship spirits. The Ryūseishū records a solicitation document for building shrines to demons and spirits. Such things are common in both Japan and China, and so forth.

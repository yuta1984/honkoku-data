that I did not contract [cholera] was entirely due to the power of the disinfection method.

In early November of the same year, I returned to Tokyo and came into contact with patients at the cholera hospital in Koishikawa Kobinata, and also went to the cholera hospital in Natakiri Village, Miura District, Kanagawa Prefecture, where I came into contact with cholera patients. However, that I was spared from infection was entirely due to the merit of this disinfection, which I deeply believe.

Throughout this period, whenever I approached cholera patients, I sprayed carbolic acid water on my body. Also, when handling items that came near patients, I applied carbolic acid water spray to those items.

From September to November of the same year, I examined no fewer than three hundred cholera patients in total. During this time, sometimes I diagnosed after death, sometimes my both hands were soiled with vomit or feces (not to mention my clothes and both feet), and sometimes I frequently walked over the graves of dozens of freshly buried bodies, yet I was spared from this virulent disease poison as mentioned before - I truly believe this was due to the great effectiveness of carbolic acid water. Now, for the sake of the people, I repeatedly and thoroughly describe the efficacy of this good medicine. During cholera epidemics, this medicinal water must be sprayed on clothing, and for patients, of course, on all their clothing, bedding, and futons

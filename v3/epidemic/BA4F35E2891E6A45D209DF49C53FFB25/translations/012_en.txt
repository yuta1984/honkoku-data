It became epidemic in the ninth year of Enryaku under Emperor Kammu, year of the metal horse (790 CE). The intervals between these epidemics are no different from today's measles epidemics—when all people have been afflicted and there are no more people who should fall ill, there are no more patients until it is transmitted again from foreign countries. This is evidence that it is caused neither by seasonal atmospheric influences nor by the qi of the land. After the ninth year of Enryaku, it seems the disease circulated in various places even without transmission from foreign countries, and it is recorded in the "Continued Chronicles of Japan" that it existed widely throughout all provinces of the realm. Considering various records, after the ninth year of Enryaku, there is no evidence of unified nationwide epidemics. Today, remote regions experience outbreaks once every six or seven years, but the three major cities (Kyoto, Osaka, Edo) never cease to have cases. This is not because the climate differs between cities and remote areas causing different epidemic patterns, but because the three cities have large populations, so while the disease circulates, many are also being born and many do not fall ill, hence it never ceases. Moreover, beggars carrying smallpox children are particularly pitied by people, so I hear that many beggars go to the cities as soon as they begin to suffer from smallpox. Even in remote areas, those who travel far spreading smallpox are beggars with

smallpox children. Also, looking at records from the Warring States period, unlike today, many people fell ill with smallpox at advanced ages. This too is not because the climate differs between times of war and peace, but because in continuously turbulent and chaotic times, people limited themselves to the boundaries of their provinces and counties, with little friendly interaction, so naturally diseases were not transmitted either. Even today, people in the Kansai region naturally have rare contact with smallpox, so many fall ill at advanced ages. As mentioned before, if one does not approach the patients, smell their odor, or touch their clothing, toys, food, etc., it is a disease easily avoided during one's lifetime. Therefore, people should thoroughly understand that this is completely different from formless evil qi that arises from atmospheric disturbances of the year, and that one falls ill only through contagion. Epidemic diseases are also easily transmitted, but mostly they spread to people suffering in poverty or those with poor conduct in normal times, and do not spread indiscriminately to just anyone. However, with epidemic diseases of this type, some people naturally fall ill even when the local qi is not disturbed enough to cause transmission, so this cannot be helped. Smallpox...

Although there are various theories, first considering that saying "fetal poison" is appropriate and without error, and taking it as an unchanging and clear explanation for posterity, since no one again seeks the source of that disease, people do not understand at all why smallpox and measles are contracted once in a lifetime, why their duration is limited, or why they are contagious. Since everyone establishes their own theories as they please, the doubts in medical texts are never resolved. The theory of "fetal poison" sounds plausible, but it is actually evidence that fails to clarify the source of disease. The reason for this is as follows: generally, humans are the leaders of all things in heaven and earth, and are extremely spiritual beings. They are spiritual because they can commune with all things in heaven and earth. They can commune because they possess within their bodies the qi of all things in heaven and earth, and thus commune with them. For this reason, beginning with knowing taste through the mouth, color through the eyes, fragrance through the nose, and sound through the ears, the movement of the heart through joy, anger, sorrow and pleasure, the melting of the soul through the emotions between men and women, and suffering from the arising of various diseases - all these occur because the qi possessed within since before birth resonates with things that exist outside

Because they resonate with external things. However, the degree of this resonance differs for each person in concentration, thickness, presence or absence. This is precisely the reason why people differ in intelligence and foolishness, longevity and short life, strength and weakness, proneness to disease or freedom from disease. This is called natural endowment or constitution - that is, heavenly endowment and heavenly mandate. In humans, this is called nature. The concentration, thickness, presence, absence, and quantity of this nature varies greatly. For this reason, some people, even if they study singing and musical instruments throughout their lives, cannot harmonize even a single phrase. This is because they do not possess the tuning of the five tones within their bodies. Such people are called "without rhythm." People who possess the five tones within their bodies know tuning as naturally as an echo responds to a voice. These are called "with rhythm." Although they possess the five tones in their nature, the differences in skill levels in musical arts are due to variations in the concentration and thickness of musical pitch within their bodies. In terms of disease, this is called innate poison. The concentration, thickness, presence, absence, and quantity of this poison differs for each person. For this reason, even if one shares a pillow with someone suffering from contagious diseases like syphilis or scabies throughout life, one may not contract

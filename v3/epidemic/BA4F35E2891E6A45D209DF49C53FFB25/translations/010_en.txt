No matter how much one avoids them, many people naturally fall ill. When the evil qi dissipates as before, the illness also naturally subsides. This occurs within qi, invisible to human eyes, and when people become ill, there is no discernible form, hence it is called "formless evil qi." Smallpox and similar conditions are a type of swelling with odor and form, hence called "tangible toxic qi." This toxic qi, regardless of excesses or deficiencies in cold, heat, warmth, or coolness, transmits from person to person and is a malignant disease that never ceases to exist in the world. Similar diseases include measles, syphilis, and scabies. These also transmit from person to person regardless of atmospheric conditions of cold, heat, warmth, coolness, or seasonal influences. These are called "the four diseases of tangible contagion." These are all caused by disordered yin-yang qi, and their origin arose in foreign lands. First, I will record the origins of these four diseases below to clarify that they are not heavenly epidemics and enlighten the delusions of medical schools past and present.

　　　Beginning

From ancient times to the present, understanding smallpox as a seasonal epidemic that spreads due to the atmospheric influences of a given year, and considering it a mysterious and wondrous disease because it occurs only once in a lifetime, medical texts have given it alternative names such as "sacred pox" and "heavenly flower pox," and common people understand it as an illness caused by the smallpox deity—this is a grave error. This disease is neither due to the atmospheric influences of a given year nor a particularly mysterious illness; it occurs because there are reasons why one should fall ill in this way. Generally, there is not a single disease that is not mysterious—they are all strange and wondrous. First, let us properly understand and examine this.

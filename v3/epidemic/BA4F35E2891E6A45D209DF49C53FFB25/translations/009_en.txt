Naturally, there may be many boastful words and presumptuous expressions. I only hope that readers will forgive these faults and become allies in this great benevolent art of saving countless people in the future.

1. What is explained in this book differs greatly from ancient and modern medical texts as well as common understanding among people. First, I present evidence that smallpox and measles are contagious diseases, thereby refuting the false theory in medical books that claims these are "heavenly epidemics that cause fetal toxins to manifest." Second, I clarify the source of all diseases arising from the myriad types of toxic qi inherent in human nature. Third, I explain the harmony and discord between vital qi and toxic qi, elucidating the principle that all diseases occur once in a lifetime. These are all natural laws. Other matters—errors in medical texts regarding disease origins, and methods for distinguishing the forms of various diseases in invisible qi before they manifest as illness in people—all such subtle medical theories are discussed in the Chinese text of the original work and are abbreviated here. Readers should not doubt these different explanations or regard them as heretical. End

This is not due to the protection of gods and buddhas, nor to the use of medicines, but simply because they do not allow those suffering from smallpox to enter their territories and do not travel to places where smallpox exists. On rare occasions when someone contracts the poison, they call it "flying pox," build a hut in a place separated from the village, ask someone who has had smallpox to care for them, and return home after the scabs fall off. Also, when an outbreak occurs while they are in other provinces, they quickly flee from that place. Since this is a disease that can be avoided throughout one's life simply by avoiding and shunning it, it is not a seasonal epidemic caused by atmospheric conditions, nor a disease arising from local qi, but undoubtedly a contagious disease like syphilis and scabies. Diseases caused by the atmospheric conditions of a given year arise from various evil qi that develop amid cold, heat, warmth, and coolness, becoming human ailments, so no matter how much...

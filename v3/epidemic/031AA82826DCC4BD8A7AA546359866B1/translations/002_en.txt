This concerns the time when epidemics spread in villages throughout the provinces, and common people suffered hardships from poisoning by miscellaneous foods. Regarding the medicinal prescription documents distributed to villages in Kyōhō 18, Year of the Ox, since much time has passed, some villages may have lost them. Therefore, copies are now being circulated to villages for relief purposes as ordered, so administrators of shogunal domain villages should ensure complete circulation within their respective jurisdictions without omission.

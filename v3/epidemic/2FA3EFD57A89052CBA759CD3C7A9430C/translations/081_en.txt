136　　　　　　　　　　　Role of Skin in Infection and Immunity
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
appears necessary to maintain, for pathologists the skin has been far from having similar importance until today.

Due to its vast surface area and direct relationship with the external world, the skin organ is exposed to shocks, trauma, and contamination more than any other organ. When the continuation of equilibrium decreases or is destroyed, it is taken advantage of by bacteria coming from soil or air or bacteria that constantly cover the surface of the epidermis. Particularly staphylococci have the habit of preferring to reside permanently in the tubes of hair follicles and seize every opportunity to invade the interior of cells. Even when there is little lack of local or systemic resistance, skin damage can occur. Depending on the virulence of invading bacteria, according to the nature of the cells being attacked, and in response to individual resistance, the lesions show more or less marked severe symptoms.

Besides lesions caused by damage to the skin surface, other causes show little variation and are endogenous; that is, as seen during the course of typhus, typhus fever, and other exanthematous diseases.

Because pathogens invade the skin covering from the external world or internally and secondarily establish themselves there, the skin is always only receiving infection, and the significance of biological defense is rather passive, and according to Metchnikoff's expressive definition, it comes down to the significance of a "sheath for self-protection."

This way of thinking no longer applies today based on facts we have recently learned. Before examining these facts, I would like to describe the structure and main functions of the skin, whose cooperation ensures natural immunity in the physiological state.

The skin consists of two clearly distinguishable parts embryologically and histologically: namely, the epithelium arising from ectoplasm and the dermis arising from mesoplasm.

The epithelium consists of epithelial cells layered like cobblestones, whose upper part continuously changes to a keratinous state. The scales of epithelial cells eventually exfoliate and are supplemented by cells coming from deep layers and heading toward the surface. During their shedding, the exfoliated keratinous cells carry bacteria and simultaneously carry debris containing bacteria; keratinous cells thus participate in skin purification and its permanent renewal.

As soon as one leaves this surface part, namely the stratum corneum, before reaching the deep part of the epithelium, one encounters the cell layer of the transitional part: namely, this is the Stratum lucidum consisting of colorless transparent elements.

The epithelial part immediately below this is occupied by the mucilaginous body, namely the Malpighian network. Numerous cell layers cooperate to constitute this network; these are protoplasmic cells without coverings. It should be noted that these cells are adjacent to each other with branched lymphatic elements whose nature was long undetermined. Namely, these lymphatic elements—which we know today—are none other than white blood cells, that is, phagocytic elements.

In cases of trauma or infection, these phagocytic cells flow in large numbers and invade intercellular spaces, and by their well-known inherent property, we see them approach anywhere that should be called positive chemotaxis.

Beyond the epithelium, we reach the second layer forming the foundation of the covering, namely the dermis. This dermis consists of a network of extremely tough elastic fibers that intersect with connective tissue elements. Throughout the tissue we see the migration of wandering lymph cells. These lymph cells, which have the most remarkable phagocytic action, appear in particularly large numbers during inflammation of the covering. Furthermore, one should recall that the dermis shows on its entire surface numerous small papillae as well as abundant sweat glands and sebaceous glands recognizing dense tissue.

The simple anatomy we described has made us aware of the significance of skin in preserving its natural immunity; this will facilitate understanding of certain problems concerning the mechanisms of infection and artificial immunity.

Due to the complexity of skin structure, we must account for the diversity of its functions. Therefore, let us describe here the physiology we have learned.

The covering called skin shows a vast surface with keen sensations. The skin receives various stimuli that are the starting point for most of our sensations: namely, touch, warmth, cold, and pain. These sensations protect us against harmful external elements and contribute to the maintenance of natural immunity.

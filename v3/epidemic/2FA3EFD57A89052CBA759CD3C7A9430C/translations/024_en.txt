　　　　　　　　Is There One or Multiple Types of Streptococci?
　　　Do One or Several Streptococci Exist?(1)

　This problem, which was first posed nearly at the beginning of our bacteriological knowledge and has persisted for a long time, is still awaiting its answer. Research on this problem is not lacking; rather, it has been studied quite extensively. There is agreement that the difficulty lies in the classification method.
　This problem has, however, become increasingly important. It not only satisfies scientific curiosity but also serves as a guide for all anti-streptococcal sera.
　The problem placed in the practical domain is reduced to the following: Does a serum made with a specific streptococcus act against all other streptococci, or not? This question does not, of course, encompass all problems, but it targets the most urgent point to be resolved.
　All opinions expressed on this problem can be reduced to two points: Monists see that the individual tendencies observed between different strains of streptococci dissolve in the face of general characteristics common to streptococci as a whole; in contrast, pluralists consider these tendencies to be indispensable and think that grouping all chain-forming organisms under the same banner is completely unjustified.
　To conduct a lecture with a definite policy between these opposing opinions, we shall describe papers brought from various quarters, avoiding as much as possible detailed descriptions and statistics that only hinder a unified view. We shall seek valuable papers of various kinds available to us, and if we find both those supporting and opposing the lecture...

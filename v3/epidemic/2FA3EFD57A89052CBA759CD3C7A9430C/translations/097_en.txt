　　　　　　　　　　　Stomatitis and Alveolar Osteo-Periostitis
　　　　　　　Stomatite et Ostéo-Périostite Alvéolaire,

　A 30-year-old patient with characteristic ulcerative stomatitis (bad breath, pain and swelling of submandibular glands), treated for 3 months with little sign of improvement. Mixed antivirus was applied. Pain disappeared and complete healing occurred after three days.
　Another patient, himself a physician, visited the clinic with symptoms of acute alveolar osteo-periostitis. He received conventional treatment (bone drilling, irrigation, etc.). Pain persisted, and after 3 nights of continued insomnia, the patient demanded tooth extraction. As a last resort, we recommended trying staphylococcal-streptococcal antivirus: a small amount was injected into the root canal, after which the opening was sealed.
　Two hours after this application, the pain stopped. The next day the tooth became completely insensitive, whereas until the previous day even light touch caused extremely severe pain.

　　　　　　　　　　　Burns
　　　　　　　　　　Brûlures

　If further extended, this serves as a portal of entry for pathogenic bacteria; treatment aims to promote epithelial formation of wounds and prevent infection. In this case, antivirus becomes an indicated biological disinfectant: that is, it opposes suppuration, does not exert harmful effects on cells, but rather strengthens their resistance. Scar formation and epithelialization are promoted immediately after application of special bandages, and the injured person feels sufficiently improved.
　Observation I　Miss O.D., 16 years old, third-degree burns extending over the entire inner surface of the left upper limb, surfaces of both breasts, both surfaces of the left hand, and half the surface of the right hand. The burns were severely infected.
　March 20, 1924, compresses soaked with vaccine were applied to all areas where exposed skin was somewhat deeply affected. The next day, all damaged parts had already recovered 1/3 of the surface; the still-exposed parts showed no infection and no abundant eruptions. March 25, epithelialization occurred over the entire left arm surface. Only several small fluid exudates were still observed. The wound surface of the right breast healed; the wound surface of the left breast developed epithelium over more than half its area. March 27, recovery became marked. The final vaccine bandage was on March 29; then dry bandaging was performed.

　Observation II　Mrs. M.J., 22 years old. Fourth-degree burns extending from the front of the left shoulder to both surfaces of the hand. In the center, there was a large eschar with a drainage opening. Subcutaneous cellular tissue was exposed and severely suppurating.
　May 12, antivirus bandages were applied. On the 14th, the gangrenous part separated very easily. All

parts were exposed with bright red blood exuding, and suppuration became extremely minimal. After washing with boiled water, dry bandages were applied on the 16th; exudate gradually increased; some points were still infected, so we decided to apply a cream-like antivirus layer to these. On the 18th, the wound showed a good course of scar formation and ceased suppurating further.

　　　　　　　　Infected Wounds and Phlegmon
　　　　　　　　Plaies Infectées et Phlegmones

　Observation I　Phlegmon of the hand with lymphangitis of the forearm. After opening the tendon sheaths of flexor and extensor muscles above the palm and wrist, bouillon-vaccine was injected into the wound. Antiseptic and special bandages were alternated. Healing occurred in 12 days. The results were extremely good, adds Dr. P of Saint-Mihiel, because by the 6th day everything had emptied and healing was assured without leaving any weakness.

　Observation II　Male affected by phlegmon of the knee, fever 38°, skin strongly infiltrated, glossy, and covered with pustules; pain severe with little tendency to improve. Pain was reduced within 10 minutes after application of antivirus bandages.
　In 12 hours, temperature returned to normal, swelling disappeared, pustules dried, and the patient was able to flex his knee to the point of performing a plié (knee-bending movement in dance).
　Three days after treatment, the patient was able to walk.

　Observation III　Phlegmon of the mandibular angle, following caries of wisdom tooth. The suppurative cavity was punctured and emptied, and one syringe of bouillon-vaccine was injected twice daily. It healed dry without forming a fistula, with no need to resort to incision.

　Observation IV　Osteomyelitis, treated for a year and a half for a fistula with permanent drainage following multiple surgeries (knee resection, gradually eliminating necrotic bone fragments, multiple curettages during new surgeries). In August, it progressed acutely: fever, local pain, swelling, redness. An abscess formed; incision drained 200g of pus. Gauze soaked with large amounts of staphylococcal antivirus was inserted for drainage. Compression bandages soaked with the same antivirus were applied.
　The next day, the compression bandages were moistened with serum containing no pus.
　From about the 3rd day, profuse secretion became less marked. Gauze was removed. After several more days, the wound closed with no purulent discharge remaining.
　That is, with two repetitions, the patient had previously formed similar abscesses at the same location; with incision and drainage, improvement required about 3 weeks each time, whereas with antivirus influence

and cases characterized by contamination with clothing fragments deserved our attention. Tissue that is torn apart, flooded with blood, and devitalized by contusion provides, though not well understood, a selective culture medium for pathogenic bacteria. Damaged cells with reduced natural immunity offer no barrier whatsoever to bacterial proliferation. The most rigorous bactericidal action can do nothing in such cases.

Antivirus therapy, which utilizes the body's natural resources, was applied in our opinion to cases such as the following: for example, gas gangrene, osteomyelitis, suppurative arthritis, or open epiphyseal fractures, which became Lister's first monument and still concern surgeons today. Even the most skilled surgeons today still confess that mortality rates are high in patients with these fractures. The wound over a fracture always either risks infection if sutured or indefinitely delays treatment if not sutured, while still being unable to avoid osteitis and sequestra with certainty. Faced with this great contradiction, would it not be rational to thoroughly soak the wound surface with antivirus, or to instill antivirus continuously or intermittently into devitalized tissue? What about using antivirus instead of Dakin's solution in Carrel's drainage tube "system" for similar cases as described above?

Collection of localized pus within the pleural cavity and especially within the abdominal cavity has already succeeded in treatment by local application of antivirus. In our opinion, antivirus is particularly effective in cases of preoperative vaccination. Since local immunity of organs was obtained very rapidly, it opened similar hope for postoperative vaccine therapy.

When examining the various eras through which dressing methods have passed and referring them to immunological theory, one can hardly prevent the establishment of correlative relationships between them.

The entire prehistoric period of medicine, the period when the significance of bacteria was completely unknown, was the era of contaminated bandage application.

When the action of pathogenic bacteria was discovered, both internal medicine and surgery had only one purpose: to eliminate them by direct action using bactericidal substances; on one hand from the concept of humoral immunity, and on the other hand through bandage application with disinfectants.

The discovery of phagocytosis, which attributed value to the organism's significance in bacterial destruction, saw the triumph of cellular immunity theory in internal medicine and aseptic bandages in surgery.

Today, knowing that not only leukocytes ensure the body's defense, but that all cells are susceptible to infection and truly immunizable in the real sense, we have encountered a new era: on one hand the theory of local immunity, and on the other hand, as a natural inevitable consequence, the era of specific bandages.

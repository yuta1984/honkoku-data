must occur. After vaccination, when these cells are sufficiently bound, bacteria remain harmless—even if extremely toxic. They are treated as saprophytic bacteria and follow their fate: bacteria easily become prey to phagocytic cells. Needless to say, the same bacteria subsequently placed in contact with receptive cells will not be able to recover their original virulence. To give an example here: inject highly virulent anthrax bacilli intraperitoneally into a guinea pig with necessary precautions. Since there are no receptive cells there, these anthrax bacilli cannot cause any harm to the animal; rather, the anthrax bacilli are destroyed by leukocytes. However, if, without waiting for their complete destruction, one were to perform intraperitoneal injection with an empty needle, even if a single viable anthrax bacillus exists in the peritoneal cavity, it will not fail to kill the guinea pig: even though saprophytic in the peritoneal cavity, anthrax bacilli become toxic again while passing through the skin. Toxins such as those of diphtheria, when injected into mice and circulating in their bodies, do not endanger life, yet they still retain toxicity against other animals with strong susceptibility.

　The facts observed regarding virulence would leave a stain of misunderstanding on the explanation of certain phenomena of immunity, unless a certain property is equally distributed throughout the entire living body rather than existing in a specific group of cells. However, it is clear that many studies on immunity in anthrax must have felt the obscurity of the skin's significance. This is because when one observes only what occurs in subcutaneous or intraperitoneal exudate after injecting pathogens subcutaneously or intraperitoneally, one overlooks the truth: this involves investigating what occurs within the skin, namely this permanent wound created by all our surgical procedures. Even when one is satisfied with pursuing the fate of bacteria only at the site where anthrax bacilli were injected, one merely gathers echoes that the main site of infection lies elsewhere.

　This observation made in the case of anthrax is also valuable for pathogens such as typhus bacilli, dysentery bacilli, and cholera bacilli. Until today, whenever one wishes to know the reaction of normal or immune animals given a single inoculation, it has become customary to pursue the fate of bacteria in blood, peritoneal cavity, or subcutaneously—according to the portal of bacterial entry. All organs are examined equally, but the special attitude occurring at intestinal wall sites is not observed; yet this is what primarily concerns the animal's fate.

　Now that we know how great the autonomy regarding cellular binding capacity is, we must place research on immunity within the practical scope of binding organs.

　Here, somewhat schematically, let us show how the various phases of infection, and subsequently those leading to immunity, can be represented.

　No matter how strong an infection may be, in cases of skin or mucosal invasion, it is always leukocytes that first participate in and initially receive the impact of the invasion. Even if leukocytes succeed in capturing all bacteria or only a portion of them, infection subsequently occurs mainly at the site of receptive cells.

　When infection is not severe, bacteria do not break through the layer of receptive cells. Cells with strong affinity adsorb most of the pathogens or anti-pathogens released by phagocytic cells. Thus, cells prevent infection from spreading throughout the body. If their appetite for pathogens is satisfied, new infections no longer attack the cells, because the cells can no longer participate in reactions thereafter.

　When infection is severe and leukocytes become incapable of phagocytosis, bacteria continue their invasive march and collide with the second line of barriers represented by receptive cells. In moments of existential danger, receptive cells adsorb as many pathogens as possible; however, their significance as shields is insufficient. These cells become saturated and eventually begin to overflow one after another. The individual's fate depends on the outcome of the struggle between pathogens and phagocytic cells in the blood. Since the outcome of this struggle has been known in great detail since Metchnikoff's memorable research, we think it would be superfluous to elaborate on it here.

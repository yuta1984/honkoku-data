hours later) returned to normal; in rabbits that received ordinary vaccines, body temperature rose gradually and did not decline until 24-36 hours had passed.

The sensitized rabbits maintained a nearly normal appearance even at the peak of fever, while the other rabbits showed pathological symptoms and frequently developed diarrhea. At the third injection, the rabbits receiving ordinary "vaccine" died, but the sensitized rabbits were able to tolerate it sufficiently.

The main interest of Garbat and Meyer's research lies in the study of serum from both groups of rabbits. The serum of rabbits receiving ordinary "vaccine" showed strong agglutination (1:100-1:500) already 6 days after the first injection. At the same time period, the serum of sensitized rabbits showed almost no agglutination (1:10-1:20). After the second and third injections, agglutination titers rose markedly in ordinary rabbits; in sensitized rabbits there was no significant change.

The same was true regarding the serum's ability to bind complement: it increased extremely in the serum of ordinary rabbits. This property was hardly recognized in sensitized rabbits.

These demonstrations had to lead the authors to conclude that antibodies did not exist in the serum of sensitized animals. However, when the purpose was to study preventive effects, they confirmed that the serum of sensitized rabbits not only almost lacked preventive antibodies but contained even more of these antibodies than the serum of ordinary rabbits (note: rabbits injected with ordinary "vaccine"). That is, although sensitized rabbit serum was only 2 to 4 hours post-inoculation, it could protect fresh guinea pigs against typhus infection, while ordinary rabbit serum proved completely ineffective under the same conditions.

These experiments by Garbat and Meyer are interesting in many respects. This experiment shows the mechanism of action of sensitized "vaccine" and the reason for its superiority over ordinary "vaccine." Furthermore, this experiment shows that there is no correlation between what occurs in vitro and in vivo, and that neither agglutination reactions nor complement fixation reactions can be claimed as indicators of immunity level.

Bacterial Hemolysins (1)
The biology of bacteria has made remarkable progress since achieving success in obtaining diphtheria toxin in vitro. This was the best example of the significance that soluble products should have in bacterial infections. Following this discovery made by Roux and Yersin in 1888, numerous other toxins—those of tetanus, botulinus, cholera, etc.—followed in succession. Today, several years later, it is surprising to see that while the types of known pathogenic bacteria are very numerous, the number of toxins is still extremely limited.
　We must consider the mediation of soluble products when harmful bacteria capable of attacking distant cells are present. It is certain that these soluble products exist most frequently, and even if we cannot yet clarify this, it is merely due to the imperfection of our experimental methods.
　The discovery of bacterial hemolysins should be considered the first step toward understanding true bacterial toxins.
　Even if hemolysins have little toxicity, their kinship with true toxins, i.e., lethal toxins, should not be denied. The property of certain bacteria to dissolve red blood cells is clearly not an accidental occurrence. According to all probability, this is a mode of bacterial reaction; hemolysin is one of the soluble products by which it should act on living cells. Perhaps in infectious diseases such as those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or typhoid bacilli, this is relatively inconspicuous, but the significance of soluble substances is quite clear in streptococci, for example.
　Based on this finding, we shall describe what we know about known bacterial hemolysins.

　The first to be observed was tetanus hemolysin. It was announced by Ehrlich in the culture filtrate of tetanus bacilli and carefully studied by his disciple Madsen. This is a sui generis substance that does not share common properties with tetanus toxin—tetanospasmine—and its production method.
　Tetanolysin dissolves the red blood cells of most domestic animals, particularly those of rabbits and horses; goat blood cells, in contrast, have relatively strong resistance. When brought into contact with red blood cells, tetanolysin does not dissolve red blood cells instantaneously; the diffusion of hemoglobin is preceded by a latent period. This period is shortened by excess hemolysin or by selection of appropriate temperature. This temperature plays a significant role, and similarly for all bacterial and cellular hemolysins: the residence time in an incubator markedly promotes the action of tetanolysin.
　Unlike the specific tetanus toxin, tetanus hemolysin changes very easily. It is completely destroyed by heating at 50° for 20 minutes. To observe this, dilution with a small amount of physiological saline solution is sufficient, and it weakens markedly after one hour. Even in concentrated salt solution (4%), tetanolysin placed at 20° for 5 hours loses half of its hemolytic power. To succeed in preservation for at least 24 hours, it must be placed at 0° in sealed test tubes. That which is precipitated by ammonium sulfate and made into powder form can be preserved for long periods.
　Therefore, tetanolysin is an extremely unstable substance, and it can be added that it is the most unstable among all known hemolysins. This property alone eliminates any concern of confusing it with tetanus toxin; that is, tetanus toxin remains almost unchanged for some time and fears neither dilution nor slight temperature increases.
　These two substances—tetanolysin and tetanospasmine—have not been separated, but they are certainly different substances. Animals immunized with tetanus bacilli culture filtrate rich in tetanolysin produce, in addition to the known tetanus antitoxin, further antihemolysin. These two types of antitoxins are formed in various amounts; also extremely [text cuts off]

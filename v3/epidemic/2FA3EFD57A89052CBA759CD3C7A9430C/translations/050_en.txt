　Among all types of active immunity, that achieved by cowpox vaccine approaches the most ideal vaccination method, but even in this case, immunity does not develop as quickly as one would hope. If we remove the time factor, cowpox vaccine satisfies all expectations; in addition to its reliable efficacy, cowpox vaccine possesses two qualities that belong to the first rank: it is harmless and its efficacy is permanent.
　Regarding vaccination with sera, even when using the most excellent among them, one cannot say much good. Even if the preventive effect is indisputable, even if it is harmless, its duration is temporary, and relying on it after 15 days would be imprudent.
　Among vaccines, there are some with lasting efficacy; these are those of heat-killed bacteria. However, when using these vaccines, there are often cases where one must pay such a sacrifice that one would rather wish to encounter the risk of contracting the disease than to undergo frequent prophylactic injections. This is particularly the case with typhus vaccines, where quite unpleasant complications often follow injection. Haffkine's plague vaccine does not receive favorable reviews as a milder remedy. Among these defects, particularly in laboratory animals, following injection of heated plague bacteria, by slightly exceeding the necessary amount, one often encounters severe toxic symptoms and sometimes death.

　To mitigate the results of vaccination methods using heated cultures, some scholars proposed adding small amounts of corresponding serum to dead bacteria. In such methods, one quickly recognized that this falls back into the example of passive serum immunity, which is not very lasting. Indeed, experiments showed that even though the mixture of dead bacteria and serum has the advantage of being harmless and showing as rapid action as the serum itself, conversely, it shares the following defects with serum: namely, the immunity conferred by these mixtures is extremely short-term and absolutely unacceptable as a practical method.
　However, it is possible to overcome these difficulties and obtain vaccines that are harmless and, to a certain degree, effective, rapid, and lasting.
　We see preparations approved under the name of sensitized "vaccines" "Vaccins Sensibilisée" in laboratory terminology.
　This appears in a report submitted to the Académie des sciences in 1902, where we summarized the results of our laboratory's first trials concerning plague, cholera, and typhus infections.
　Let us briefly state the principle underlying the preparation of these sensitized "vaccines."
　Since adding specific serum to bacterial bodies was recognized as harmful regarding the duration of immunity, we proposed using only serum from which proteins and other substances present in serum had been completely removed, except for specific substances.
　To realize this selection, there was of course no better means than using the bacteria themselves. Since the research of Ehrlich and Morgenroth, we know that all cells, particularly all bacteria, when brought into contact with their corresponding antibodies, bind with them, thus excluding all other substances contained in the serum.
　Bacteria that have thus bound antibodies no longer release them. It is useless to remove them from the serum in which the bacteria are immersed and wash them with physiological saline. The bacteria are considerably permeated with antibodies. These bacteria, which attract antibodies from serum to themselves and are, so to speak, stained by what we call specific sensitizing substances, form "Vaccins Sensiblisés" (sensitized "vaccines").

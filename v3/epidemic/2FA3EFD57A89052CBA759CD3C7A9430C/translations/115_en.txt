204　　　　　　Oral Immunization Against Dysentery, Typhus, and Cholera
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
Among 4,982 people who took the vaccine, there were 18 cholera patients (0.36%).
Among 11,004 non-users, there were 222 cholera patients (2.02%).

B. Villages where subcutaneous preventive injection was performed:
Among 8,485 injected persons, there were 31 cholera patients (0.37%).
Among 29,254 non-injected persons, there were 489 cholera patients (1.67%).

C. Villages where both vaccination methods were performed:
Among 3,085 bili-vaccine users, 15 cholera patients (0.49%).
Among 1,448 subcutaneous injection recipients, 6 cholera patients (0.41%).
Among 7,664 non-vaccinated persons, 160 cholera patients (2.1%).

Therefore, oral vaccination showed the same effectiveness as subcutaneous injection: in both groups of vaccine recipients, the number of cholera patients was about 5 times fewer than among non-vaccinated individuals.

Regarding typhus vaccination, there are already quite numerous reports at present.
We limit ourselves to reporting two recent epidemics during which bili-vaccine oral administration was performed: one in Poland, the other in Brazil.

From November 1923 to January 1927, over 60,000 typhus vaccinations were performed in the town of Łódź under the direction of sanitary inspector Starzynski. To report the effects of these vaccinations, particularly their long-term effects, accurate statistics are necessary; moreover, investigations of typhus patients, both among vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals, ceased on January 1, 1925. By this time, 28,166 people had received bile-added vaccine orally. Among this number, 52 typhus patients were recorded, classified as follows:

Residents of 151 houses receiving preventive oral treatment: 20,867 - 49 patients
People surrounding patients: 2,368 - 3 patients
Elementary school children: 3,500 - 0 patients
Volunteers: 807 - 0 patients
Police officers: 624 - 0 patients
―――――――――――――――――――――
Total: 28,166 - 52 patients

Among these 52 typhus patients, 3 occurred within the first week, i.e., during the incubation period,

and 6 occurred more than one year after vaccine administration, so these are excluded. The remaining 43 patients arose from the 28,166 oral vaccine recipients, representing 0.15%.

To determine the morbidity rate among non-recipients, the total population of all residences where even a single typhus patient occurred was calculated; this number was 73,494. Among this number, 993 typhus cases were identified, representing 1.35%.

Therefore, the morbidity rate among oral vaccine recipients was much lower than among non-recipients, with a definite 9-fold difference (1.35:0.15=9).

The above represents the vaccination effect considered as a whole. However, upon closer examination, conclusions transcending mere numbers appear even more effective.

Namely, when vaccination was implemented in the 151 suspect houses in question, 3,051 residents were absent; they were not vaccinated. Investigation of these latter individuals revealed that among the absent persons alone, 47 of the total 49 typhus cases recorded among the 28,166 residents occurred.

Another fact is no less important. Among the 151 households that accepted vaccination, only 27 had all residents without exception take the preventive oral treatment. The residents of these houses numbered 4,615. Among these, only 1 case of typhus occurred; what is further noteworthy is that in this person, the initial symptoms appeared within one week following vaccination.

Summarizing these observations spanning over two years, Starzynski stated the following conclusion: oral immunization with bile-added vaccine is completely harmless and forms a powerful weapon against typhus epidemics.

Let us describe the history of the epidemic that broke out in São Paulo, Brazil, at the beginning of 1925. This epidemic is particularly interesting because both subcutaneous injection and oral immunization methods were used during this outbreak.

Despite great efforts through printed materials to explain the benefits of the subcutaneous injection method, the majority of residents hesitated to comply: those prepared to undergo subcutaneous injection

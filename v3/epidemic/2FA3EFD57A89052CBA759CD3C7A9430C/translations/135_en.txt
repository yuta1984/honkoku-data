244　　　　　　　 Immunity and Antivirus

Animals subsequently become able to resist lethal doses of the corresponding virus; control animals that were vaccinated under the same conditions but without the addition of bile invariably died in the same test.

In humans, oral preventive vaccination against dysentery, cholera, and typhoid has already been implemented on a wide scale. Hundreds of thousands of people have been protected during epidemics, both in Europe and the Orient. Today this vaccination method is completely harmless, and the results recorded to date can be confirmed to be in no way inferior to those given by subcutaneous vaccination.

Regarding the mechanism of anti-typhoid or anti-cholera immunity, it is the same as in the case of dysentery: these immunities are completed entirely in the intestinal region. Typhoid or cholera antivirus liberated inside the intestine is adsorbed to the intestinal wall; these make the intestinal wall non-susceptible, thus rendering it harmless. This immunity of the intestine—the susceptible organ—is confused with immunity of the entire organism. This immunity is established without the cooperation of antibodies.

This is entirely the same in humans according to probability; in humans, no equilibrium exists between antibodies in the serum and the degree of immunity. People who have suffered cholera infection often have serum that is poor in antibodies, which does not prevent them from resisting new cholera infection; they resist even better than people who have been artificially immunized and whose blood is full of antibodies.

Similar phenomena are seen in the case of typhoid. Vaccination by the subcutaneous route results in the production of large quantities of antibodies; however, artificial immunity thus achieved is incomparable to immunity arising from actual typhoid infection, where this immunity persists for several years even though all traces of antibodies have long since disappeared from the blood.

Phenomena similar to those we have described have been recently observed by Lee Hazen of Columbia University in people immunized by the administration of ricin.

Ricin has a selective affinity for the intestine comparable to the affinity of typhoid, dysentery, or cholera bacilli; ricin also has an affinity for the skin that, though much milder, is reminiscent of that of staphylococci or streptococci.

Now, this dual susceptibility of ricin—to the intestine and skin—resulted as a necessary consequence in dual local immunity—true intestinal and skin immunity.

When rabbits were immunized via the rectal route and then tested via various routes—skin, vein, and rectum—the author confirmed that when lethal doses of ricin were injected, only animals tested rectally survived.

On the other hand, when rabbits were immunized percutaneously (intradermally) with a mixture of toxin and antitoxin, the author confirmed that immunity was established strictly localized to the site where the mixture was injected. When searching for antibodies in skin fragments that had been skin-immunized and in the serum of animals that had been intestinally immunized, the author could not find any trace of antibodies.

Anti-ricin immunity provides us with undeniable new evidence for the possibility of solid local immunity without generating antibodies.

The mechanism of immunity in tuberculosis remains mysteriously unclear today. However, what is beginning to be anticipated is this point: what completes immunity is probably located in fixed cellular sites, where antibodies appear completely foreign. Regarding the problem of healing mechanisms of tuberculous lesions, Bordet himself has stated, "We have not succeeded in establishing an extremely precise relationship between healing mechanisms and the manifestation of specific antibodies." It is not rare for us to demonstrate Bordet-Gengou antibodies in the blood of extremely advanced tuberculosis patients who are rapidly approaching death.

In the same vein, it should be recalled that in people injected with tubercle bacilli, antibodies appear in large quantities but there is not even a trace of immunity in the individual.

In summary, one can be supplied with large quantities of antibodies without obtaining immunity, and conversely: one can maintain equally solid immunity with poor or no antibodies at all—as is the case with past typhoid or cholera infections—and yet maintain no less solid immunity.

To avoid making this explanation too long, let us briefly describe what is known about immunity in two diseases caused by invisible viruses: smallpox and rabies.

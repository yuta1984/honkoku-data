　　　　　　　Bactericidal Power of Leukocytes
　　　Bactericidal Power of Leukocytes(1)
　For several years, numerous studies on the bactericidal power of blood, particularly
leukocytes, have been published. These studies aim to link immunity problems to the bactericidal action of fluids.
　In the authors' view, body fluids have the mission of participating in the disinfection of
living organisms, like disinfectants used externally.
　This purely humoral way of thinking appears superficial and simple, but it had the value
of generating numerous studies. Research on the bactericidal power of blood will require
much future development, therefore we will limit ourselves in this chapter to research on
the origin of bactericidal substances in serum.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　*　　*　　*
　Together with Emmerich and Tsuboi, who represent extreme currents in humoral theory, the
most authoritative representative of this theory is undoubtedly Buchner of Munich.
　Buchner considered the bactericidal power of serum as a vital phenomenon. Emmerich and
Tsuboi regarded it as a purely simple chemical reaction. According to them, the bactericidal
substance of serum is the serum protein serine. The disappearance of this substance upon
heating at 55° is explained by the following fact: namely, the complex molecule of serum
protein decomposes at this temperature and loses its alkaline element, and the alkaline
element becomes free and combines with the free oxygen present in the serum. The inability
to recover bactericidal power after heating is due to the chemical

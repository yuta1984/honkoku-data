virulence is not related.
　Staphylolysin preserved in an ice chamber with added carbolic acid glycerin retains its ability for several weeks or months. At room temperature, especially at incubator temperature, its ability rapidly weakens; under these conditions, this ability can completely disappear after 15 days. Against high temperatures, hemolysin acts like many bacterial toxins: heating at 48°C for 20 minutes markedly weakens it; heating at 56°C for the same duration completely destroys it.
　Like all bacterial hemolysins, the hemolysin secreted by staphylococci shows activity against the blood of numerous species. Rabbit blood cells are dissolved best; next are those of dogs, pigs, sheep, guinea pigs, and horses; human, goose, and goat blood cells are difficult to dissolve.
　Laboratory animals (rabbits, goats) are not indifferent to staphylolysin injection. Small amounts (for example, 0.2cc) are sufficient to cause fever and infiltration at the injection site. This infiltration continues for several days and is accompanied by hair loss and sometimes skin necrosis. Even when animals are covered with a kind of hardened shell toward the end of immunization, each new injection is accompanied by the same local symptoms. Certain animals, especially goats, have special susceptibility; they sometimes present symptoms of cachexia and die.
　Repeated injection of staphylolysin thereby conferred anti-hemolysin to the serum. Furthermore, certain normal sera have inhibitory ability against staphylolysin. This ability was recognized in human serum; it is particularly powerful in horse serum: 0.01cc of horse serum is sometimes sufficient to neutralize the action of the minimum amount of staphylolysin. This anti-hemolytic action of normal horse serum was already demonstrated by Kraus for numerous hemolytic bacteria; let us add that Ehrlich was the first to recognize this for tetanolysin.
　Regarding anti-hemolysins of normal serum or those produced by immunization methods, their properties are identical. Heating at 58°C for 30 minutes causes almost no change. This heat resistance inspired Neisser and Wechsberg to repeat a famous experiment of heating toxin-antitoxin mixtures. If this were a simple mixture, staphylolysin would be destroyed at 56°C, antistaphylolysin would not be destroyed, and the latter should be liberated by heating.

However, antitoxin is not liberated in this experiment. This appears to prove that it forms a true chemical bond that cannot be separated even by heating.
　Immunization with staphylolysin rendered inactive by heating does not form antibodies; therefore, heating appears not only to weaken staphylolysin but to completely destroy it.
　A noteworthy point is that subcutaneous immunization always forms anti-hemolysin, intravenous immunization gives poor results, and intraperitoneal injection does not form it at all.

　Pyocyanolysin, typholysin, and colilysin possess important common properties, namely they are not destroyed at high temperatures. Therefore, they are classified as one group and called thermostable bacteriolysins.
　Pyocyanolysin became the subject of numerous publications with results that were not always consistent. Bulloch and Hunter, who conducted the first detailed research, inoculated Pseudomonas aeruginosa of different origins into bouillon with peptone (1.5%) showing neutral reaction. At various intervals—7 to 34 days later—they investigated the hemolytic power of cultures that were either unfiltered but always sterilized with toluol or heating (60°C, 15 minutes). Their usual indicator was fresh defibrinated bovine blood. They were able to confirm that other blood cells (sheep, guinea pig) also dissolved after being placed in the incubator for various periods.
　According to Weingeroff's experiments, the blood cells that dissolve best with pyocyanolysin (filtered bouillon culture of 10-50 days) are those of dogs; next come those of horses, guinea pigs, and rabbits.
　The hemolytic power of Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture increases with the number of culture days. From this point, Bulloch and Hunter considered that young cultures completely lack pyocyanolysin. It was not only Margaret Breymann's opinion that hemolysin against sheep blood cells could already be demonstrated in 48-hour filtrates, but it is certain that only 3-4 week cultures give good results as pyocyanolysin. Old cultures are strongly al-

On the Japanese Translation
　At a time when our country is about to see the practical application of oral prophylactic methods and antivirus therapy, understanding where their theoretical foundations lie is extremely important for these research endeavors or their implementation. In understanding this, it is necessary to first listen to the explanations of Professor A. Besredka, the founder of local immunology, and explore the origins of this theory.
　For this purpose, the professor's work "Studies on Immunity in Infectious Diseases" is considered most suitable. This book uses the professor's experiments as the warp and those of numerous researchers as the weft, weaving together in a comprehensive yet plain and clear manner many important matters such as the evolution of immunological theory, the theory of local immunity, and its practical applications.
　The translator is one who once received instruction from this master at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Here I have obtained the permission of my mentor to translate this book into Japanese and have the honor of introducing it to the public, but being of shallow learning and meager talent, and with poor translation skills, I fear that I cannot adequately convey my mentor's true intentions.
　If I am fortunate enough to receive the tolerance of learned scholars and have the honor of their reading, then the translator's humble intentions toward his mentor will have been rewarded.

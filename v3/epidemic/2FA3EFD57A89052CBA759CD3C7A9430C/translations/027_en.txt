28　　　　　　　　Is There One or Multiple Types of Streptococci?

tocolysine has properties that cannot be confused with any other hemolysin; the majority of bacteria lose their hemolytic properties as soon as they are filtered.

　Now let us take a glance at the arguments drawn from studies of anti-streptococcal serum, particularly its agglutinating, protective, and complement-fixing properties.
　Whenever the morphological properties of a certain bacterium raise doubts about its identity, specific serum is extremely effective. For example, for various types of vibrios, we know no way to differentiate them other than by serum. Similar methods are frequently seen to be greatly utilized in the cases of typhus bacilli, dysentery bacilli, and colon bacilli. It is quite natural that the same should be attempted for streptococci.
　The agglutination reaction of streptococci was first advocated by Van de Velde. When immunizing horses with various streptococci, the author confirmed that the serum showed protective and agglutinating actions against the streptococci used, but had almost no such properties against other strains. This similarity was as if it demanded "whether there is a reliable and easy method to know whether a certain bacterium conforms to a certain serum in the agglutination reaction."
　The same idea was attempted by Tavel. We know today that these two properties—protective action and agglutinating action—are not common between them. Furthermore, we know today that the agglutinating action of streptococci is a markedly variable phenomenon. Van de Velde already recognized that the same streptococci agglutinate differently in different cases. He said, "This fact naturally deprives the agglutination reaction of most of its value as a standard for classification."
　This report was made in 1897, and it is particularly interesting because it was already recognized in this era that the agglutination reaction must be useful for the classification of streptococci.
　However, Meyer believed in 1902 that streptococci could be classified into two groups by agglutination reaction: in the first group, he placed angina streptococci (scarlet fever, rheumatism, simple angina); in the second group, he arranged streptococci causing purulent infec-

　This problem, which had been judged and seemed to have been completely cast into oblivion, was newly revived particularly following Moser's resonant report. The tendency to determine the specificity or non-specificity of scarlet fever streptococci has made us value numerous works, some of which are quite remarkable. These achievements bear the author names of Aronson, Neufeld, Weaver, Moser et v, Pirquet, Baginsky et Sommerfeld, Tavel, Wlassiewsky, Solge et Hasenknopf, Dopter, and others.
　It can be discerned that the main arguments made by these authors regarding the presence or absence of specificity of streptococci revolve around figures representing the agglutination titers of serum against various streptococci. Since the general conclusion derived from all these works, especially those favoring specificity, is that the agglutination reaction must solve this problem, we will not go into these details.
　Even though there are excerpts of a few clinical observations by Solge et Hasenknopf who recognized that patient serum agglutinated scarlet fever streptococci at a ratio of 1:150, we know nothing of other clinical facts of the same kind.
　Moser himself, in cooperation with v. Pirquet, examined the serum of 51 patients who had scarlet fever and the serum of the majority of other patients, and they concluded: "The agglutination reaction is seen more frequently in scarlet fever patients than in non-scarlet fever patients, and even more frequently in severe cases than in mild cases."
　Such a conclusion certainly does not provide strong proof of specificity. What should be added to this is merely that Baginsky et Sommerfeld, Weaver, and very recently Dopter have demonstrated negative results.
　The above is what has been learned clinically.
　Regarding the agglutination reaction of scarlet fever streptococci by serum of immunized animals, this does not become more favorable to their specificity either. It is sufficient to state one fact that many others have recognized; what we wish to cite is from Aronson's work. This author immunized one horse with scarlet fever patient streptococci and isolated streptococci from septicemia patients

6　　　　Bactericidal Power of Leukocytes
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
According to Vaughan and Kossel, it is the nuclear matter and nucleic acids that confer bactericidal action to leukocytes.
　In recent years, many reports on this problem have been published. Authors included Jacob, Löwit, and Schattenfroh. The research of these authors had the common point of being conducted on "extracts" obtained from leukocyte cell bodies.
　Jacob, who became well known through his research on leukocytes, employed the following method to prepare his extracts. To blood collected from the carotid artery, he added sodium carbonate at a rate of 0.5% and then added chloroform (1%). The mixture left in the incubation room for 24 hours was filtered through a filter. The filtrate with additional chloroform constituted the desired extract.
　It should be added that blood was sometimes collected in a state of leukopenia, sometimes in a state of leukocytosis. Each blood sample consisted of three parts: one part was used as is, another was used to obtain serum; the third part was used to prepare extracts.
Each of these parts was then comparatively studied from the viewpoint of protective action against lethal doses of pneumococci.
　To avoid going into details, what should be noted is that the conclusion these studies reached was that leukocyte extracts had greater action than serum; next, that whole blood had even greater action than serum itself.

In 1897, Löwit made a major publication on the relationship existing between leukemia and bactericidal power. Two problems were particularly studied there: first, whether leukocytes possess bactericidal power; second, if affirmative, whether it is possible to extract the substance manifesting this power in vivo.
　Instead of separating leukocytes from blood by filtration, following Denys' technique, Löwit performed extremely delicate surgery such as ligating the aorta immediately after exposing the brachiocephalic trunk. During this surgery, the experimenter constantly took care not to cause pulmonary edema. Measures had to be taken such as paralyzing the animal with curare, performing artificial respiration, and attending to the weakening heart. However

skillful the surgeon might be, even in the most fortunate cases, the animal lives only about 2 hours; often rabbits die immediately after surgery.
　Löwit recognized that after aortic ligation, whenever leukocytes fell below 800 per cubic millimeter, the bactericidal power of serum decreased markedly or even disappeared. Since this decrease was related to polynuclear leukocytes, Löwit concluded that it is polynuclear leukocytes that contain bactericidal substances. This conclusion is, by all probability, actually correct. Unfortunately, in this reality, besides leukopenia, violent phenomena occur such that the animal already dies by the second hour. As Löwit himself pointed out, the blood contains leukocyte fragments; the animal's body temperature drops to 29-25°. Therefore, in the atmosphere of such disturbance of the living body, it seems one should not conduct research to determine the precise relationship between the number or quality of leukocytes and their bactericidal power.
　To prepare leukocyte extracts, Löwit employed the following method: he separated leukocytes from other blood components as carefully as possible, then ground them with glass powder. He ground them until complete cells could no longer be recognized by microscopic examination, added physiological saline solution, and centrifuged the whole. The opalescent liquid obtained under such conditions was weakly alkaline, precipitated with acetic acid, and did not precipitate much with heat; it withstood 5 minutes of boiling; but what was particularly important was that its bactericidal power was extremely strong.
　According to Löwit, following Buchner's idea, this liquid was what leukocytes secrete in their physiological state. The opinion that Schattenfroh expressed in his recent publication - anyway based on experiments - differs from this, stating that Löwit's bactericidal substances come from the glass used for grinding leukocytes rather than from the leukocytes themselves.

　Schattenfroh's paper has value worthy of support, first for the precision the author brings to his experiments, and second because he marks a stage in the development of concepts regarding immunity. It is in this research that we see, for the first time among Buchner's disciples, an entire chapter devoted to the study of phagocytosis.

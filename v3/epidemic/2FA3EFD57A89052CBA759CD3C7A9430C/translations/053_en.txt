　Marie conducted research on rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs. He confirmed that rabies prophylactic "vaccines" work in the same manner as other sensitized "vaccines."
　Indeed, this vaccine is completely harmless; it can be injected directly into the brain without causing the slightest harm to the animal.
　Its action is rapid: animals vaccinated by this method become resistant to virus injected into the anterior chamber on the same day, the next day, or the day after prophylactic vaccination. Marie states: "One of the characteristics of this rabies prophylactic immunization method is its rapid formation. However, in Pasteur's prophylactic vaccination method, one must wait about 15 days after an extremely long series of injections before proving the animal's resistance. We see that this new therapeutic method confers extremely rapid immunity, because this immunity protects animals from rabies on the third day after injection of virulent pathogen as intense as injection into the anterior chamber."
　The immunity conferred by rabies prophylactic "vaccine" is permanent. According to Marie's experiments, guinea pigs and rabbits immunized by this method could resist intraocular testing for 6 months after "vaccine" inoculation. Two dogs inoculated in February 1904 resisted intraocular inoculation repeated twice in February and May 1905, one year later, while controls died.
　One of the considerable advantages of this method is that animals can be immunized against rabies with just a single injection. This fact was observed by Marie. This was also done by Remlinger. He was able to protect sheep by giving a single vaccine injection with a 3-day interval after ocular infection.
　In experiments with 3 dogs, Marie confirmed that these animals, given a single subcutaneous inoculation, immediately resisted injection of rabies virus into the anterior chamber, while similarly injected controls died of paralytic rabies.
　The immunity conferred by rabies prophylactic sensitized "vaccine" is solid, as seen from the fact that immunized animals also resist intraocular testing; this infection method is known to be more severe than bites from rabid animals.
　Simply put, in rabies prophylactic sensitized "vaccines" we also recognize the properties we have already proven in other vaccines of the same type:

that is, absolutely harmless with reliable, rapid, and persistent action.
　This sensitized "vaccine" was used for prophylactic treatment of rabies in humans. "1g of medulla oblongata from passage rabbits (fixed virus) is finely ground and placed in 9cc of diluted 'bouillon' or physiological saline to make a suspension, which is filtered through 'linen.' To 2cc of this 10-fold dilution is added 4cc of sheep anti-rabies serum previously heated at 56° for 30 minutes. This 6cc mixture"—containing excess virus—"is inoculated subcutaneously in two places on the abdomen. Similar injections are repeated for 3 consecutive days. Thereafter, from the 6th day, the patient receives inoculation of dried spinal cord."
　Since 1904, many bite victims have been treated by this method, and the results were, according to Marie, excellent. In his opinion, this method should be applied especially when patients come for treatment long after being bitten, as well as for all severe bite cases.

　Due to the kinship relationship existing between "typhus" bacteria and dysentery bacteria, and the importance that prophylactic vaccination against dysentery shows in human cases, it was natural to consider dysentery prophylactic sensitized "vaccines." Dopter, who contributed considerably to dysentery treatment methods, also made contributions to prophylactic measures.
　It is well known that prophylactic vaccination of small laboratory animals against dysentery bacteria by ordinary methods is quite difficult. Even if immunity appears, it never appears before 12-15 days. When attempting to prophylactically vaccinate "mice," at least 40 to 50 "percent" are lost during the course of prophylactic vaccination.
　Injection of heated dysentery bacteria presents quite severe local and systemic symptoms. In surviving "mice," symptoms cause only temporary edema at the injection site and mild emaciation. In rabbits, marked inflammatory edema, temperature elevation, and severe, rapid emaciation are observed.
　The immunity obtained is short in duration; immunity hardly extends beyond 4 to 6 weeks. However, a point requiring further attention is that during the immune process, animals become more susceptible to infection than control animals. Therefore, during epidemics, prophylactic measures using heated cultures

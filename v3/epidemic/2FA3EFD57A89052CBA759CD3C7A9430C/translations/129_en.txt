232　　　　　　　　　Dressings and Immunity　　　　　　
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
The cells of our tissues have almost no risk of losing their vitality when brought into contact with pressure bandages or instruments; the body as a whole can carry out all the defensive actions that endow the organism with its natural immunity.

However, asepsis has a vulnerable aspect. Since asepsis stops active fighting against infection, its great concern is "primum non nocere" (first, do no harm), and it is left to natural healing powers. Moreover, asepsis has no effect unless it is in a perfect state. Major surgery had to be performed according to strict aseptic protocols requiring special places where even the smallest nests of dust were removed. Since this becomes a cause of accidental infection, assistants, operations, and even conversation must be kept to a minimum. The shorter the surgical time, the better the success. However, if for any reason these conditions cannot be realized, results more concerning than aseptic surgery may result: in this case, it is inferior. Finally, there are contraindications for aseptic bandages: this is when pathogenic bacteria exist in large numbers.

The purpose of bactericidal bandages is to directly and completely destroy bacteria. Understanding how necessary it is to consider cellular vitality, bacterial destruction was relegated to secondary plans, and focus was placed on natural healing power, that is, the natural immunity of tissues.

However, this immunity, which engages in the most active defensive measures, can be made even stronger by artificial elements and becomes an extremely valuable element in wound treatment in the hands of surgeons. We intend to describe specific bandages. These bandages are based on sera or antiviruses.

Bandages based on specific sera have hardly entered universal practice. Their use is based on experiments conducted at that time with anti-tetanus serum.

These experiments showed that local anti-tetanus immunity could be obtained. Nothing is simpler than this: one need only apply a pressure bandage soaked with anti-tetanus serum to the shaved skin of a guinea pig, or smear the abdominal skin with tetanus antitoxin mixed in lanolin.

By either of these methods, animals are protected against certain lethal doses of tetanus toxin.

The bandage protects against this when applied the day before toxin injection or within 3 hours after toxin injection—guinea pigs are seen to be protected against fatal tetanus.

For anti-tetanus serum bandages to be effective, it is necessary to bring them into direct contact with the site that received the toxin. When applied to abdominal skin, the bandage protects against toxin injected subcutaneously in the abdomen: it does not protect against toxin injected subcutaneously elsewhere, for example, in one leg.

In other words, the immunity realized by anti-tetanus bandages is local; it is strictly specific.

This local vaccination (loco loeso - at the site of injury) can in many cases substitute for anti-tetanus serum injection. This method offers the advantage of bringing none of the inconveniences—direct or indirect—that result from parenteral invasion of heterologous serum.

Bandages based on vaccines or antiviruses see extremely numerous applications in surgical practice. Their action, though local, presents an extremely wide field of application. This relates to a kind of specific element. This specificity has dual significance: on one hand, they are directed against viruses, preventing viral development, and on the other hand—and this is a particularly valuable advantage—they are directed toward the body's cells, enhancing resistance. This dual action combines the advantages of bactericidal and aseptic bandages without expressing any inconvenience. Using these specific bandages strengthens the natural immunity of skin and mucous membranes, exactly as in cutaneous vaccination against anthrax or oral vaccination against typhus. The biological bactericidal action filled with antivirus is enhanced by the action it performs on cells.

The ubiquity of staphylococci and streptococci has led to numerous applications of specific bandages in infections of the skin and mucous membranes.

In furuncles, carbuncles, abscesses of all kinds, puerperal fever, and other diseases, bandages with antiviruses have come to be widely used; this need not be argued here. What was often seen during the war, due to major injuries,

214　　　　　　Role of Mordants in Infection and Immunity

it was sufficient to merely change the conditions of intestinal permeability. Since its inherent toxicity is zero, it is certainly not bile itself that produces this result. If the animal's natural immunity is broken, this is because bile creates damaged areas in the intestinal mucosa; this damage, even at a microscopic level, is sufficient for bacteria to reach susceptible cells. Local lesions caused by bile have repercussions on the general manifestation of infection mechanisms: namely, whatever the portal of entry of the virus, whether the virus is swallowed or injected into the blood, the final result is always the same. The action of bile, in our opinion, lies mainly in its cholagogue action. When the animal's own secretion is strengthened, bile facilitates the detachment of the intestinal epithelial layer and makes the intestine more permeable. Then, bacteria attracted to the intestine by their affinity can create infectious foci there, which no one would oppose; the disease can initially be local, then take on the character of septicemic symptoms.

Let us summarize this: the integrity of the intestinal mucosa of healthy animals ensures natural immunity against typhus bacilli; damage to the mucosa by bile causes partial loss of this immunity. In other words, in physiological states, the animal's resistance or susceptibility to the virus in question depends on what the intestinal barrier accomplishes.

It is not only bacteria of the typhus-paratyphus group that exert the action we have shown. It is entirely conceivable that bile would similarly play an inductive role against cholera vibrios. We had our co-author Masaki engage in research in this direction.

In his initial experiments, the author observed that there are indeed similarities between cholera infection and typhus-paratyphus infection. This similarity was found in the anatomical location of lesions, the distribution of vibrios in the organism, and the animal's response to swallowed bile.

In guinea pigs and rabbits inoculated subcutaneously with cholera virus, Masaki was able to confirm that vibrios appeared in the intestinal mucosa sites already 2-3 hours after injection. That vibrios become extremely numerous in the intestinal tract after 10 hours is proven by culture.

Therefore, it is certain that vibrios have marked affinity for the intestinal wall. However, despite this affinity, animals suffer no disorder at all even when swallowing extremely large amounts of vibrios: experimental creation of intestinal-type cholera in mature animals always failed, just as with typhus-paratyphus infections. Even when guinea pigs and rabbits were kept hungry for a long time and then made to swallow amounts of live vibrios corresponding to 1-2 agar cultures from Roux flasks, this was futile, and they felt no symptoms whatsoever. Vibrios that entered the digestive tract slide down along the intestinal mucosa and are then expelled without coming into close contact with intestinal cells for even a moment.

Such matters do not follow the same course in pre-sensitized animals. The amounts of cholera bacilli we mentioned above severely attack rabbits that had previously swallowed ox bile. For the first 3-4 days after ingesting the bacteria, the animals show no apparent symptoms of illness externally. Only their behavior suggests they might be harboring disease: the animals remain motionless in their cages, as if any movement would cause pain. As soon as such symptoms, undoubtedly indicating infection, appear, body temperature rises, feces become diarrheal, appetite disappears, and rapid emaciation occurs. Generally, death comes suddenly in a state of cachexia in the 2nd-3rd week. During autopsy and culture, none of the swallowed bacteria are found, clearly because the vibrios dissolved during the long course of illness.

These observations were made on rabbits. Recently, results as clear as Masaki's were described for guinea pigs by Horowitz-Wlassowa and Pirojnikowa. The authors succeeded in sensitizing guinea pigs with ox bile and causing intestinal cholera in them per os.

Similarly, citing our experiments on infected rabbits, Klukhine and Wigodchikoff caused both typhus and cholera infections via the oral route.

These show that animals easily contract the relevant diseases when in the special state of being pre-sensitized with ox bile.

Similar facts have been described for other viruses. Our co-author Golovanov recognized the promoting action of bile in rabbits subjected to oral infection with E. coli

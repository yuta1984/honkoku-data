cannot be done, but let us describe the general sequence regarding this.
These authors, taking hints from German achievements, particularly those of the Pfeiffer school, sought their research in bacteriolysins. When they compared the sera of animals treated with ordinary vibrios and sensitized vibrios, they confirmed that in the latter case, bacteriolytic antibodies appeared more rapidly.
They conducted other verifications, which from our perspective were more important, dealing with immunity in vivo. What can be concluded from their experiments is that with intravenous injection, when sensitized vaccines are used, animals can withstand infection with lethal doses of vibrios already six hours after vaccination, whereas non-sensitized cholera vibrios only confer immunity after 24 hours under the same conditions.
As the authors rightly acknowledge, this early appearance of immunity is a point not to be underestimated from the standpoint of practical problems, since measures during major epidemics are almost always necessary.
In the case of sensitized vibrios, in addition to the vaccine reactions being extremely mild, this advantage gives sensitized vaccines superiority over ordinary vaccines.
According to these authors, sensitized vaccines are 1) rapidly and easily absorbed by the organism, and 2) hardly stimulate tissues and reactions from them are not significant; equally favorable conditions reduce the duration of the negative phase. However, this negative phase has not been established in the case of cholera, as will be seen later.
Before describing the application of cholera preventive vaccines, let us summarize where we have described the various processes related to this problem from an experimental standpoint.
It was Ferran himself who conceived the idea of vaccinating humans against cholera. It was Haffkine himself who incorporated this into the scope of known facts of the problem and performed vaccination on an extensive scale. Both used live curved bacteria.
R. Pfeiffer, having demonstrated bactericidal capacity in serum, used heated bacterial bodies instead of live bacteria.

Metchnikoff clarified the mechanism of cholera preventive immunity; he brought the significance of bacteriolysins back to actual proportion and proved that the presence of this substance is hardly sufficient to protect against intestinal cholera.

The problem of cholera vaccination appears in a completely different form when viewed from the standpoint of experimental results. While bacteriologists were discussing the norms of immunity, while they acknowledged the value of subcutaneous injection but ultimately did not attribute full value to it, epidemiologists continued to utilize each new innovation added to vaccine production. They collected and pursued sufficient material in terms of abundance and importance.
Certainly, the initial statistics did not gain conviction by nature. Some said this, but hesitated to discuss it in detail. However, all these statistics provided characteristics that were not lacking in what should be advantageous in the future. This was their uniformity. Whether epidemics occurred in small areas or densely populated places, whether epidemics were severe or mild, whether epidemics were in India, Persia, or Russia, the attack rate was always lower among the vaccinated than among the unvaccinated. Nothing ever challenged this rule as an exception.
Even though chance was initially claimed, as vaccination techniques improved, this doubt increasingly narrowed in scope. That is, the effects of vaccination gradually became undeniably pervasive.

The first epidemiological observation recorded with the desired sufficient accuracy was that of Haffkine. For reasons of historical interest, let us describe one of them.
An epidemic broke out in the Gaïa prison in India. It was decided to vaccinate the prisoners there. Since experience with the new method was still limited, it was implemented on only half to allow them to receive the benefits.

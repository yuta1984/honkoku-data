We find detailed descriptions of this problem in Celsus's famous work "De re medica." According to Celsus's opinion, an "abscess" should be incised and its contents aspirated until all putrid matter existing there is removed. Later in the 19th century, surgeon Bier made this method his own.

With the arrival of Christian civilization, we had to await the renewal of surgery. It was nothing: "Ecclesia abhorret a sanguine" (The Church abhors blood). We should also add that due to this aversion that the church harbored toward bloodshed, surgery atrophied throughout the entire medieval period. Those barber-surgeons could not be more knowledgeable than their colleagues from the early Christian era. However, the only meritorious figure recorded in history is the 14th-century French surgeon Mondeville, who had the courage to oppose the leading Galenists of his time and establish that suppuration was essential for wound healing, and that wounds actually form scars better when they do not have pus. Only Mondeville had his own views.

"Pomades" and plasters continued to be favorably discussed for suppuration and wound surfaces. Contaminated dressings were sanctified by Galenic doctrine; overturning their position was beyond individual power.

The Renaissance came. Ambroise Paré, the most representative surgeon of the time, published his famous "Treatise on Wounds from Firearms." He did not hesitate to condemn the cauterization with red-hot iron or boiling oil that was popular at the time. In his opinion, this method, which took its "hint" from fear of infection, only worsened the surgical course due to damage to the tissues where it was applied. He recommended treating complicated wounds by repeatedly washing the affected area with wine or eau-de-vie (similar to "absinthe") or copper sulfate solution. Paré was the first to realize the importance of not placing tissues in a deteriorated state, but allowing tissues to preserve their maximum vitality and maximum defensive capabilities. He was also the one who used antiseptics before the literature

on the subject existed (1).

Ambroise Paré's ideas were not understood. Among the few enthusiastic supporters, the famous 18th-century surgeon J.-L. Petit rejected the barbers' cauterization method and substituted dressings with turpentine, myrrh, and "quinquina" powder. However, to summarize, surgery in this era made no more progress than at the beginning of the Christian era.

"Pomades" and poultices did not leave the realm of surgery until the middle of the 19th century. Furthermore, seduced by Broussais's opinions on local inflammation, surgeons became accustomed to bleeding large amounts from both the injured and surgical patients, just like physicians. They placed patients in such a weakened state that even such minimal surgery became a pretext for infection. Post-operative mortality rates reached such proportions that they made even the most skilled surgeons abandon taking up the "scalpel" again. Even prayers that "purulent inflammation" - which should be described as black series - would not occur could not prevent the unfortunate results of surgery.

1867 arrived. The concept of easily transmissible infection brought by surgeons, instruments, or dressings opened new territories. Like a transformation under a magician's wand, surgical technique was completely changed.

"New treatment of compound fractures and abscesses; observations on the causes of suppuration" - a memorable report with this title was published by Lister. The issue of wound dressing with carbolic acid water or carbolic acid in oil spread widely.

This first publication passed without much recognition. Also, after a while, Lister judged it necessary to publish a new report. This time, he gave it an extremely simple title: "The Significance of Antiseptics" - he intended to fully indicate that this had nothing to do with anything other than the new policy that attempted to impress the new dressing method upon surgery.

To convince his contemporaries, he cited the medical histories of many important operations that his technique had led to better results.

226　　　　　　Role of Mordants in Infection and Immunity

and establish their natural immunity in animals; this immunity is solid as long as the surface of the integument remains healthy.

In order to give artificial immunity to animals, and further to cause infection in animals that are congenitally resistant, it is important that this integument first receives appropriate mordant action, which, though only extremely mild, makes the natural safety fragile.

　　　　　　　　　Dressings　　and　　Immunity
　　　　　　　　　　　Pansements et Immunité
The development of dressing methods in surgery (hereinafter referred to as medicated bandages) is based on successful considerations in medicine based on better means to overcome disease. The main processes that transitioned to medicated bandages—whether bactericidal, antiseptic, or specific—were all derived from the idea of destroying pathogenic bacteria. What differs among these various medicated bandages is their method of action. This latter method of action derives sometimes from the humoral theory of immunity, sometimes from the cellular theory, or from the theory of specific tissue local immunity.

The first medicated bandages of the crude era of surgery date back to the Stone Age. These are said to have been used by prehistoric humans to perform perforations with flint or to extract arrows buried in flesh. Everything was good: tree bark, grass found at hand, squid ink, etc. The key point was to quickly stop bleeding and close the wound surface. Ritualistic gestures did not much complete the effect of the dressing, as in the case of Ulysses as Homer believed.

When injured in the leg by a wild boar during hunting at Autolycus, he saw his surgeon finish his work while chanting spells for a long time while ligating the injured leg.

Five centuries before our time, Hippocrates' work often dealt with fractures, injuries, and medicated bandages; but unfortunately, regarding their components or methods of use, we completely lack details.

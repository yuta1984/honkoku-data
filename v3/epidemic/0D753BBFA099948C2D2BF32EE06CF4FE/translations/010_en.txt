This is because from early summer to late autumn, people's undergarments become loose and their pores open and do not contract properly, making them susceptible to external pathogenic influences. However, during hot weather, even if one is affected by external pathogens, people do not consider it particularly serious. At first, they merely feel heavy, experience fatigue in hands and feet, or suffer headaches and loss of appetite, dismissing these symptoms as heat stroke or seasonal ailments without any fear. Unknowingly, they accumulate pathogenic influences on top of existing ones, and eventually develop this disease.

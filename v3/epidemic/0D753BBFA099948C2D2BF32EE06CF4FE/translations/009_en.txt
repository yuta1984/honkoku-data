Korori (Cholera personified)
〇Old man
Brother, you don't need to worry so much. Japan is a big country, so there are probably still many fools who sleep in light clothing, overeat and go straight to bed, or take naked afternoon naps - those people will surely be possessed (by cholera) immediately.

Master of the house
〇Ah, sake is delicious, and side dishes are delicious too. Life is the foundation of everything. From now on, don't forget to wear your undershirt and belly warmer every night. And we should never eat rotten food or hard-to-digest things. If we do that, no matter what disease spreads, my life will be safe.

Anyone who dies from cholera must be quite foolish, don't you think, wife?

Wife
〇Yes, yes, you're absolutely right. And don't forget to check the color of your urine every morning. If there's even a slight discoloration, go see a doctor immediately.

〇Damn it, these guys have recently become aware and started taking precautions against catching cold while sleeping with belly warmers and undershirts. Now our work will probably be ruined. Perhaps we should just flee to India.

Namaishi (Disease god)
〇If there's even a slight discoloration (in the urine), go see a doctor immediately, yes, yes.

Child
〇Father, if I die, I won't be able to eat delicious food anymore, so please let me wear an undershirt starting tonight too.

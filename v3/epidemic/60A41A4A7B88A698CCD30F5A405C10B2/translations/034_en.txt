4. Excreta such as feces and urine should be placed in empty petroleum cans with handles attached, suspended on a tripod, with heat applied from below and stirred occasionally. At that time, the content should appropriately be about one-third from the bottom. If the excreta is small in amount or lacks moisture, water should be added as appropriate.

5. All boiling time should continue for at least thirty minutes after boiling begins.

(D) Steam disinfection: This can be called the king among disinfection methods, and for this, a steam disinfector is used. The matters requiring attention at that time are as follows:

1. Items suitable for steam disinfection... clothing, bedding, cloth pieces, glassware, ceramics, wooden products, metal products, etc.

2. Items unsuitable for steam disinfection... leather goods, lacquerware, rubber products, glued items, items with animal glue, fur, ivory, tortoiseshell, horn materials, various types of excreta, etc.

3. Clothing should be searched beforehand, and when there are items that explode or ignite easily such as ammunition or matches, these should be removed.

4. Unclean items or items that may stain other objects during disinfection should not be loaded together with clean items.

5. When loading many clothes etc. that are tightly bundled and wrapped, there is a risk that steam penetration will be insufficient, so it is better for the loading of items to be disinfected to be as loose and sparse as possible.

6. When placing items to be disinfected in the disinfector, one should wear disinfection clothing and attend to the task. After carrying them in, the hands should immediately be disinfected with carbolic acid water, and then the lid should be closed. When disinfection is completed, one should wear clean disinfection clothing and remove items with disinfected hands.

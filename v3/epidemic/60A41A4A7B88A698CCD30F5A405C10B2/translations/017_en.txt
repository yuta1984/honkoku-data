(vesicant fluid) and the other is a bacterial solution made by mixing typhoid bacilli with saline solution at a fixed ratio (the so-called typhoid diagnostic solution). When these two fluids are mixed in various proportions in a test tube, if typhoid bacilli agglutinate and present a flocculent appearance, this is called a positive Widal reaction, and the patient is diagnosed with typhoid fever. If, on the contrary, the typhoid bacilli do not agglutinate, it is a negative Widal reaction and the patient is determined not to have typhoid fever. This reaction usually appears 7 to 10 days after onset of illness, but it may appear as early as the second day. The time required for this test is 3 to 24 hours.

(2) Culture test: Usually, the patient's feces, urine, or blood is collected and cultured to examine the presence or absence of typhoid bacilli. This test requires 3-4 days. If typhoid bacilli are found as a result of the test, it is clear that the patient's disease is typhoid fever. However, although excretion of these bacilli in feces may be observed within 5 days after onset of illness, they appear in the greatest quantity in the second and third weeks after onset. In urine, they may appear at the end of the first week or after the second week, but they mostly come during the recovery period and thereafter. Since typhoid bacilli exist most abundantly in the blood during the first week of illness, positive results may be obtained through blood culture even before the "Widal" reaction has yet appeared.

The above two types of tests can be performed at any time by the prefectural hygiene department, so when necessary, vesicant fluid and feces/urine should be collected from the patient (blood should be collected by a police physician making a house call), placed in clean small bottles with tight stoppers, sealed with sealing wax or similar materials, and placed in a sturdy container (with a bottom

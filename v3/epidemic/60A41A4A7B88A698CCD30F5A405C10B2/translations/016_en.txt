Bowel movements are irregular; in the early stage they are mostly normal or slightly constipated, but from the end of the first week or beginning of the second week, more than half of patients develop diarrhea (2-3 to 4-5 times per day). The nature of the stool is characteristic, presenting as thin, pale yellow (pea soup-like stool).

Second week: Body temperature reaches 39-40 degrees Celsius and remains constant. The pulse is slow relative to the fever, remaining around 90-100 even with a fever of 40 degrees. Patients present with an apathetic facial expression and may experience hearing impairment. They may suffer from insomnia or conversely fall into somnolence, occasionally uttering delirious speech. They also almost always develop bronchial catarrh and coughing.

Third week: The fever shows marked morning-evening variation (one to two degrees or more). Various symptoms gradually subside and patients feel improvement, but in severe cases, cardiac weakness, intestinal bleeding, or perforative peritonitis may occur during this period,

resulting in death.

Fourth week: All symptoms further diminish, and by the end of this week, the fever finally disappears.

Fifth week: Body temperature becomes 36-36.5 degrees Celsius, appetite increases, and physical strength improves.

Diagnosis: When the above signs are complete, diagnosis is easy, but in the early stages when the characteristic features of this disease have not yet appeared, or in mild cases, clinical diagnosis is almost impossible. In such cases, bacteriological diagnosis must be relied upon, as follows:

(1) Widal reaction (agglutination reaction) test: The Widal reaction is so named because the person who first performed this test was Dr. Widal. Two things are required for this examination. One is the fluid obtained by applying a vesicating plaster to the patient's upper arm or chest.

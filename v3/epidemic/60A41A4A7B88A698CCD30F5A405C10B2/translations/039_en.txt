In addition, there are other disinfectants such as 1:1000 mercuric chloride solution (1 part mercuric chloride, 10 parts hydrochloric acid, 989 parts water), green soap or potassium soap, formaldehyde, etc., but their details are omitted here.

Degree of Disinfection According to Disease Type

Since pathogens each differ in their characteristics, the location of disease toxins varies by disease. Therefore, the areas and degree of disinfection must also change accordingly. The following standards are presented below.

(A) Degree of disinfection for cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and paratyphoid

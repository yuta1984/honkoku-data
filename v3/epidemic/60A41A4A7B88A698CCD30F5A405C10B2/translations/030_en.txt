If serum cannot be obtained, regrettably there is nothing to do but stand by helplessly and watch the sick child proceed to death. Therefore, there is no other way to save them except for each town and village office to purchase and store serum in normal times.

6. The reason serum injection leads to cure is because the serum components neutralize the toxins produced by diphtheria bacteria, not because they kill the diphtheria bacteria. Therefore, even after serum injection, the bacteria still survive harmlessly in the affected area for a certain period. However, since infectivity still exists, it can certainly infect others.

7. After serum injection, sometimes as early as one or two days or as late as one or two weeks later, rashes may appear, or rarely joint pain, muscle pain, etc., may develop with slight temperature elevation as side effects. However, these symptoms usually disappear within one or two days and are definitely not dangerous.

8. When a patient occurs, investigate whether there was previously a diphtheria patient in that house, or whether there was recent contact with a diphtheria patient, or whether there was contact with items used by a diphtheria patient, and whether family members, especially the mother, have pharyngitis, etc., to clarify the chain of infection.

9. Were there any visitors to the patient's house (especially children) after the patient became ill? If so, attention must be paid to their subsequent health condition.

10. If one wishes to reliably prevent infection of the patient's family members, especially healthy children, diphtheria serum preventive injection should be administered. However, its effective period is only two to three weeks.

11. Diphtheria patients should be isolated and, if possible, dedicated caregivers should be assigned.

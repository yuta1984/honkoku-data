Intestinal pathological changes: When a person is invaded by typhoid bacilli, these bacilli primarily cause pathological changes in the mucous membrane of the lower part of the small intestine and the cecum (right lower abdomen), etc. Specifically, these areas become congested and swollen in the first week of onset, develop eschars in the second week, and the eschars slough off to form ulcers in the third week. In the fourth week, the ulcers begin to heal, and by the fifth week (recovery period), they are completely healed, leaving scars.

Symptoms: Although there are significant differences depending on the severity of the disease, in moderate cases they are roughly as follows:

Incubation period: Short cases: 5-6 days; long cases: 2-3 weeks; usually 10-14 days

Prodromal symptoms: General or limb fatigue, exhaustion, loss of appetite, back pain, headache, tinnitus, nosebleeds, mostly constipation

First week of onset: Begins with chills and fever. Headache, dizziness, general or limb fatigue, back pain, stabbing pain in the left upper abdomen, restless sleep, lack of appetite, tongue coating present. Body temperature rises in a step-like pattern daily, reaching 39-40 degrees Celsius by the end of the first week. Important signs of this disease, namely splenic enlargement and rose spots, also appear at the end of the first week or beginning of the second week. Rose spots appear on the chest and abdomen. The abdomen is somewhat distended, with tenderness and rumbling sounds in the right lower abdomen.

Since these bacteria are excreted, urination outside of toilets should be prohibited as much as possible. However, dysentery patients and those recovering from dysentery do not excrete dysentery bacteria in their urine, therefore there is no need to disinfect urine.

(11) Since knowing the degree of pathogen spread after patient occurrence is necessary for prevention, at least the following items must be investigated and appropriate preventive measures must be taken:
　(A) What is the health condition of family members after patient occurrence?
　(B) After the patient fell ill, did the patient and family members visit other homes, or did others come to the patient's home?
　(C) If so, did they consume food and drink, use toilets, or exchange goods during such visits?
　(D) How were the patient's excretions disposed of?
　(E) Did anyone use the rivers, moats, wells, etc. that were used at the patient's home?

(12) As a result of the above investigation, if houses, wells, toilets, etc. other than the patient's home are contaminated or suspected of contamination with pathogens, it goes without saying that disinfection should be carried out.

(13) If there are people who had contact with the patient's home, disinfection methods should be applied to their clothing, tableware, etc., and appropriate surveillance should be conducted for at least ten days for dysentery and twenty days for typhoid and paratyphoid.

(14) Ditches contaminated with pathogens should be disinfected, and the use of rivers (including swimming, of course) should be prohibited for a certain period.

(15) After patient discovery, health surveillance or health examinations should be conducted for approximately two weeks for the patient's home, and for a certain period for the surrounding area as well.

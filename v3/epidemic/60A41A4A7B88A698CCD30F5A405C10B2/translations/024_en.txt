(1) Implementation of sanitation practices: Pay attention to cleanliness of houses and their surroundings, particularly the construction of toilets and wells, prevent pathogens from infiltrating soil and water, dredge ditches and ensure proper sewage flow (complete water supply and sewage systems would naturally be ideal). Also frequently clean stables to prevent fly breeding (for flies that have already appeared, implement fly-catching methods and use mosquito net covers to protect food from fly attacks).

(2) Pay attention to physical health: Colds and gastrointestinal disorders often become triggers for infectious disease infection, therefore it is necessary to pay sufficient attention regularly to maintain physical health. That is, in daily life, especially when approaching epidemic periods, not only drinking water but also water used for gargling or washing dishes must be boiled once before use, and it is safe to eat only food that has been cooked or grilled.

Furthermore, it is advisable to avoid eating and drinking as much as possible during funeral gatherings. This is because outbreaks of infectious diseases frequently occur suddenly due to eating and drinking at funeral gatherings. If drinking water contains many impurities, it is good to use water that has been filtered through a water filter and then boiled (Figure 7).

(3) Promote the development of general hygiene awareness through hygiene exhibitions, hygiene lectures, or magic lantern shows.

(4) Take measures against bacterial carriers
After outbreaks of typhoid or dysentery have once subsided, they often reoccur after intervals of several weeks to several months, and in many cases the route of transmission is unclear. This is mainly because bacterial carriers serve as the source, therefore disinfecting the excreta of bacterial carriers during normal times is essential for epidemic prevention

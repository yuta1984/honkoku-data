Of course there is an obligation [to report], but if there are points similar to typhoid yet it cannot be definitively determined to be typhoid, it is advisable to report it as a patient requiring attention while simultaneously implementing early diagnosis methods and having the patient carry out disinfection measures as a precaution.

(5) Early diagnosis of infectious disease patients is extremely important for preventing their spread. If clinical determination is difficult, it is necessary to collect rash fluid, urine (typhoid, paratyphoid), and feces (typhoid, paratyphoid, dysentery) for bacteriological examination to confirm the diagnosis.

(6) When a patient develops, one must investigate at least back to before onset - three weeks prior for typhoid and paratyphoid, eight days prior for dysentery - examining the following matters to determine transmission routes

and thereby implement appropriate preventive disinfection methods:

(A) Were there recently any sick persons or deaths in the patient's household? If so, what were the dates of onset and symptoms?

(B) Did the patient and family members have direct or indirect contact with households having infectious disease patients or suspected cases, or those that previously had such cases, or with areas where infectious diseases were prevalent? If so, did they eat or drink there, use toilets, or receive goods?

(C) Did the patient or family members use rivers, drainage channels, wells, etc. suspected of pathogenic contamination?

Even conducting such investigations, there are many cases where transmission routes cannot be identified from recent facts. This is due to insufficient investigation

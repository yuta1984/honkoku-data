According to the above definition, anything called an infectious disease must necessarily have a specific microorganism as its cause. However, in reality, there are diseases where the fact of transmission is evident, yet their pathogens have still not been discovered. Nevertheless, since it is expected that the pathogens of these diseases will eventually be discovered, they are currently included among infectious diseases despite their unknown etiology.

Legally Designated Infectious Diseases
　Nine legally designated infectious diseases　Those with known pathogens... typhoid, paratyphoid, dysentery, cholera, diphtheria (including croup), plague
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Those with unknown pathogens... smallpox, typhus, scarlet fever

Classification of Bacteria
　Bacteria　1. Cocci... such as pyogenic bacteria and gonococci
　　　　　　2. Bacilli... such as typhoid bacillus and dysentery bacillus  
　　　　　　3. Spirilla... such as cholera vibrio and relapsing fever spirochetes

Bacterial Life
　Essential requirements for bacterial life include food, moisture, air (with exceptions), and other substances similar to what we consume, as well as a specific temperature (human body temperature being optimal). Therefore, when nutritive substances such as milk, broth, or potatoes are placed in test tubes and maintained at a constant temperature, bacteria can be artificially cultivated and multiplied—this is called culture. When various types of bacteria are cultured in this manner, each exhibits its characteristic growth pattern, which serves as a powerful aid in bacterial identification.

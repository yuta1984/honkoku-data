Predisposing factors: Gastrointestinal diseases, colds, physical and mental overexertion, etc.

Reservoirs of typhoid bacilli: 1. Typhoid patients  2. Typhoid bacillus carriers  3. Excreta

There are three types of typhoid carriers as follows:
(A) Those who excrete the bacillus in feces and urine for several weeks after recovery from typhoid (in feces, there are cases where the bacillus does not disappear for as long as three and a half years or several years or more; in urine, it has been detected for seven months)
(B) Those with mild typhoid cases that passed without clinical diagnosis of typhoid being possible, who excrete the bacillus (mild typhoid is particularly common in children)
(C) Those who are completely healthy yet excrete the bacillus

Excreta: The routes by which this bacillus is excreted from the body are only three: feces, urine, and sputum. Therefore, the dangerous excreta serving as reservoirs of this bacillus are these three: feces, urine, and sputum.

Routes of typhoid transmission: The only gateway through which typhoid bacilli invade our bodies is the mouth, which is the entrance to the digestive system. The routes by which typhoid bacilli reach our mouths from their reservoirs—that is, the transmission routes—include both direct and indirect paths, namely direct transmission and indirect transmission.

Direct transmission refers to cases where infection occurs through direct contact with patients, bacillus carriers, and their excreta, who serve as bacterial reservoirs.

Indirect transmission refers to infection through some intermediate medium. The main cases are as follows:
(1) Food items: Various foods and beverages such as milk, tofu, sashimi, vegetables, etc.
(2) Water: Drinking water or utility water (wells, dug wells, rivers, etc.)

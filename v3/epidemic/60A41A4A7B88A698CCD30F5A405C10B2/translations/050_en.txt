Items unsuitable for steam disinfection should be exposed to sunlight for four hours or more.

(E) Floor boards should be sprinkled with carbolic acid water or cresol water and wiped extensively with straw brooms or similar implements.

(F) Under floors should have floor boards removed and lime milk sprinkled uniformly over the entire surface.
For structures that are tightly constructed and deemed to have no risk of pathogen contamination, removal of floor boards is not required.

(G) Floor mats, straw bedding, rice hull padding, and similar materials should be incinerated and replaced with new ones.

Article 8: For wells, earthen floors, sewers, ditches, refuse pits, and other unsanitary places, disinfection and cleaning methods should be implemented in the following order:

1. Wells and water tanks
(A) For well water and water tanks, quicklime in an amount of at least one-fiftieth of the water volume should be made into a milky solution and added, then after thorough stirring, this should be used to wash the well sides and well casing.

(B) After completing the above work and allowing twelve or more hours to pass, the well should be dredged several times, and when clear water is restored, it may be used without hindrance.

(C) Well bucket ropes and bamboo bucket poles should preferably be incinerated.
However, when unavoidable circumstances exist, bucket ropes should be boiled for thirty minutes or more, or soaked in carbolic acid water or cresol water for six hours or more, then washed with boiling water and dried.

Diphtheria

Cause: Discovered by "Klebs" in 1883 (29 years ago), diphtheria (a medium-sized rod-shaped bacterium with a club-like appearance (Figure 5), non-motile), and the pathological condition of this disease is a toxic symptom caused by toxins produced by this bacterium.

Resistance: Temperature... dies in 10 minutes at 58 degrees Celsius. Drying... there are cases of survival for 6 months when attached to toys. Chemicals... dies in half an hour in 1000-fold mercuric chloride solution or 20-fold carbolic acid solution.

Predisposing factors: Common cold, etc.

Age is greatly related. Infants rarely contract this disease, and infection is most frequent between ages 2 to 10,

then gradually decreases, with adults being affected relatively rarely.

Sources of diphtheria bacteria: (1) Diphtheria patients (2) Diphtheria bacterial carriers (3) Pseudomembranes and secretions

Diphtheria bacteria are localized in the pseudomembranes of diphtheria patients and on the mucosal surfaces where pseudomembranes are attached. Therefore, saliva and sputum are most dangerous. While these bacteria usually disappear from the mucosal areas several days after recovery from the disease, in so-called bacterial carriers, the persistence of bacteria can often be recognized even three weeks to three months later. Also, in adults, there are those who harbor highly virulent bacteria in their throat while being completely healthy and showing no symptoms whatsoever.

Diphtheria transmission routes: (1) Direct transmission - when pseudomembranes or secretions directly reach the mouth and nose of healthy persons during patient coughing, etc.

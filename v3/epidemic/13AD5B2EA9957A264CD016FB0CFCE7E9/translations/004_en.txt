Eventually they will die. This happens because when water becomes putrid, small insects naturally spawn in it, and these attach to the goldfish, causing them to die. Therefore, if humans also stay in bad air every day, they will eventually contract disease. This is because bad air naturally generates a type of bacteria, and when this enters through a person's mouth, it immediately affects the stomach and intestines, causing vomiting and diarrhea. This is cholera. Therefore, as mentioned before, places that constantly emit bad odors such as toilets, sewers, and garbage dumps should be sprinkled with deodorizers to purify the air - this is most important. Well then, everyone, do you understand?

〇Bathing or washing should be done frequently, but letting the wet body be blown by wind because it feels good is truly bad, so when you come out of the bath, immediately dry your body well and put on clothes. Also, dozing and afternoon naps are not good even in normal times, so during this season it is best not to do them at all.

〇Heavy drinking is bad to begin with, but especially during this season when infectious diseases are prevalent, those who drink five gō should reduce to three gō, and those who drink three gō should reduce to one gō. Also, refrain from sexual intercourse. [To the proprietors of restaurants and brothels, just a word]

Should you suddenly experience watery diarrhea or vomiting without any abdominal pain, immediately apply a paste made of mustard powder mixed with wheat flour dissolved in water, spread on paper and applied to the solar plexus, and soak the lower body from the waist down in hot water containing mustard to warm it well, then immediately call for a doctor. If you are careless and the vomiting and diarrhea occurs once, then twice, and finally egg-white-like substances begin to be discharged, it will be too late.

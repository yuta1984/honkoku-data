[Right]
Yo　For prevention, avoid heavy drinking, overeating, and unclean things
　　Especially deeply abstain from sexual activities

Ta　Since it concerns your own precious life
　　Don't think of it as someone else's problem and regret later

Re　During treatment, truly caring isolation hospitals
　　Cannot be matched by whatever you do at home

So　When fingertips become cold like ice
　　Death is usually unavoidable

Tsu　At isolation hospitals there are doctors on standby
　　Who exhaust all adaptive medical techniques

[Left]
Ne　Understanding that what comes from catching cold while sleeping is severe
　　Use cotton flannel as a belly warmer

Na　A careless mind is the beginning of it all
　　Know that cholera is a thief of the belly

Ra　When guests come and use the toilet
　　Sprinkle medicine afterward by all means

Mu　Even tiny insects invisible to magnifying glasses
　　Become big trouble once they enter through the nose

U　The inner skin ulcerates and breaks, and the organs'
　　Fragments and blood become diarrhea

Ho　The origin is indeed India they say
　　Cholera makes everyone become Buddha (die)

He　If there is diarrhea, never be careless
　　For it is the same as the beginning of cholera

To　Even traveling far across China, cholera disease
　　Never tires, its poison fierce

Chi　Scattered here and there, this year too has already begun
　　One should prepare measures to fight cholera

Ri　Even if you exert yourself, if you cannot defeat the disease
　　You'll lose with a thud, so practice health maintenance

[Left]
Nu　Like a nail in rice bran, uncivilized people's poor health habits
　　Are not just their own problem

Ru　Even similar diseases will still spread, cholera
　　Don't hide it thinking it's trivial

Wo　Inferior though it may be, food matters - pay attention
　　Don't eat things that are hard to digest

Wa　This epidemic spares neither young nor old
　　Once infected, it finally takes your life

Ka　Since catching cold becomes the beginning of it all
　　Don't strip naked or catch cold while sleeping

there is such a creature. It is the size of a dog, with skin beneath its legs. Its head is like that of a horse, and from the waist down it resembles a bat. Its fur is like that of an otter but larger. Its form plays the dual role of beast and fish, like Sadakurō in beggar theater - a laughingstock of our times. This must be Japan's sea lion (ashika). They live in large groups on Ashika Island in Kishū, countless numbers sleeping on the sand. Their cries echo "ō, ō," and their snoring sounds are particularly dreadful. Among them, there is one that appears to be like an old needle-woman, serving alone as a sentinel. When a fishing boat approaches, just like a brothel keeper waking up courtesans who have overslept, it rouses the many sea lions and makes them all tumble into the water.

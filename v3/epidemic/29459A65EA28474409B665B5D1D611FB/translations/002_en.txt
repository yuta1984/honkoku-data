Is "measles" a formal name or a popular name? Is it a haiku name or a name expressing virtue? Or is it a posthumous title, or perhaps just a nickname? In any case, the real name is a confusing disease name. The Yamato spirit of our great imperial nation does not concern itself with such trivial semantic distinctions. We simply read it easily as "hashika" and use it commonly. When we search the ancient records, we find it written as "iname-kasa" (rice-eye sores). It is also written as "akamo-gasa" (red blister sores).

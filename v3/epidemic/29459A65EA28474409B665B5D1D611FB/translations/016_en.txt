Since this creature frequently harmed people, long ago there was a virtuous sage called Musō Kokushi who chanted a mantra. The text goes "Ashika wa, tōkara, on hinare, on inoko, inoko, sowaka" - that is, "Om inoko inoko svāhā" (Om puppy-child puppy-child svāhā). Drawing close to their ears, he loudly proclaimed the verse "Deaf ears! Deaf ears!" and also taught them with two poems:

In this world there is no pleasure like sleep
　　　　　　　Yet fools who know not this rise up to work
Loving morning sleep and evening sleep, napping in the day
　　　　　　　Occasionally waking only to doze while sitting

Perhaps due to the miraculous power of these poems, afterwards they ceased to cause any harm at all. For more details...

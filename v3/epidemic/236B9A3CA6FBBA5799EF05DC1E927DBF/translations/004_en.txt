Having heard that Lord Miyake
performs the art of variolation
in Aki Province,
establishing excellent techniques
for the benefit of children who would suffer from this disease:

Though the wind blows and petals scatter from the treetops,
apart from the frivolous breeze,
how quietly the cherry blossoms remain　　Yoshiki

[Note: Around the third lunar month when flowers scatter, epidemics were thought to disperse and trouble people. This refers to one of the rituals performed by the Jingikan (Department of Divinities) in ancient times under the ritsuryō system to ward off epidemics, worshipping the two deities Ōmiwa and Sai.]

　　On Variolation Being Practiced Exclusively by Noble Persons

This variolation is an excellent method unparalleled in history, and nothing surpasses it in saving human lives. Since this vaccine was brought from Holland in the second year of Kaei (1849), the year of the Metal Rooster, many people have come to revere and trust it. It is well known that in Kyoto, beginning with the Imperial princes, and throughout the provinces, the great lords practice it exclusively. Such noble personages conduct thorough investigations and research, never employing anything that is even slightly reckless. However, when common people doubt this method based on their own solitary judgment, or criticize it, they are truly what we call stubborn and ignorant (people who understand nothing).

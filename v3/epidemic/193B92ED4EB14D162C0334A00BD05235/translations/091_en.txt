Illustrated Tale of the Syphilis War, Volume 4
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　By Funakoshi Keisuke from Yonago, Hōki Province【White seal】
　　　Enjumaru boasts of his courage but suffers defeat
　　　Baikōsan formulates a strategy to strike the enemy

Subsequently, in the human body country called Sukehachi, the two villainous generals—Jōkō Ketsudoku and his son Ketsudoku Nanji, along with Gekan Sōsei and his son Rōsoku Gekan—invaded and attacked Inkei Mountain and Biryō Mountain, advancing their positions toward the interior of the country. The mountain fortresses gradually fell, the common people fled, their vital energy and blood became disturbed, and their flesh withered away. They also established camps of putrefaction and pain at both eye gates, commanding small bandits to wreak havoc in the vicinity. They moved back and forth within the brain, raised war cries, blew conch shells, and rang bells. The sound reverberated through the head gate and ear gate, causing the earth's veins to shake and seem to split, bringing lamentation to the residents and suffering to the king.

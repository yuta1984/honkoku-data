This was the final battle of Scrofula Swell-High, who had earned the name of "one who cannot be matched by ten thousand warriors." Shouting "Let those who think themselves worthy take his head and achieve fame!" he charged straight in. Being brave soldiers who had already resolved to die, the vanguard of the medicine army was immediately cut down, and they rushed toward the main camp. Scrofula pressed forward relentlessly, fighting fiercely to cut into the main camp. Seeing this, Enjugan said, "What a poor retreat by our allies! Then I shall strike down this enemy and wake up these cowards!" He spurred his horse and approached, saying, "Ho there, Scrofula! Your fighting from earlier and this final battle are truly remarkable. Come now, let me guide you to the underworld!" While deceiving him with these words, he readied his spear and faced him. Scrofula never bothered with even a single word in reply, but raised his blood-stained great sword. The two fought without allowing anyone else to intervene, but Scrofula grew weary from hours of battle and could not match Enjugan's peerless valor.

Finally, he was thrust down from his horse. Since the general had already been defeated, how could the foot soldiers remain safe? They crumbled before one's very eyes, and all lost their lives in the chaos of the routed army. "Then with this momentum, charge into the camp, drive out the remaining soldiers, and take the Syphilis King's head!" Enjugan commanded all his troops, smashed through the camp gates, and rushed in. When they looked, the camp had become deserted with not a single remaining soldier to be seen. In the center of the main camp, one who appeared to be the Syphilis King sat formally in court dress, having committed suicide by piercing his chest with a treasured sword. Enjugan approached closely and raised his voice: "Ho there, Syphilis King! If your spirit still remains, listen carefully! I am the transformation of the Thunder God. Ever since I executed you in the Yin palace when you were Daji, we have been locked in conflict through countless lifetimes without end. Now too, we have become a pair of medicine and disease, and here I shall execute you!" He drew out that treasured sword toward the neck.

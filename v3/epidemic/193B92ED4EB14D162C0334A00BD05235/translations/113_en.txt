First, let me explain the origins of this situation. After the marshal departed for the tributary provinces, the country became increasingly pacified, with high and low alike taking pride in their peaceful state. It is human nature to forget danger when at ease, so the king gradually developed a careless attitude, distanced himself from the medicine soldiers without making clear use of them, and somewhat inclined toward pleasure-seeking. Taking advantage of this opening, the escaped Raireki Haretaka conspired with the Syphilis King and secretly sent generous bribes to the king's close retainers—Shokuyoku (who covets food) and Shikiyoku (who indulges in lust)—urging the king toward evil deeds and encouraging poisonous foods and lewd desires.

The rebels were ultimately destroyed because of the nation's strong vital force. Your use of generals and soldiers like Enjugan is not a plan for long-term security. Should rebels rise again in the future, please make me marshal. I guarantee to defeat any powerful bandits in a single battle. There is nothing at all to worry about." Through such slanderous eloquence he led the king astray, until the king finally followed his words and appointed the two retainers Shokuyoku and Shikiyoku to...

Baisō Gundan (Syphilis Military Tales) Volume 5, End

Baisō Gundan was written as an entertaining fiction to please the general public.
The newly published Baisō Sadan (Syphilis Tea Talks) specializes in treatment, so it details the profound secrets of syphilis therapy, selecting approximately fifty prescriptions including Enjū-gan, Baikō-san, Jisō-gan, Kiryō-tō, and other miraculous medicines, extraordinary prescriptions, and plasters. At the end, it describes in detail the various difficult chronic diseases and toxic conditions that I have treated. Therefore, by treating according to this book, any case of syphilis, no matter how stubborn or malignant the condition, should be cured rapidly. This is a book that those with aspirations in medical treatment should read.

...do not use [effective medicines], but instead give harmless mild medicines that are neither poison nor medicine, making patients take them for long periods. If there is fever, they lower the fever; if the abdomen hurts, they treat that pain; if there are sores, they give plasters, or use opium pills to relieve temporary suffering. They only trim the branches and leaves without treating the root, so there is never a time of complete recovery. For example, with chancres, they use topical medicines, wash solutions, plasters, etc., and that area heals temporarily, but then it transforms into paraphimosis, and when paraphimosis is treated it becomes bone pain, when bone pain is treated it becomes syphilitic eruptions, when syphilitic eruptions are treated it becomes scrofula. Thus it transforms in various ways, and later it coagulates in the head, face, hands, feet, chest, back, waist, abdomen, etc., causing swelling and pain there, or leading to putrefaction, loss of parts, and permanent disability. This is what is meant by "reaching the point of using an axe without cutting the two leaves." Speaking of its root cause, it comes from patients being weak-willed and selfish, and dishonest quack doctors not using appropriate prescriptions, but only treating superficial symptoms to comfort patients' hearts, making them take useless medicines for long periods to greedily collect medicine fees. Such quack doctors are particularly numerous in places like Osaka. There is also a type of blind doctor who does not know how to use mercury, quicksilver (sulfur, drosis, calomel, etc. are derived from mercury and quicksilver), fumigation medicines, etc., and having heard of only one or two of these methods, arbitrarily sets time limits, calls them "regulated medicines" and gives them, often misleading people, thus increasingly adding to worldly confusion. Now, mercury, quicksilver, etc. are harsh substances, so when used carelessly, the harm they cause is not insignificant. Long ago, Lord Changsang permitted forbidden prescriptions to Bian Que. These forbidden prescriptions were probably prescriptions for drastic medicines like mercury and quicksilver. Because they cause harm when used carelessly without knowing the methods of adjustment, they are forbidden and not lightly permitted to people, hence called "forbidden prescriptions," as one great physician explained. Therefore, mercury, quicksilver, etc. should not be used unless one knows the methods of proper adjustment.

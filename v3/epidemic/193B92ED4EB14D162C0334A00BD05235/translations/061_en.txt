He also sets up camps resembling crane-knee wind in both kneecaps and establishes camps of bone swelling and pain on both shins. In various places, some areas swell, some ache, some putrefy, some discharge pus and fluid, some cause alternating chills and fever, attacking and invading day and night without cease. Ruireki Haretaka spreads pneumatic swelling across the neck and throat...

When the head was struck off, something miraculous occurred - white vapor rose up from the cut, and from within it came a voice saying: "My evil thoughts would not cease, and I became a disease to destroy the Human Body Country. But having changed my form, my supernatural powers weakened, and I did not realize that you were protecting this Human Body Country. Thinking you were merely ordinary medicine, I fought alongside others, but ultimately suffered this defeat. My wisdom and courage could not overcome yours. Hereafter, I shall never again show my form in any country you go to. Now I return to my original dwelling place." No sooner had it spoken than the white vapor suddenly gathered in mid-air and vanished without a trace. The medicine army, seeing and hearing this, rejoiced triumphantly. They placed the heads of the Syphilis King and his retainers in containers, burned the corpses along with the camp buildings, raised victory cries, and withdrew. Juncho praised Enjugan's repeated achievements, and since the entire country was now completely healed, he recalled the medicine armies that had been sent to various regions and assembled the entire military force.

They returned toward the royal castle. The king, hearing this news and unable to contain his joy, went out far beyond the castle gates together with all his court officials to welcome them, serving as their guide to lead them into the palace. Juncho entered the castle, had an audience with the king, related the course of the war, and presented the heads of the Syphilis King and his retainers for inspection. The king praised Juncho and his men, saying, "To have so easily defeated such vicious rebels - this can truly be called the return of heavenly deities! First, let us celebrate your triumph and offer a toast!" He then held a great banquet, exhausting all the delicacies of mountain and sea for three days of hospitality, and brought out various rare goods and precious objects from the treasure house to present to Juncho and the various medicine generals, entreating them to remain in this country forever. Juncho declined this offer, saying, "We came only to punish evildoers. Now that the rebel forces of all countries have been completely destroyed, our desire to return home is swift as an arrow, and we cannot delay even briefly."

do not know, Chinese people also do not know, and Japanese people know even less. In my opinion, this disease is caused by infection with a type of malevolent qi that exists between heaven and earth, and those who have an innate toxic constitution become infected by this and develop the disease. Even human-to-human transmission is all due to this malevolent qi between heaven and earth. If this is so, then forcibly debating the disease's origin is a useless matter. Therefore, in the previous writing, attributing syphilis to the workings of an evil fox spirit merely shows how difficult it is to understand the cause - one need only think of it as a type of evil qi of heaven and earth and that suffices. Generally, when yin-evil qi condenses, it all becomes poison. In urban areas, many commit crimes and people are constantly being imprisoned. There is toxic qi in these prisons, and after being imprisoned for merely 3-5 days, when pardoned and returned home, after several days they develop prison poison and break out in sores like scabies. This is commonly called prison sores.

The fever is extremely intense. If one does not develop sores, the whole body aches, and the fever is like severe typhoid symptoms, with many dying. However, once one has suffered from this poison and recovered, even if imprisoned again, one will not be affected by the toxic qi. This is as stated in the previous writing - smallpox, measles, prison poison and such have virulent toxins, and when first contracted the illness is severe, with evil qi and righteous qi battling, the severe cases lose their lives, and those who recover have their evil poison exhausted along with their innate poison, leaving no poison in their body that can harmonize with it, therefore they cannot be infected again. With syphilis, at its initial outbreak the evil qi and righteous qi harmonize easily, therefore there is no fever, no loss of appetite, and no change in mood. However, this poison is not one that can be easily expelled. This is like the Buddhist metaphor of breaking stones and severing lotus roots. That which does not cause harm all at once also cannot be eliminated all at once.

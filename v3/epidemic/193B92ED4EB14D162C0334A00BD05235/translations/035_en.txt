We have summoned military strategists from numerous medical countries and engaged in battle many times, but the bandits are strong and our side has lost advantage. The country's danger is like a pile of eggs. This time, following the recommendation of the Birth-Accompanying God, we invited you, sir, and you have come immediately...

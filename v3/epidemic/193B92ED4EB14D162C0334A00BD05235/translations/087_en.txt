took it up and came to help, trying to attack from both sides. Enjugan's spirit grew ever stronger, and challenging the two opponents to battle, he gave a great shout, and in that moment speared Jishitsu-Jirō and launched him high into the sky. Then, dodging Jōkō-Ketsudoku's iron hammer, he firmly grasped its handle and with one twist, the hammer handle made of refined iron snapped with a crack—only a small portion remained in Ketsudoku's hand while the hammer passed to Enjugan's hand. Against such heroic strength there was no remedy; Ketsudoku and his remaining soldiers trembled and shrank back, having no fighting spirit left to face him again, and turned their horses to flee.
Enjugan immediately raised that iron hammer in one hand, aimed at Ketsudoku and hurled it. His aim was perfect—it struck right in the middle of the backbone with a sharp blow. Ketsudoku could not endure it for a moment, fell headfirst from his horse, and vomited blood profusely.
Seeing this, the medicine army became even more courageous, raised victory cries and gave chase, so the syphilis bandits

remnants had no footing left and barely managed to lift up Ketsudoku, sling him over a shoulder, and flee toward their main camp. Enjugan restrained his various armies, saying: "Do not press desperate enemies too hard. Today we have already defeated Jishitsu-Jirō and wounded Ketsudoku, so what can the remaining bandits accomplish? If we pursue them too forcefully, the enemy troops will become desperate and counterattack. At that time, our side will also suffer many casualties, and especially our newly restored national strength might collapse again due to fierce battle. Just let them flee and withdraw our army." Following this command, the various military forces did not pursue them far, sounded the retreat bell, raised victory cries three times, and returned to the main camp. At that point, Marshal Junchoku came racing up in his chariot, praised Enjugan's martial valor, Taifutō's nourishing support, and the loyal fighting of all soldiers, and ordered Taifutō to further supplement the country's deficiencies. Thus the citizens of the nation of Ki-Ketsu-Sui grew stronger day by day, and the bandit forces gradually disappeared.

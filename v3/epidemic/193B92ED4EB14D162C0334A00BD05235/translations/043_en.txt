rise up in various places and trouble the nation. At this time, one cannot distinguish between syphilis and drug toxicity, and most mobilize for battle calling it 'drug toxicity,' but generally without success, ultimately leading to national destruction. What is the meaning of this?"

From this, one should know that it is not the harm of drug toxicity, but the recurrence of syphilis bandits.

"In this vast world and great universe, surely there must be miraculous remedies for certain cure. Give up your impossible desires, quickly return to good nature, follow the principle of the Supreme Ultimate, and share your fortune with heaven and earth. If your evil thoughts do not cease and you continue to torment the people, I too will concentrate my sincere efforts even more, eventually discover miraculous remedies, eliminate your poisonous evil, and permanently eradicate the root of disease. Life and death, fortune and misfortune lie with heaven - they are beyond your power. Rather than moving your useless tongue, depart quickly!"

Before he could finish speaking, the woman's complexion suddenly changed, her eyes became bloodshot, her hair stood on end, and she glared intensely at Junchoku, saying: "Ah, what impertinent words! Will my single-minded determination, which has solidified since the beginning of the world, be overturned by your teachings? I spoke of advantages and disadvantages with good intentions, yet you do not heed this and still seek to oppose me. What an unexpectedly foolish person! Now I shall first kill you and clear away future obstacles. Prepare yourself!"

She lunged at him, seized Junchoku's topknot, lifted him into the air, and appeared to exhale poisonous vapor from her mouth. Suddenly the house shook violently, ominous foul odors overflowed the room, entering mouths and assaulting eyes and noses.

At that moment, a cluster of purple clouds drifted across the window, and as brilliant auspicious light flashed, a great general leaped out. His height was over nine shaku, with large eyes and a broad face, his color thoroughly red, with whiskers and curly hair parted left and right. On his head he wore a golden helmet, his body was clad in chain mail of turmeric leather, he wore underneath a hitatare of hundred-flower brocade, at his side hung a sword with pine and paulownia crests, on his lion belt were bow and arrows, and in his hand he brandished a long-handled mountain-opening axe. Without even a word of dialogue, he aimed at the monster's head and struck, saying "Be reduced to dust!" Perhaps it thought this was unbearable.

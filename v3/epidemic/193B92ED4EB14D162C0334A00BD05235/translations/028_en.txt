are tormented and gradually the body becomes emaciated, unable to eat or drink. From this point, if we employ the method of consumptive fever and attack the capital of the lung organ to produce coughing, it will become the fatal symptom of syphilitic consumption, and none will be far from perishing and being lost. To destroy so many human body kingdoms at once in this way—is this not a most delightful thing? Though it is not self-praise, all of this comes from the techniques of my wisdom.

As for light powder, inhalant medicines, quicksilver, turpith, jalap, scammony, aloe, and such—they cover their ears even at hearing the names and fear them like serpents and scorpions. Therefore, even if life is lost, they would never engage in battle using strong medicines to decide victory or defeat all at once.

Moreover, if we too fear strong medicines, it would be difficult to enter the human body kingdom and wage war. Even if we encounter strong medicines, we need only respond well to opportunities and follow changes—sometimes avoiding, sometimes confronting, [dealing with] their vigor

The nasal bridge was swollen and painful, hearing was lost, and severe headaches occurred. Although Enjū-gan was used, it was ineffective, so this was discontinued and Baikō-san was given, achieving rapid cure. Since the patient was robust in constitution, Bainiku-gan was also given, causing vigorous purging. ○The battle of Kinkichi-koku represents a case where both bendoku (inguinal bubo) and yōbai-sō (syphilitic facial lesions) developed. Keibō-haidoku-san was used concurrently for its surface-releasing effect, but Enjū-gan proved ineffective. Baikō-san was also tried but was likewise ineffective.

It simply depends on whether it suits the individual patient or not - those who respond should use it, while those who don't respond should change medicines. Since this book is originally a work of fiction, it merely presents the general outline to demonstrate usage. The detailed variations and subtleties cannot be exhausted by pen and paper - those who take the medicines should understand for themselves. Fearing that people might think all the contents of this book are false if they use these medicines without discerning whether the disease and medicine are suitable or not, and judge based solely on presence or absence of effects, I spend several more pages to explain the reasons

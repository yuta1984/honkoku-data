and exhaust them while prolonging the time is essential. Originally, light powder (mercury) and quicksilver have fierce and violent natures, so wherever they pass, the agitation and disorder are extreme, and they would instead become a harm to the entire country. At that time, if we attack and strike in one burst, there should be no possibility of not winning.

Furthermore, when that opportunity arrives, I will perform the art of creating duplicates of myself, borrow the souls of quack doctors to deceive and confuse the master, slander the various generals of strong medicines to distance them and prevent their use, and moreover employ various ingenious schemes, working through thousands of transformations.

Now, in the entire universe, I know of no one who could be my enemy. Only the likes of Taigongwang Raishin—in terms of both wisdom and courage, they surpass me and are fearsome beings. Now they have received life in the heavenly realm and serve as divine generals protecting the heavenly court.

Previously, I came to hate a doctor named Tokujitsu Junchoku who was devising theories for treating syphilis. I manifested my form intending to kill him, but was startled by that Raishin. Far from killing the doctor, I could barely hide my form and only just managed to escape and return. Ultimately, when revealing one's form, one often suffers unexpected defeats. While remaining as formless energy, even those fellows are not to be feared. You too should understand this well.

Even as I speak thus, I am concerned—prolonged stay is useless. Come now, you should all withdraw to your respective countries. I too shall hide my form." As he rose from his seat, joy appeared on the faces of all his retainers: "Our great king's ingenious strategy is thus! No matter what strong medicines may advance, crushing them in one battle and destroying the human body kingdom is within our grasp. Ah, how pleasant and joyful! Well then, let us each depart to our original places." As they spoke, the condensed evil energy rose up, suddenly scattered in all directions, the forms that had been there vanished, and only the sound of wind withering the grass and trees of the wasteland remained.

Junchoku, filled with wonder, turned to Raishin and asked: "The human body kingdom that the Syphilis King just spoke of—what kind of place is it? I beg you to clarify and enlighten me."

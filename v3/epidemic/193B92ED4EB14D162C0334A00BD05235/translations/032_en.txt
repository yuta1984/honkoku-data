"...would be most welcome." These words were truly courteous. Since everything Raishin said was appropriate, Junchoku harbored no doubt and bowed in response to the divine being, saying, "I have received your instructions. Though I lack the talent of a military strategist, I am fortunate to have the assistance of Ryoshō, Raishin and others. Together with them I shall go to your honorable country and, though inadequate, shall strive faithfully in battle."

Raishin took up the response: "Be at ease. From now I shall immediately call down the various generals and we shall enter the country together." Finishing these words, he stood up and beckoned toward heaven. Like shooting stars streaking across the sky, suddenly numerous heavenly deities came flying down from above the clouds. First came Yin Jiao, then Xin Shen, then Bo Yi Kao, and slightly behind them Taigongwang. Some armed themselves with armor, others wore the garments of civil officials, standing in formation as space permitted.

Raishin looked left and right and said, "To approach the human body kingdom in this form will not suffice. We must change our appearance to enter. Please begin first, Master."

Junchoku was utterly amazed, wondering "Have I perhaps become a hermit sage, or have I become a celestial being?" and forgot himself, leaping up and dancing about.

Meanwhile, Raishin and the others—Yin Jiao, Xin Shen, and Bo Yi Kao—all transformed into minute and mysterious forms, with medicinal qi swirling densely around them. Taigongwang raised his feather fan and said, "Listen, Junchoku! I am involved in governmental affairs and cannot easily leave the heavenly court even briefly. However, I shall protect you with divine powers and lend you eloquence and wisdom, ensuring you make no mistakes in all matters according to the circumstances. The four divine generals shall also assist Junchoku to achieve merit..."

Like a flying bird, she dodged and broke through the window, flying up into mid-air. From within the swirling clouds came a voice: "Hey Junchoku, listen carefully! I intended to kill you now, but since my sworn enemy has come, I am hindered and cannot act. I shall let you escape for now, but before long you will learn your lesson!" The voice gradually grew distant and vanished without a trace.

At that time, Junchoku bowed his head before the great general and said: "I was tormented by the demon and was about to meet an untimely death, but through the general's help I have miraculously been saved. I have no words to express my gratitude for this life-giving grace. I do not yet know who the general is. Pray tell, what manner of personage are you? I humbly request that you reveal your great name."

The great general nodded and said: "Your doubt is reasonable. I am none other than Raishin, retainer of King Wu of Zhou, who in ancient times at the Battle of Rokudai cut down the great army of Yin and gained a name for unparalleled courage. In those days, that demon took the form of Dakki in the Yin palace, so knowing my prowess, she still fears me as you have seen. I have now been reborn in the heavenly realm as a divine general protecting the imperial palace. Through my supernatural powers I knew of your peril tonight and deliberately came to save you from certain death. This is all due to karmic connections, which I shall explain in detail later. Now I wish first to guide you to where that evil spirit and her followers reside, let you witness their state, and discuss future matters. Follow me and come quickly, hurry, hurry!" he urged.

Junchoku bowed twice and said: "With such repeated kindness, how could I disobey your command? Then I shall follow behind you." He stood up and, though trembling, grasped the sleeve of the armor. With one hand drawing him close and the other raised beckoning, purple clouds descended again and enveloped their two bodies. A pure wind arose swiftly beneath their feet, lifting and dispersing the clouds as they raced far across the void.

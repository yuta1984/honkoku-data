This is the outlet of the river waters in the country, a place where vital energy particularly gathers, and because it is the most important route in the male country, the suffering is extraordinary. Every time the bandit army attacks this place, the sound reverberates through all the pathways. Kotsu Itami Ugokazu secretly invaded between the bone joints and encamped in strategic locations, wielding violent power, so the pathways of the bone structure and joints are tormented by this, and the pain that cuts off the functioning of movement throughout the country is most severe. Meanwhile, Juncho's party had already arrived in the country, so Kusho-shin came out to greet them and led them into the royal castle.

Juncho inspected the various armies, selected generals, divided the troops, and sent them forward in proper order.

They determined where they would encounter the bandit army as the battlefield and advanced in good order. Hearing this, Kotsu Itami Ugokazu coordinated with Gekan Hayanari, saying "This time's medicine generals have wisdom and courage that cannot be underestimated. A reckless battle would be dangerous." Kotsu Itami Ugokazu led several thousand cavalry out of the main camp to block the road, while Gekan Hayanari continued to guard Intozan Mountain as before, commanding his subordinate bandit general Ketsunetsu Kintsū to severely attack the Inkyo Road. Since this Inkyo Road is the most important location in the country, when it is attacked, suffering reverberates throughout the country, and the lord cannot bear the anguish and will surely cease military action and seek peace negotiations with ointments and such.

Having been thus instructed, Jisōgan acknowledged each point one by one and departed leading his troops. In this battle, the bandit demon Makofu performed his arts, causing hot winds to blow across the entire country, and while the people suffered from being invaded by the heat, Juncho stopped the heat with his method of dispelling the demon wind Makofu. Although their suffering ceased, the area around the eyes had been struck by that hot wind, causing the vital energy and blood to scatter in disorder, producing swelling and pain, and the eyes were about to close completely.
Hearing this, Juncho urgently commanded Sengan-tō to rescue them. Sengan-tō rushed to the eyes and used medicinal water to treat the disorder of vital energy and blood, dispersed the swelling and pain, and in a short time achieved success, completely curing the affliction of the eyes. Meanwhile,
having defeated in a single battle the famous Enjugan, Baikōsan and others whose reputations were well-known, the syphilis army concluded that there could no longer be anyone capable of resistance on the medicine army's side. "Then let us launch a counterattack from our side and crush the medicine army," they were discussing, when a minor bandit came running up.

"I have been on reconnaissance, and from the medicine army's side, a force of troops has come outside the palisade flying a banner inscribed 'Syphilis Bandit Subjugation Envoy Jisōgan' and has taken up position. So I secretly infiltrated to observe their situation, and while the defenses of the four gates are tight, the interior of the camp appears very careless, with officers and soldiers gathering together holding banquets. In the center, what appears to be the general Jisōgan is intoxicated and leaning against a desk, turning to his various soldiers and saying: 'In this battle the syphilis army is extremely strong, and even the famous Enjugan and Baikōsan were defeated in a single engagement. After that, I received orders for a second punitive expedition, and though I have no choice but to advance, against such a formidable enemy who could even defeat Enjugan and Baikōsan, how could my meager strength possibly prevail? In any case, tomorrow's battle will surely mean death in combat. Therefore tonight we hold our final banquet, so you too should drink excessively to your heart's content and exhaust this life's farewell.'"

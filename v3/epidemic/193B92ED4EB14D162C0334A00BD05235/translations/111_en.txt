As their bodies burned with sudden, unbearable itching and pain, the officers and soldiers of the medicine army could not even face forward, holding their heads in confusion and distress. Seeing this, the mold army seized the opportunity and counterattacked all at once, cutting them down mercilessly.

Both generals immediately set out, with Bokuyaku circling to the surface while they raised a battle cry from the rear of Kaisen's position like a great mountain collapsing.

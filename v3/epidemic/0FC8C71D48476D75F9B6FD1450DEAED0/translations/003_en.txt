volume. That book thoroughly details everything from ancient and modern therapeutic methods to methods of prevention and disease avoidance, leaving nothing uncovered. The master diagnoses pulses and administers medicines day and night, having no time for other matters, yet he has undertaken such literary work.

If all who read this book keep it in their hearts and thereby avoid the tragedy of untimely death, then our earnest wishes will have been fulfilled. To say that there is no efficacious way other than Western therapeutic methods is narrow-minded. This serves as the preface.

One should quickly take Kakkon-to or Goreisan and similar formulas to induce sweating. Sweating

If the effectiveness penetrates thoroughly, the diarrhea will gradually stop. However, if one becomes careless thinking it is a mild symptom, it will suddenly manifest signs of vomiting, cold extremities, and loss of pulse. There is also another type where there is simply rumbling in the abdomen with profuse diarrhea like an overturned basin. Although the general condition does not change particularly, with each bout of diarrhea the flesh wastes away, the eyes sink in, and the nose becomes pointed. Eventually this rumbling seems to pierce through from within the chest causing diarrhea, and suddenly vomiting erupts. This is an extremely acute condition where one must not let one's guard down for even a moment. The treatment method is to frequently take formulas like Oren-to (Coptis Decoction) and Shokyo-shashin-to (Fresh Ginger Decoction for Draining the Heart), keeping warm and covered so that natural sweating occurs. (A certain person learned the treatment methods for these diseases from a Frenchman in Yokohama, which was indeed Shokyo-shashin-to with added cinnamon twig, peony, and evodia. One can see that Chinese medicine is primarily used even in places like Hong Kong.) If vomiting suddenly develops with agitation, one should first take five bu of equal parts clove and dried alum as fine powder with water. (This formula is for treating vomiting in children

and is now being used effectively.) Afterward, use Shosho-in (Summer Heat-Clearing Drink) (five ingredients: pinellia, poria, gypsum, licorice, fresh ginger). For those who cannot keep down the medicinal juice, it should be taken cold in small amounts. If both vomiting and diarrhea stop but thirst and agitation develop, one should use Chikuyo-sekko-to (Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction), Byakko-to (White Tiger Decoction), and similar formulas. If vomiting and diarrhea stop but after two or three days the thirst does not cease, the tongue coating becomes increasingly thick, or turns black with agitation, this indicates heat toxin retained internally. One should quickly purge with Dai-saiko-to (Major Bupleurum Decoction) (for cases where the disease is primarily in the chest) or Choi-joki-to (Stomach-Regulating and Qi-Bearing Decoction) (for cases where the disease is primarily in the abdomen). If treated carelessly, the facial color will turn red, or red spots will appear all over the body, or the person will become delirious like a drunk person, and eventually die. Also, even when using Shosho-in, there are cases where vomiting and diarrhea are difficult to stop for one or two days. Sometimes they stop when using a water decoction of two ingredients - citrus peel and agastache - soaked in cold water, and sometimes they stop with Koyoku-in (Tiger Wing Drink) (pinellia, poria, citrus peel, fresh ginger).

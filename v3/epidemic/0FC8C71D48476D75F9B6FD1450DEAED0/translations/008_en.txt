　　Considerations on Korori (Cholera)

Upon examination, there are theories that "korori" derives from "korou-byou" (tiger-wolf disease), which is another name for "kōran" (disorder) in the Manbyō Kaishun medical text, or that it is a corruption of the Western word "cholera." However, these are all forced interpretations and not worthy of belief. The original meaning of "korori" is a colloquial term in our country meaning "sudden collapse," and it has been used as the name for this disease since ancient times. According to the "Genroku-kan Kiroku" (Records of the Genroku Period), around Genroku 12 (1699), a disease called "korori" spread in Edo and was prevalent that month. If one quickly decocts and drinks nanten berries and pickled plums, one will not contract the disease. Otherwise, one will gradually fall ill and die of korori, so throughout Edo people decocted and drank nanten berries and pickled plums. The person who reported this was a greengrocer named Sōzaemon from Kanda Suda-chō, who had prepared many pickled plums from Osaka the previous year. This year, pickled plums from the Kamigata region were sold out and not available at all, so he was able to sell his pickled plums at high prices.

The subsequent annual epidemics in Chikuzen and Chikugo provinces are detailed in contemporary medical discussions and in "Shōni Bōri Shinkō" (New Considerations on Childhood Violent Diarrhea) by Takatori Sonken from Chikuzen. The most severe outbreak thereafter occurred in the autumn of Bunsei Jinba year (1822). According to "Oneki-ron Hakki" (Exposition on Epidemic Theory), the Jinba epidemic initially spread from Korea to our western provinces, passed through the San'in region to reach Osaka, and infected entire households regardless of age or physical strength, with momentum like splitting bamboo, causing 300-400 deaths daily. "Kōsei Shogen" records that between Jinba and Kimihibitsuji years, there was an epidemic in the western provinces where people had watery diarrhea two or three times, with sunken eyes and pointed noses. This was that disease. "Jikan Dokuga Sho" records that from late autumn to early winter of Bunsei Jinba year, a disease called "three-day cholera" epidemic spread in Osaka. It initially arose in Kyushu, reached the Chūgoku region, spread to Osaka, and occasionally had patients in Kyoto. The symptoms began with sudden chills followed by severe vomiting and diarrhea, sometimes pressing on the chest—acute cases died within a day, while milder cases died after about three days, hence the name. In Osaka, it was extremely widespread, with entire households dying.

It is said to be similar to what "Dōsui Sagen" calls "three-day monk." It was probably a type of cholera. Dōdō Kan'in said it was a condition for Zōson Richū pills. Indeed, that seems reasonable. At this time it epidemic in the Ise region but did not reach Edo. Later, in the autumn of Ansei 5 Tsuchinoe-uma year (1858), it began in Nagasaki, spread through San'in and Nankai regions throughout the country, with Edo being particularly severe. By early winter it had spread to Ōshū, finally stopping when snow fell. Elder Kitamura Kōsō said that in the autumn of Ansei 5 Tsuchinoe-uma year, a disease called cholera epidemic in the capital. This was like what medical texts commonly describe as bansa. On August 8th, Itō Sōeki had diarrhea at 4 AM, became delirious, and died at 7 AM. The next day, a maidservant of the same house also died. The neighbor Tanaka Hikoshichi (age 68) also died on the 7th. Deaths occurred consecutively in the neighborhood, with the downtown area being most affected. Initially it spread from Nagasaki gradually to western provinces, with Osaka being most severely affected, then to the east.

Essential Knowledge of Violent Diarrhea　Appendix: Nomenclature

Previously, having received official permission, together with more than ten like-minded individuals, we established a hospital on Morita Street in Asakusa, naming it Nyoshun. We invited Master Asada of Kurion to serve as director. The number of patients treated annually was no less than several thousand, and among these, those who died numbered only slightly more than ten. This was truly a great blessing for the common people and indeed fulfilled our expectations. In recent times, there has been a type of epidemic disease called "tiger-wolf dysentery" (cholera), which has been spreading year after year, and the number of deaths caused by it is incalculable. Its onset is as sudden as a downpour, without any prior warning, and death comes as quickly as lightning, not allowing even a moment's time. Therefore, physicians are thrown into panic and confusion, not knowing how to respond. How much more so for ordinary families dealing with the disease. The master deeply lamented this situation and thus wrote books such as "Chien-hen" and "Essential Knowledge of Violent Diarrhea," which have already been published. Last year, he also wrote "A Study of Tiger-wolf Dysentery."

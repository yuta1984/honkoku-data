Memorandum of Oral Statement
We trust that you are in excellent health, which is indeed a most auspicious matter. Now, I had intended to depart on the coming 9th day for sankin-kōtai (alternate attendance), but recently my chronic hemorrhoid condition has flared up again. Despite earnest medical treatment, there has been no improvement whatsoever, and I am in no condition to force myself to travel by palanquin over such a long distance. Therefore, though it causes inconvenience, I must postpone my departure. As soon as there is even the slightest improvement, I intend to set out. Please convey this matter appropriately to the Council of Elders

The matter that was announced should be
communicated from the petition office.
Regarding the illness, naturally one should
remain in seclusion, but should there be
any instances of going out to nearby places
under the pretext of recuperation or similar reasons,
this would not be appropriate. At present,

secret agents are circulating throughout
all provinces, so naturally
any behavior that would be inappropriate
for one's medical condition must not occur.
Therefore,
please keep this in mind, and I am writing
to you personally to inform you of this matter

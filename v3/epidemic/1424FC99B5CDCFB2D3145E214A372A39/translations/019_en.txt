1. Regarding Tadauemon, a retainer of Fujishima Seizaemon 
   who resides in Ashidagari: This man has long been 
   impoverished, living with elderly relatives including his grandmother, mother, 
   uncle, and household members. His wife

   while he himself has sold half his labor contract. 
   Upon returning from this arrangement, he has cared for the aforementioned three elderly persons.

   He has accepted this responsibility, and moreover, his reputation as a 
   filial person has long been known. Therefore, as a reward,

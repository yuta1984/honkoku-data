Therefore, as this concerns our family profession,
I earnestly wish for him to
pursue his studies on his own initiative.
However, since the travel expenses
to Edo alone would be considerable, I wish
for him to study in Kyoto instead,
and therefore request that he be granted

another three-year leave of absence.
Although my personal financial circumstances are quite
strained,
since this cannot be omitted due to our family profession,
I will arrange the various travel expenses
and other costs as much as possible
from my own resources, so please
grant the leave of absence as petitioned.

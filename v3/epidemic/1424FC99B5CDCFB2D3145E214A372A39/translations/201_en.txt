From among the squad foot soldiers, Kohara Yasube'e was
　　promoted to御徒士 (o-kachi, samurai foot soldier). As a result,
　　the aforementioned Mura-emon, having previously received
　　an increase of four koku in stipend rice, Yasube'e's former
　　position was assigned to Hyōbu-zaemon's squad.
　　　　Mizumachi Han'yo, new foot soldier
　　　　　　　Makise Sadaemon　
　　　was ordered to be incorporated into the squad as

　　　replacement for the aforementioned Mura-emon. This is because
　　　he had previously been granted a stipend of two koku
　　　of rice as a new foot soldier.

and has been living day by day until now.
Upon hearing of this situation, this time
the authorities have provided five hyō of rice
and ordered that the aforementioned daughter
become my adopted daughter, which I consider a most grateful arrangement.
I shall make proper arrangements to raise her without neglect
and ensure her healthy growth in all respects.

Should there be any instances of neglect,
I shall accept whatever punishment
may be ordered. For this purpose, I submit this signed pledge.
The above.

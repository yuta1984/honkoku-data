injured him, so afterwards several
workers surrounded him and grabbed him in various places, making it
completely impossible for him to use both hands, and the Taku workers
unreasonably took him back to their lodgings, whereupon
the district office immediately sent over Oki Seigo,
who consulted with the head village official, and the aforementioned Kanzaemon was
brought back. Regarding the treatment of the injured person,

Sagara was sent over from the viewing stand
with his seal, but as his condition
was not improving, the head physician Haraguchi
Munmasu was immediately ordered
to provide medical treatment.

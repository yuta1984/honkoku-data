The duty to the Crown Prince's education cannot be declined, so I write at the end: "Food and flavors nourish life, but when eating becomes harmful, it can instead cause damage. Especially with smallpox, what it affects is particularly important, and there are often those who fall into danger because of this. How can this be taken lightly? The publication of this book is truly a supreme treasure for smallpox practitioners, and it should be widely transmitted and not kept secret."

One: The sickroom should have folding screens and sliding doors set up around it so that wind cannot enter. Also, bright sunlight shining through paper screens is not good. A dimly lit environment is preferred.

One: Smallpox dislikes sweating. If sweat appears, the pustules cannot be maintained properly, and excessive precautions with thick clothing and head coverings may instead cause harm.

One: Undergarments must not be changed. If one catches wind-cold during smallpox, sudden changes occur, and severe cases die immediately. However, during hot weather and warm seasons, this is an exception.

One: Carrying a severe smallpox patient on one's back, holding and walking with them, or rocking and moving them all increase fatigue. This is especially harmful during the suppuration and scabbing stages.

One: The primary taboo with smallpox is scratching and rubbing the pustules to damage them. During the swelling and suppuration stages, one must be vigilant day and night. If the face is damaged, mild cases result in residual toxin, while moderate to severe smallpox cases inevitably result in death. This is entirely the fault of the caregiver. It is a great error for people to think it merely leaves scars. A moment's carelessness or dozing off can kill a precious child.

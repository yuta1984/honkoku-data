truly has the marvel of opening one's eyes. And as for his learning, from the principles of human life to the properties of medicines and stones, he relies on reality to clarify their applications, verifies them through diseases, and applies them in treatment. Even the most mysterious and subtle matters become as clear as pointing to one's palm. Moreover, the master's expertise derives from direct instruction in Dutch medicine, and his investigations have already reached perfection. It cannot be discussed on the same level as what is transmitted by contemporary trends. Unable to contain my admiration, I have forgotten my own inadequacies and dare to express my true feelings. That my verbose and redundant words invite laughter from all quarters is something I naturally do not decline to accept.

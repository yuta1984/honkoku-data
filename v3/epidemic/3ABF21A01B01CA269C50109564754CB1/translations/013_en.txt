During my travels to study medicine in various regions, I observed that among what are currently called epidemic fevers, seven or eight out of ten cases have their pathological origin in fatigue, with symptoms affecting consciousness. When physicians rashly administer diaphoretic and cooling remedies to such cases, they inevitably err in treatment. Those engaged in medical practice merely speak of warm epidemics and cold damage with their mouths, but cannot firmly maintain their therapeutic principles. Therefore, when encountering such symptoms and applying treatment, they generally use either Bupleurum or Aconitum, or employ mild and inactive medicines. Light cases may fortunately escape death, but severe cases can only fold their hands and await death. This is solely because there is no clear theoretical framework.

Originally, after Zhongjing authored the "Treatise on Cold Damage," people throughout the realm learned to treat cold damage disorders. After Wu Ke authored the "Treatise on Warm Epidemics," people throughout the realm learned to treat warm epidemics. Later practitioners cannot go beyond these two schools, but regarding this particular syndrome, they still cannot escape doubt and confusion.

From the Tang and Song dynasties onward, figures like Dongyuan successively appeared and established categories such as overwork, common cold, internal injury, and external contraction. Although Dutch medical books discuss nervous fever, they show only a glimpse and do not present the complete and comprehensive picture.

Our country has long enjoyed peace and prosperity, the people have grown accustomed to idleness, wisdom and intelligence compete against each other, skills and crafts vie with one another, and people are ignorant of the arts of guarding the interior and defending against external factors. Therefore, those afflicted with this disease are gradually increasing, but physicians do not know methods of treatment, leading to successive mutual infections with countless deaths. Alas, how can enlightened persons bear to sit by and watch this?

Although I am not gifted, I exhaust my mental and physical efforts to present the refined theories transmitted by Western physicians along with what I have personally verified, making this public for the world. I hope this may provide salvation. Cold damage is injury by wind and cold, warm epidemics are caused by sensing the malignant qi of heaven and earth - the Chinese have long had established theories for these. However, this epidemic is different. The person has originally damaged their spirit through excessive thinking and injured their muscles through overwork.

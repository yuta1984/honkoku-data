Those afflicted suffered from headaches, delirium, or diarrhea and bloody stools, with various symptoms appearing from unexpected quarters. The physicians were amazed and bewildered, looking at each other in confusion. Their skills were exhausted and their techniques spent, and in the end they could not even determine what name this disease should bear. Batei listened carefully to the detailed description of the condition, examined it thoroughly, clapped his hands and said, "This is what we call nervous fever in our country." Upon detailed investigation, it matched this disease perfectly. He then brought out two volumes and presented them to Mr. Ryōtei, saying, "These were written by Hufeland and Consbruch. They are highly esteemed in our country in recent times. If you study and savor these thoroughly, there will be nothing lacking in the methods for treating this disease." Ryōtei obtained these works and did not put them down for several months, translating and combining the two books, pruning the verbose and selecting the essential, refining the essence, adding his own experience alongside, and compiling them as a Theory of Epidemics. I have read this three times over, and not only are the principles of the original works profound and subtle, but the translation reads as if one were receiving direct instruction. At times there are passages that awaken and alert the reader. Ah, what a blessing from Batei!

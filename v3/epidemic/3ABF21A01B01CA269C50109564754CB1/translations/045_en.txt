One should secure victory at once. Therefore, the essence of therapeutic methods is not to focus on tonifying deficiency and rescuing collapse, but rather to concentrate on supporting vital energy and expelling pathogenic factors. Once vital energy is aroused, the mechanism of separation and expulsion naturally activates, pathogenic factors cannot persist, and will eventually collapse and flee. This is what Western philosophers have transmitted, and what I deeply respect - a universal principle unchanging through all ages. Even if there are those who come after, they cannot raise objections to this.

Chapter 40: There is a Distinction Between Aromatic Penetrating Volatile Medicines and Astringent Tonifying Medicines

Aromatic penetrating volatile medicines have an acrid taste and light quality, moving without stopping, dispersing without gathering. Among the meridians, muscles, bones, and finest details, there is nowhere they do not reach. They facilitate qi circulation and blood flow, thereby assisting the mechanism of vital transformation, causing pathogenic toxins to have no place to accumulate. Therefore, they can support vital energy and expel pathogenic factors. Astringent tonifying medicines, however, are different - they are heavy in quality and astringent in taste, using substance to fill deficiency. Therefore, they can treat diseases of non-toxic leakage and collapse, but they have an easily distinguishable black-and-white difference from medicines that break up accumulations and expel pathogenic factors.

Aromatic penetrating volatile medicines are light in nature and ascend and disperse in the qi realm. Even when sealed and stored, this can be proven by how their fragrance strikes the nose. Therefore, when taken, they can penetrate even into the finest spaces between pulse networks, muscles, bones, and minute fibers. When encountering pathogenic factors, they disperse them; when touching the nervous system, they stimulate and activate it, causing what has been compressed and blocked by pathogenic factors and is about to cease functioning to be activated. At this point, the nervous system can move, the mechanism of expulsion naturally arises, and the achievement of expelling pathogenic factors is thereby accomplished. However, astringent tonifying medicines are of solid form...

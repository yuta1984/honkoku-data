Those with weak blood qi, or those naturally frail in constitution and sensitive to touch (translator's note: like people who are susceptible to lacquer poisoning) are most susceptible to infection, and their symptoms are often dangerous. This differs when compared to elderly people. When the disease develops from within, the person is weak with incomplete digestive function, the nerves are tense, vapors are congested, obstruction has already reached its limit and cannot flow smoothly, vigorous fire stirs up the blood, and pathogenic heat is formed. This is the difference between internal and external causes.

Pathogenic toxins are originally brewed within the human body, and because their nature involves volatilization and weathering (derived from Hufeland), they can swim about in the air. Therefore, infection occurs through breathing and the skin. Once infected, it necessarily collides with the nerves. This process can be understood but cannot be seen. This is because even when dissecting corpses of those who died from this fever, changes in the nerves have not yet been confirmed (anatomical theory can be seen in Consbruch). The reason young people are easily infected is that their nervous perception is quick and agile, and their blood is abundant, so if there is even slight contact, the nerves are stimulated, blood rushes, fire qi gathers accordingly, and heat develops. Elderly people have dull perception, so this is reversed. In other words, what Consbruch calls all incidents that trouble the various nerves and make perception sensitive are entirely the causes of this epidemic - this can be said to sum it up in one statement.

Someone asks, "What is the reason for the difference in sharpness and dullness of perception between young and old?" The answer is: "Because in elderly people the solid body is tough and resilient, while in young people it is soft and flexible."

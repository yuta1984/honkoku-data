The essential points of treatment methods lie only in raising the spirit-qi to restore paralysis and preventing pathogenic heat from becoming deeply entrenched. Therefore, aromatic penetrating and volatilizing medicines are primarily used, and beyond this there are no other medicines to be given. This is because patients become ill due to pathogenic heat becoming deeply entrenched when spirit-qi fails to rise. Generally speaking, the nervous system is where consciousness originates and miraculous transformations emerge; the governing principle of the entire body must arise from here. Therefore, if pathogenic influences invade, the righteous qi cannot help but struggle against them. Thus it seeks to rally and expel them, but if the pathogenic influences are strong, the righteous qi cannot prevail. If the righteous qi cannot prevail, the mechanism of separation and expulsion will inevitably cease to function, righteous qi will increasingly weaken, pathogenic qi will increasingly flourish, and there will be no rest until death. This is why volatilizing medicines are used.

This heat is caused by pathogenic toxins adhering to the nervous system, causing it to become paralyzed and dysfunctional. Therefore, the treatment method is to stimulate and activate the nervous system, encouraging its function to expel and eliminate the pathogenic influences. This is indeed the main principle of this entire book ○ Someone asks: "Why is it difficult to quickly eliminate this pathogenic toxin using sweating, vomiting, and purging methods as with other heat toxins?" The answer is: "In this condition, the pathogenic influences first adhere to the nervous system and rob it of its function, so if one rashly uses aggressive methods, there is harm from attacking weakness and cutting down the righteous qi, naturally weakening the power of expulsion, and inevitably causing the pathogenic toxin to become deeply entrenched. The difference in treatment methods from ordinary epidemic fevers depends only on whether the pathogenic influences adhere to the nervous system or not" ○ According to Seki's observation, among various febrile diseases there are those with fixed time periods, and this is also true for this fever.

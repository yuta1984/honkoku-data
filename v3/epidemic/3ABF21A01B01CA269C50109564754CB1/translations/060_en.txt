Chapter 7: The Efficacy of Medicinal Baths

The method of medicinal baths moistens dryness, promotes circulation, and stimulates the mechanism for dispersing and separating pathogenic toxins. Its effects far surpass those of steaming, hot compresses, and topical friction medicines.

The main therapeutic effects include harmonizing the meridians, equalizing blood circulation, and treating palpitations and insomnia, muscle spasms and flesh twitching, mental confusion, rapid irregular pulse, pathogenic toxins concentrated in the head and chest, or pathogenic fire that has stagnated with already weakened spirit-qi. It is also effective for all cases of organ paralysis or when patients have become accustomed to medicines and internal medications are completely ineffective. The formula is:

Chamomile flowers　　Lavender flowers　　Thyme
Marjoram (2 ounces each)　　Calamus root (4 ounces)
Melissa (2 ounces)　　Spring water (as appropriate)

Boil the above for 20-30 minutes, add 3 bottles of grape wine and half a bottle of spirits, then use.

There are proper methods for medicinal baths that must not be treated carelessly. The temperature should be appropriate, guard against wind and cold externally, and be cautious of tinnitus and dizziness internally. Moreover, it is essential not to cause the patient to faint or collapse. During this time, the physician should provide careful supervision.

For patients with severe symptoms and depleted vital energy, bathing should not exceed 8 bu (about 30 minutes). If one is careless, it can kill a person in an instant.

After bathing, immediately take aromatic penetrating medicinal liquid and rub it all over the head and chest. While still warm, dress in cotton clothing and set up a warm bed in a heated room for peaceful rest. Massage the entire body through the clothing for about half an hour, keep warm and covered to induce light sweating. Those who sweat show particularly good results. This should be done once daily.

This is a sign that the entire body transforms like gangrene.

Chapter 6: Difficulty in Recovering Strength After Recovery

Those with severe pathogenic heat may be unable to rise for a month after recovery, or may have difficulty recovering their strength even after three months. The rampant pathogenic qi poisons people to this extent.

After recovery, some have amnesia and body heat that does not subside for more than half a year. When their body heat was like burning at the time, those who sought immediate relief by dousing with water to forcibly cool the heat often suffer from this problem later. This must be understood.

Those whose strength is consistently difficult to recover suffer because pathogenic qi weakens the nerves. People who cooled their heat with water and retain amnesia suffer because the heat was forcibly suppressed by cold water, preventing the pathogenic toxin from undergoing proper maturation and elimination. Someone asks, "What is maturation and elimination?" The answer: "It refers to the natural good function of original circulation, which generates heat and boils blood fluid to produce coagulated substances (corst) [Note: derived from Gordon] like pus, which encapsulates pathogenic toxin and expels it externally through sweating, urination, expectoration, and so forth." When Seki was in Nagasaki, he was fortunately able to save the daughter of one Uchihashi who had contracted a severe illness, but her amnesia did not heal for over a year. Though no water dousing treatment was administered, it was likely that the pathogenic toxin failed to achieve proper maturation.

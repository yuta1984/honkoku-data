This is what he said. Try this nearby example: apply mercury ointment externally to induce salivation, or grip croton seeds to cause violent diarrhea - through these you can understand that external medicines have medicinal effects.

Someone asks: "What is the principle behind medicines that are initially effective becoming ineffective as the stomach grows accustomed to them?" The answer is: "The principle of nerve sensation becoming accustomed can be understood through a nearby analogy. When you apply a vesicant plaster for a long time as a test, initially that area responds to the cantharidin, causing pain and itching, and in severe cases the sensation spreads throughout the body causing chills and fever. However, if you continue applying it for a long time, even though it discharges fluid and produces pus, this naturally stops and eventually forms a thick white skin. Even though the plaster is potent, it no longer causes pain or itching, becoming rigid as if applied to dead matter. Even after healing, when you touch that area, it has become numb and lost sensation. This is because nerves possess good intelligence - when strongly stimulated by substances, they naturally retreat and hide in the interior, forming thick skin as a shield. The principle is the same when flesh that is strongly touched by objects develops calluses. Even internally, if stimulating medicines are used repeatedly, the nerves likely become like this and lose their effectiveness."

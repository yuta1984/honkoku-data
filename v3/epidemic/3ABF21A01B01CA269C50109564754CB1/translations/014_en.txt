Those who read this book should carefully and repeatedly examine it against actual cases and fully experience hardships. Then they will know without need for argument that these theories are not strange fantasies but can be trusted like divination with yarrow and tortoise shell.

During travel exposure to wind and dampness, or losing one's usual residence due to disasters, this

This disease also transmits between people, similar to what Li Dongyuan called "fatigue-induced cold." Since the original text already had the name "epidemic," calling it "nervous epidemic" now takes from that old designation.

○The prescriptions recorded in this section mostly come from the original texts, but some of the medicinal ingredients are difficult to obtain in our country, and the substitute medicines used by our predecessors are also not yet appropriate. Therefore, we preserve the original names to await future scholars. However, regarding the self-tested prescriptions that are appended, the intention is to make them convenient for use. Some prescriptions come from the oral traditions of Western physicians, and all bear the two characters "self-tested" to distinguish them. Readers should carefully discern this.

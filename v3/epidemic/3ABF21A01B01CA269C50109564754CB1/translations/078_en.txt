Postscript　
The treatment of febrile diseases was founded by Qihuang, perfected by Zhang, refined by Tao and Li, and completed by Wu Youke. Western physicians such as Pogan and Morning have also discussed it in detail. However, recently there is a condition for which an accurate treatment has not yet been found. Its symptoms appear to be excessive (shi) but purging should not be used, and appear to be deficient (xu) but tonification is not appropriate. Only when using aconite can one sometimes achieve a cure.

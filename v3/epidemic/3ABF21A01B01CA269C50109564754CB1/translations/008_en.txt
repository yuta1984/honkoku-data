The explanations were forced and far-fetched, as vague as trying to catch shadows, with nothing to be gained. At this time, Dutch medical theories were quite well-established in our country, with translated books numbering more than just one or two. Therefore, I joined their circle and borrowed a volume to observe, salivating three feet long, dabbling in exotic flavors. Though picking up the scraps from others' wisdom, I could barely comprehend the general outline of internal anatomy and dissection. Observing the therapeutic techniques practiced by their disciples, they were no different from what ordinary doctors did—having already failed in Chu, they could not succeed in Qi either. The more I studied, the more clumsy I became.

It was then that I first realized that someone as untalented as myself was of no benefit to medical practice. Filled with shame and regret, I finally cast aside my medical tools, returned to my hometown, humbled myself to study the national classics, and took up the side pursuits of tea ceremony and flower arrangement, intending to end my life in tranquility. This was for no other reason than thinking it better to cause no harm to people rather than to benefit them.

Now there is no part of the body's blood that has not become corrupted, and all the lesions have turned into gangrenous ulcers. I fear rescue will be difficult." Before he finished speaking, malignant symptoms erupted, and the child finally passed away. The condition and symptoms all matched what had been predicted, his theory was admirable, and the matter served as convincing proof.

In my grief and anguish, I deeply admired his exceptional insight and thought: with such a skilled physician as the master, what disease could not be diagnosed, what condition could not be cured? At this point my old passion was rekindled, I set my resolve as before, left home to receive his teachings morning and evening. My only regret is that having passed forty years of age, my memory has greatly diminished, and with children causing disturbances, though I have not yet fully realized my aspirations, upon hearing the general principles, there is truly an enlightening

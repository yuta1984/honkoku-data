For those with vomiting:
　Add half a cup of grape wine or half a cup of Valeriana decoction to the previous formula.

Use according to the previous instructions.

Alternative formula:
　Add 4-5 rin each of musk and dragon brain to the stopping formula.

Use according to the previous instructions. For those in deep sleep who are difficult to awaken, remove the opium. Generally, for people in extreme deficiency, do not use more than two cups.

Lubricating Enema Formula (self-verified formula)
　Agar decoction (96 sen)　Honey (8 sen)　Musk (4 rin)

Mix these together and irrigate into the anus. Generally 64 sen; stop when retained stool is obtained. For those with severe inflammatory heat, add half a cup of strong vinegar.

The above three formulas each have different main functions. The key point in adopting them is to use substances with stimulating properties to prepare the agents. Indeed, their origins have meaning that cannot be overlooked.

The flour in the stopping formula serves as a buffer to prevent the opium's strong taste from harshly affecting the intestines. This formula is swift in stopping diarrhea and does not cause drowsiness as internal administration does. When I have tested it, it is gentle yet effective.

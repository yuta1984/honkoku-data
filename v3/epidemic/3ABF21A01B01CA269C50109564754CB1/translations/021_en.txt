This fever's reception naturally has degrees of severity based on internal and external, gradual and acute factors. The same applies to treatment. ○ Someone asks, "Why are there differences between acute and chronic onset?" The answer: "It is still due to the sharpness or dullness of nervous sensitivity and the thinness or thickness of blood. Just as firewood receives fire at different speeds depending on the amount of oil and resin in the wood."

Chapter 9: Dividing Severity into Three Grades

Dividing the severity of disease into three grades: Mild symptoms are those where the spirit is not disturbed. Severe symptoms are those with mental derangement. Fatal symptoms are those showing signs of blood corruption.

Those whose spirit is not disturbed have pathogenic heat that does not deeply invade the nerves. Those who become disturbed have severe invasion of the nerves. Blood corruption occurs when both flow and coagulation lose their delicate harmony and separate.

Chapter 10: Mild Symptoms

In mild symptoms, mental faculties are not disturbed and no ominous signs appear. Sometimes recovery is possible even without medicine. However, if the disease does not pass twenty days, the body heat will not subside, and the condition of urine will also be difficult to restore quickly.

Even though the disease is mild, it is difficult to cure quickly because the pathogen adheres purely to the nerves. Indeed, the nerves are the sovereign of the entire body and govern the vital functions of all bodily mechanisms. For example, it is like when a good minister falls ill and the entire country falls into disorder.

That is to say, these are the stages of initial development, maturation, and resolution. Generally, in this epidemic disease, the first seven days are designated as the developmental stage when the disease increases and grows; the middle seven days are designated as the maturation stage when the pathogenic toxin undergoes transformation and ripening; and the final seven days are designated as the resolution stage when the pathogenic toxin is expelled from the body. However, if the natural vital function of primordial movement is not robust and cannot achieve maturation, or even if it does mature, if the primordial movement cannot withstand that labor and cannot achieve resolution, then ultimately the outcome can only lead to one of two paths: success or failure. This is similar to how smallpox is analyzed by establishing the stages of initial fever, spot appearance, full eruption, pustulation, and scab formation. This establishes a standard for medical observation and is set up for use in treating diseases and examining illness. The main principle of all treatment lies in supporting the mechanism of transformation and circulation to achieve and accomplish the natural function of resolution. When I reflect deeply on this, it exists not only in febrile diseases but in all conditions. Indeed, just as all things in heaven and earth have beginning and end, start and finish, and follow the principle that what flourishes must decline and what is born must die. Enlightened gentlemen would understand this early on without waiting for our Dutch explanations, but what I record here is merely additional words written for like-minded colleagues after reading Heckel's recent book with deep sighs of admiration.

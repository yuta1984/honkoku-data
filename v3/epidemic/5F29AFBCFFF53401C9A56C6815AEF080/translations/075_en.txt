Since this is a location within Saga's official registry, we submitted a written pledge to the Seiki village headman stating that we would not conduct any construction work in the future. As there was nothing further to report to Ninomaru, the notice boards listed below were removed during the night. An inspection by the magistrate is scheduled to be completed tomorrow morning.

One notice board - In front of Teraura guard post
                  Within directly administered territory
One notice board - Within Matsuura village eastern temple lands  
One notice board - Within Honjo mountain village temple lands
One notice board - Within Seiki village directly administered territory
One notice board - Within West Seiki village directly administered territory
One notice board - Within Kuro Forest area directly administered territory

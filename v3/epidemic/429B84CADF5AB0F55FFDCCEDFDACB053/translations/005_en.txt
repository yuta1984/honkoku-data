1. What I have written down includes things I have learned through tradition and personal observation that should be useful. I have compiled various matters hoping that they might be of some help to households dealing with illness. This is where my true intention lies.

1. This book does not include medicinal prescriptions and theories. These are the physician's domain, and what physicians do involves examining the writings of hundreds of schools from ancient and modern times, applying them to illnesses, and prescribing medicines. This is originally something that requires great mental effort and discipline. Since this book is not intended for specialized scholars, it does not include prescriptions and theoretical discussions, and the writing is extremely colloquial, containing many things that might be laughable.

1. Alas, the variations of illness are truly limitless, and the methods of treatment are correspondingly endless in their adaptations.

This is naturally the case. Even regarding the knowledge that patient households should have, it certainly cannot be exhaustively covered in scholarly writings, but I am simply outlining the general principles and conveying the main points. I hope readers will kindly understand this.

1. From what I have observed over time, many people die from smallpox not because it is severe, but because of mistakes in nursing care. Generally, eight or nine out of ten cases are not malignant or fatal symptoms, but rather mild and favorable symptoms. The initial treatment methods are inappropriate, nursing care is mishandled, and later when options become limited, death eventually results. The root cause lies in truly minor errors, and if the methods of care were correct, these would not be cases destined for death.

Ekiki-to (Qi-boosting decoction) should be used with modifications.

Scab formation (haitomari - three days) - This refers to when smallpox lesions dry and form scabs.
The condition resembles the bottom of a shell, with the center raised high, and when scabs form this way, it is a good symptom. At this time, beforehand, one performs "sasayu" (bathing with hot water). If residual toxins have not been exhausted, they will fester again due to the hot water. This is commonly called "ura-uchi" (reverse strike) because it is too early. At such times, Shofu-san or Shodoku-in should be selected and used. Bathing should be delayed. If vital energy has not recovered, one may catch a cold and worsen. It should be done only after everything is properly arranged. The commonly used medicine is modified Hochu-ekiki-to, used with careful consideration. Daiho-to and Hachimotsu-to should be used as deemed appropriate.

If scab formation occurs with "kyohan" (deficiency irritability) causing fever and difficulty eating, Kami-hogen-to should be used.

Restoration (shiage - three days) - This is when the scabs finally fall off.
At this time, the vital energy becomes extremely fatigued. Hachimotsu-to and Daiho-to should be selected and used. Even after scabs fall off, if residual toxins remain, abdominal pain is common. Goboshi-in should be used. If there is retained food, Kobushi and Shukusha should be used for elimination. For throat pain, Bakumondo-to or Sandzukon alone should be decocted and taken. For cough and phlegm with wheezing, Seikin-san and similar formulas should be used. Until scab formation, it takes thirty-five days. Scab formation and restoration together take twenty-one days in total.

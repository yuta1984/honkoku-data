Among the common people, there are also those who roughly know about this. On Hachijo Island, there is something called miyakosuge-gusa (ashitaba grass) that is said to be beneficial when eaten morning and evening. Does this plant perhaps prevent the formation of fetal toxins? It is said that there has never been smallpox there. If so, there are indeed methods to escape through proper care and dietary restrictions. Therefore, I record at the end below what people in the world have used and found effective, to inform others.

○Asking: In the "Shōchi Junjō" (Standards for Diagnosis and Treatment), it says "when a child is born, if you burn the umbilical cord and have the infant take it, they will avoid smallpox or it will be mild." A certain person used this method, and among three children, one died and two were completely cured. If so, the Hachijo grass also seems similarly unreliable.

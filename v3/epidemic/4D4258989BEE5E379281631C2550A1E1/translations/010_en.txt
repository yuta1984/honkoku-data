○Question: Beginners do not know the time periods of smallpox. What should be done?

Answer: Generally, the time limits are set with three days as one fixed stage, with 3, 5, and 15 days as the great method. Some establish ten stages, which are recorded on the left.

Great Method: Fever onset, Smallpox announcement, Rising swelling, Pus penetration, Scab formation

Ten Stages: Initial fever (hothori), Initial emergence (homise), Complete emergence (desoroai), Rising surge (mizumori), Pus flow (akaumi), Full pus (yamaage), Water return (fudeui), Scab formation (kareshio)

Fever onset (hothori - three days) - also called preliminary illness

This symptom resembles wind-cold food injury and others, so using medicines like Shoma-kakkon-to with modifications or Haidoku-san to induce sweating will resolve the fever and bring out the smallpox.

However, there are diagnostic methods. The middle finger of the hand, ear rim, tip of nose, tip of buttocks, and toes become cold, or there may be severe headache, back pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, and irritating fever. Children experience convulsions, fright reactions, and upward-gazing spasms. Adults mainly have irritating fever, headache, and aching fatigue in the lower back and legs with irritating pain. The following prescription was frequently used by my late father with good results, so I include it here.

Sochen Decoction: Perilla leaves, Tangerine peel, Luffa (each in equal parts)

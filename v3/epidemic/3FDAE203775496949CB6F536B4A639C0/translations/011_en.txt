Dosage method: For both adults and children, when fever is strong in the initial stage, large doses should be administered. Avoid foods that are raw, cold, sticky, slippery, pungent, sour, alcoholic, or foul-smelling (seirei nenkatsu goshin su shu shūsei).

1. When measles erupts like scattered millet porridge, protruding and pointed, with a red and moist color, this is favorable measles. When the color is purple-red with scorched lips, or when the color is dark red, dry and withered without moisture, with cracked and parched lips, yellow-black tongue coating, constipated bowel and urinary movements, phlegm and wheezing, mental confusion, dizziness and vexation—these symptoms indicate a malignant condition. Blood should be drawn from the Weizhong and Chize acupoints. For children with severe fever from various diseases, especially for erysipelas, if you apply suction to the area around Dazhui and Shenzhu acupoints, blood will gather at that location, and applying moxa will cause bleeding. Following this procedure to reduce fever and cure the condition is wonderfully effective.

The measles described above is a malignant condition. Sanhuang Jiashigao Huanglian Baihu Tang (Three Yellows with Gypsum and Coptis White Tiger Decoction) should be used frequently, and safflower should also be prepared and used.

For cases with strong fever, various symptoms, teeth grinding, and frequent thirst, Baihu Tang with the addition of Scutellaria, Coptis, and Scrophularia should be used. For measles, cooling remedies are suitable, and warming medicines should be avoided. However, this depends on the specific symptoms. During cold weather, when exposed to wind-cold causing blockage of surface qi with strong chills preventing measles eruption, Gegen Tang should be used.

When used continuously, stagnant heat and fetal toxins are purged downward, leading to longevity. When smallpox or measles appears in such children, use Purple Pills more than usual and purge greatly at the initial onset. If one is negligent, malignant symptoms will inevitably appear and the child cannot be saved. In measles and smallpox, there are cases of staring fixedly at the initial onset. Children with constipation suffer, but they recover when purged. Children with strong fever and diarrhea frequently relapse and become like chronic infantile convulsions, which are difficult to treat. Do not avoid diarrhea at the beginning; it is appropriate to use medicines for clearing heat and purifying the bowels. Tonifying, astringent, and center-regulating formulas should be used with careful consideration.

When epistaxis occurs in measles, it is good. This is because intense heat is resolved from the blood aspect. It is appropriate to use formulas for expelling and detoxifying poison. According to the examples in the Treatise on Cold Damage, formulas with cinnamon and ephedra need not necessarily be used.

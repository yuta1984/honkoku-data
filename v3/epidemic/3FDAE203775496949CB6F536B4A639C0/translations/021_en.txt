Although delirious patients appear to have vigor, they are actually mentally unstable, and their bodily qi is greatly weakened by deficiency fatigue, so aggressive treatments should be given only after assessing the deficiency or excess of their bodily qi.

If delirious patients are not treated, they will eventually die.

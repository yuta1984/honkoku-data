Although it is said that [blood-nourishing and fetus-stabilizing] medicines should be used in combination, blood-nourishing and fetus-stabilizing medicines will interfere with promoting measles eruption and reducing fever. If the fetus is lost, one should treat with care in the postpartum treatment method so that measles heat does not enter the blood chamber. In general, blood-supplementing medicines have been used in both Japanese and Chinese medicine for postpartum cases. This is because seeing large amounts of lochia discharged postpartum, people fear it with the folk saying "monkeys cry when they see blood" and use blood-supplementing agents. Postpartum bleeding is the discharge of menstrual blood that had not flowed for ten months, not the discharge of particularly good blood. One should understand that if postpartum lochia is scanty, it causes harm. Always knowing that women have excess blood, yet giving blood-supplementing agents postpartum leads to conforming to their natural irritability and bringing out additional symptoms. Particularly, fever reduction after smallpox and measles in postpartum cases is essential. For both men and women from ages fourteen-fifteen to twenty-four or twenty-five who have slight fever after measles with heat in the palms and soles of hands and feet, some develop bone-steaming consumptive fever. One must attend to this without negligence. Shōsaiko-tō (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) with added Anemarrhena and Lycium bark should be used. Chikuyō-sekikō-tō (Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction) should be used, and moxibustion treatment should be applied to the back. Common people who fear gypsum as a cold medicine are confusing it with calomel.

Children born into wealthy families constantly wear excessively heavy and warm clothing and bedding, causing their skin and flesh to become overheated and their skin to become fragile and soft. Therefore, measles and smallpox easily emerge on the surface, but due to the steamed and inflamed skin and flesh, measles and smallpox become severe.

Children of the poor, even in harsh cold winds, wear thin and coarse clothing with little warmth as they grow up, so their skin and flesh become firm and robust. However, this also has drawbacks - measles and smallpox have difficulty emerging, and while their food is coarse and plain, they are sometimes given rich foods (high-quality meat dishes) inappropriate for children. Pregnant women have no dietary restraints or prohibitions, and wet nurses also do not restrict their diet, so children's fetal toxins become strong and both measles and smallpox become severe. Nevertheless, regardless of social class, sometimes the elder brother has severe symptoms while the younger brother has mild ones, or the elder sister has mild symptoms while the younger sister has severe ones. Since the severity depends on how deeply the congenital toxic qi is received in the blood, medical treatment is crucial for both the noble and the humble. As the ancient saying goes, "A filial child must know medicine." Since children are raised to inherit their fathers' and ancestors' work, adding medical care for descendants' illnesses is also part of filial piety, so it should not be neglected.

For children who have fetal toxins due to inherited toxins from their parents, the poison of measles and smallpox runs deep, so treatment should be administered with great care. Use rhinoceros horn abundantly.

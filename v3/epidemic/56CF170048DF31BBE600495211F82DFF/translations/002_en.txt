Preface to Evening Rain Tales

The name "smallpox" is not of ancient origin. The "Introduction to Medicine" states that it existed from the end of the Zhou dynasty to the beginning of the Qin dynasty, but this is uncertain. The "Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies" records that during the Jianwu era (25-56 CE) of the Eastern Han dynasty, when attacking barbarian tribes in Nanyang, Chinese forces became infected with this poison, which then spread throughout China, hence it was called "barbarian pox." The "Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library" states that it was transmitted from the Western Regions to China in the fourth year of Yonghui (653 CE) during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang.

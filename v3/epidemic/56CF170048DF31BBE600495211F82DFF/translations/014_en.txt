...should not let [the child know]. Alternatively, there is also a method of boiling amomum seed (shanin) with a little salt added.

Toad Method (Gamahō)
In the eighth month, catch a large toad, remove the head, skin, entrails, and legs, wash cleanly, mix with sesame oil and a little salt, fry in a pot, remove the bones and have the child eat it. If [the child] eats about fourteen or fifteen [toads], they will not suffer from smallpox.

Smallpox Prevention Method (Kitōhō)
Cow bezoar (1 monme), toad venom (3 bu), cinnabar (7 bu), loofah stem (cut about 5 sun from near the stem, charred black, 5 monme)
Grind these four ingredients finely into powder, and for a one-year-old child, mix 1 bu with sugar and administer - this will surely prevent smallpox.

Another Method
Cinnabar (1 monme of the finest quality, ground very fine), musk (5 rin), sesame seeds (36 grains with shells removed, wrapped in paper and pressed to remove oil)

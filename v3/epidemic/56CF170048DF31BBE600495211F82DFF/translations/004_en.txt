It is transmitted to the people of the divine land (Japan), becoming a source of worry for all people for ten thousand generations - what a deplorable thing this is! From the Korean scholar Nam Chu-gang's work "Theory of Demons and Spirits," which stated that smallpox is caused by demons and spirits, Shinto scholars argue that this disease, which did not originally exist in the divine land, was brought from the Silla kingdom during Emperor Shomu's reign and spread throughout Japan. Since Sumiyoshi Ōkami is the deity who subjugated the three Korean kingdoms, people pray specifically to Sumiyoshi Ōkami for this disease, so calling it the "smallpox deity" seems reasonable, but Kaibara also noted that this is likely a false explanation.

However, there should be methods of prevention. My aunt married into the Chita district, and since that household practiced both medicine and farming, they cultivated mung beans. Having heard someone say that "mung beans neutralize smallpox poison," she never failed to grow mung beans year after year. Perhaps because of this, although she lived to over eighty years old, she never contracted smallpox in her entire life. My aunt constantly told me about this matter and continued to send me mung beans every year while she was alive.

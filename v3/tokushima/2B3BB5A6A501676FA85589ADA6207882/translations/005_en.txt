In Takai District of Shinano Province, from around the hour of the boar on the 24th, the day before yesterday, the earthquake was strong. Additionally, there are several damaged locations in the residences and row houses of retainers, collapsed peasant houses in the villages, and muddy sand gushed out from hundreds of ground fissures in fields and rice paddies, all pressing into the estate lands. Even now, earthquakes occur occasionally. In my domain, there are no injuries to people or horses. However, among those who went out for pilgrimages to Zenkoji Temple or seasonal work, there appear to have been some deaths, but the investigation is not yet complete. I will report the details later. First, I submit this report. The above.

In Shinano Province under Iga-no-kami's jurisdiction, from around the hour of the boar on the 24th of last month, due to an earthquake in Sarashina District,

houses in Inariyama villages collapsed from the tremors, fires broke out from these collapsed houses and spread violently, causing destruction. Relay stations for people and horses became inoperable. Additionally, in parts of Chiisagata District, there were collapsed houses, damaged locations, and deaths of people and horses. Even by the 26th, occasional tremors continue, as reported by local officials. I will report the details later, but since the aforementioned Inariyama villages concern lodging temples, and Iga-no-kami is currently in Osaka, I first submit this report. The above.

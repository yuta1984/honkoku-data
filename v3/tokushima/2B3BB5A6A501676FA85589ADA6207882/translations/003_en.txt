[Number unclear] Having heard these circumstances, from Kawanakajima area in the same province to Zenkōji Temple, and from there to the area called [number unclear] Sanchu, there appear to have been repeated earthquakes. In the Kawanakajima area, entire villages of private houses, or more than half of them, were shaken down, and some villages were completely destroyed by fires that broke out afterward. In one village, thirty to forty people, in others two to three hundred people suffered immediate death and injuries. The townhouses of Zenkōji were also mostly all shaken down and subsequently burned, with many immediate deaths and injuries. All along the highway routes, due to the Zenkōji memorial service at this time, numerous travelers were staying overnight, and therefore there were many deaths as well. The mountain areas are distant and remote, so the situation is difficult to ascertain, but there was a landslide upstream on the Sai River, which blocked the river flow, leaving no flowing water at all, and the ferry landing at Tanbashima dried up, requiring people to cross on foot.

Regarding the situation in Echigo Province, I do not know how it stands, as the circumstances are unclear. The above is only based on rumors and cannot be confirmed with certainty. Therefore, I am immediately dispatching my agent to inspect and investigate the collapsed houses and other damage in my administrative territory, and will also inquire about damage in neighboring villages through reports. I will provide detailed information progressively. However, regarding the villages in Saku District of the same province under my administrative custody, although they experienced the same great earthquake, perhaps because they are at a considerable distance from Zenkōji, the impact seems to have gradually diminished. In the jinya, administrative areas, and other neighboring villages under my private domain, there appears to be only minor house damage in each location. [Two characters unclear] There is nothing particular to point out, and there are no injuries or deaths. I hereby submit this urgent report [number unclear]. The above.

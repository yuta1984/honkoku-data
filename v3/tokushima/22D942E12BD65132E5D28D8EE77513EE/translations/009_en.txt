Even knowing this, those who harbor doubts and fail to rush to join us, or who arrive late, will see the rice and gold of the wealthy turn to ashes in the fire. Do not speak ill of us as lawless men who would waste the treasures of the realm. For this reason, all must be informed together. Most importantly, all the ledgers and records of the local lords and village administrators up to now must be torn up and burned. This is a matter requiring deep consideration for the future. Our intention is not to cause suffering to the people.

However, even if this undertaking may be likened to the rebellions of Taira no Masakado and Akechi Mitsuhide of our court, or Liu Yu of Han and Quan Zhong of Song, there is righteous reason for it. We have absolutely no desire to covet the realm or steal gold out of greed. The sun, moon, stars, and gods bear witness - where snow accumulates, it is only the sincere hearts of Tang Yao and Yu, Han Gaozu, and Ming Taizu, who mourned for the people, executed tyrant rulers, and carried out Heaven's punishment. If you find this doubtful, open your discerning eyes and observe where our deeds ultimately lead.

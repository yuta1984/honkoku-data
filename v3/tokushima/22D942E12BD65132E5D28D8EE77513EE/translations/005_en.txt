They arrest those who come down to buy five or ten to (measures of rice), which is truly the same as when the ancient lord Ge Bo killed children carrying meals to farm workers - utterly inexcusable. In any territory, the benevolent people are without doubt subjects under the rule of the Tokugawa house, yet making such distinctions is entirely due to the inhumanity of the magistrates and others. Moreover, they frequently issue selfish official notices, and those who consider only the idle people of Osaka city as important are, as I have said before, utterly shameless and inexcusable, failing to reform their moral righteousness despite their humble position. Furthermore, among the three great cities, the wealthy of Osaka lend money to various daimyo, amassing enormous profits in gold and silver as well as stipend payments, living in unprecedented wealth. Though merely townspeople by status, they are employed as retainers or stewards to daimyo, or possess vast amounts of rice fields and newly developed land, living without any want.

Even if we cannot restore the age of the sage emperors Yao and Shun or the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, we shall recover and restore the spirit of restoration. We wish to inform each village of this written notice, but since there are so many, we have posted it at the shrine of the nearest large village with many households. We shall take care that the patrol guards from Osaka do not become aware, and quickly spread word to all villages.

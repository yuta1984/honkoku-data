and gave them sake to celebrate the departure. Kinchō was greatly delighted, made full preparations, informed his household members of his temporary absence, departed from his Yamato residence, and prostrated himself respectfully at the gate. From that point on, Senkichi returned to his original nature, which was indeed mysterious. Now, Kinchō returned to the forest that was his dwelling, gathered many of his followers for a farewell cup, entrusted the affairs during his absence to both the tanuki of Takasu-no-in'gen and Hi-no-tama, and taking with him one hawk from Tōjuji temple and one foot soldier tanuki as his attendant, the three of them—master and servants—departed from Hibiraki-no-mura around the hour of the Ox at midnight and hurried toward the Tsuda-ura Cave Kannon.

The commentary states: This tanuki called Tsuda Rokuemon was the eldest son of Shiba'emon, had attained the high rank of First Rank, and had lived for three hundred years. However, recently he had made the Cave Kannon popular and was granting official ranks to various tanuki from different regions.

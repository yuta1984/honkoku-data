Faster than he could speak, Kawashima Kyūzaemon lifted up an enormous stone high above his head and threw it down with a grunt. At the same time, Sakuemon also struck the bed where Taka was lying with a large tree, but there was no sound at all. "This is suspicious," they all said as they gathered around and pulled back the bedding, only to find not Kinchō but bundles of straw inside the covers. Everyone was utterly amazed and stood there in blank bewilderment, when Rokuemon sneered and said, "Kinchō must have overheard our evening council and fled in panic. What a shame we were one step too late." Before he had even finished speaking these words, a loud voice came from the cedar tree nearby: "Hey there, Rokuemon! Are your eyes blind? Kinchō is right here! You scoundrels and your cunning ways—to think you would try to deceive this Kinchō is absurd! Now I'll show you what I'm capable of!" He hurled the large stones and logs he had stockpiled down upon their heads, causing Tsuda's group to panic greatly. "We've fallen right into Kinchō's trap! Quickly, get to safer ground!" they cried as they trampled over each other in their haste to escape.

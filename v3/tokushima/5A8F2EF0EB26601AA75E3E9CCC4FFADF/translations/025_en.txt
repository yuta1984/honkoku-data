So Kanoko understood and tucked the letter into her bosom, took leave of Kinchō, and returned home, looking back repeatedly with reluctance. Little did they know this would be their final parting in this world, as would later become clear. Now Kinchō buried the hawk's corpse in a place unknown to others, placed a marker stone, prepared himself, and came out near the ferry crossing. However, the long rains continued unabated and there was an extraordinary flood, so there was no way to cross. Moreover, night was breaking into dawn, and he fretted anxiously about what to do.

"Have I exhausted my martial fortune to this extent?" he lamented, throwing himself down on the beach and grieving beyond reason. But gradually collecting himself, he thought, "This is shameful lamentation for one such as myself. I must first return to Hibiraki Field, report to Lord Yamato, and avenge my hawk." He stopped his lamenting and looked around to see a takase boat bound for Tokushima passing by. Taking this as fortunate, he leaped onto the boat, crossed over to the other side without difficulty, and from there hastened his journey toward Hibiraki Field.

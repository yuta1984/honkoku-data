"We should explain the advantages and disadvantages to Kinchō and make him our ally. Depending on his response, we can plan accordingly." At that moment, Kawashima Kuzaemon leaped forward from the side and said: "That deliberation is not good. The reason is that since Kinchō would not listen even when the general directly explained the advantages and disadvantages to him, much less would he heed what we say. As the proverb goes, 'A cornered rat will turn and bite the cat.' If we say there's no way to deceive him by various means, then tonight we should secretly go to Kinchō's sleeping quarters

and set upon him, killing him with just one strike to remove all our troubles." Speaking without reserve, the general clapped his hands and said: "This scheme truly suits my heart. Rather than engaging in detailed discussion, each of you should make your preparations." The council decided unanimously, made their arrangements, and waited for the night to deepen.

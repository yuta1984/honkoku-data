How dare you deceive this Rokuzaemon! Though you may think I don't know, I already know all about it. If you confess quickly, I will spare your life. If you object, I will devour you on the spot!" he raged. Though Kanoko was startled, she maintained her composure and smiled gently, saying "This is an unexpected accusation I must address. Though I may be unworthy, my dwelling in your lordship's domain and supporting my household are all thanks to your great benevolence.

Why would I commit treason? Moreover, this talk of secretly communicating with the enemy is completely groundless falsehood. However, do you have reliable evidence?" Before she could finish speaking, Kuzaemon stepped forward: "Listen, Kanoko, no matter how much you try to hide and conceal, the evidence makes it clear. Last night, when our lord plotted to deceive and kill Kinchō, I secretly went to Kinchō's dwelling to ascertain the truth. Then I saw you transform into a deer and secretly enter, appearing to be having some kind of confidential discussion.

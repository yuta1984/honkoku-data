　Along with the matter of the tanuki Kawashima Sakuemon's military prowess

Now, Kinchō had entered into Senkichi's body and was staying at Yamato's place. During the day he would help with work all day long, and when night came he would tell stories of the past and present to the village elders and youth, and the household members, and when he explained their meanings, everything was so clear that all the people were deeply impressed. At that time, it was the end of the fourth month of Tenpō 10 (1839),

Kinchō appeared before his host Mojūrō, placed both hands on the ground, and said: "I have been in your care for a very long time, and I am deeply grateful that you are even planning to build a shrine for me. Regarding this matter, I still lack sufficient official rank. However, recently the tanuki Tsuda-ura Rokuemon has been promoting the Ana Kannon and is exclusively granting official positions to various tanuki. I would like to go to Tsuda, rely on that Rokuemon, and quickly apply for the official title of Shōichii (Senior First Rank)

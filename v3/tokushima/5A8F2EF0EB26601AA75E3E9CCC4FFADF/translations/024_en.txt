Kanoko restrained Kinchō and said, "Even though you may have the vigor of Xiang Yu and the strategic wisdom of Kongming or Sun Wu, you are but one. The enemy has shut themselves up in the Hole Kannon temple with three or four hundred of their clan followers, so this is quite a dangerous matter. I hear that Fan Li of Yue endured his anger once and later avenged his humiliation at Kuaiji. You should do likewise—return once to Hibiraki Field, gather your allied clan members, and then attack again. At that time, I too will betray them and certainly strike down Rokuemon."

He admonished him in various ways, and since Kinchō was originally wise, he was convinced by this reasoning and said, "Truly, your remonstrance has dispelled the confusion in my heart. Then I shall follow your counsel, return for now, and attack again. However, since I wish to convey this intention to Rokuemon's side, would you deliver this letter to Rokuemon?" He took squid ink and swiftly wrote a letter on a lotus leaf, handed it to Kanoko, and said, "Return quickly before you are discovered."

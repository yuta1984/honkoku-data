　　　　　The mother of Matsudaira Geki died yesterday. Regarding this relationship, she was actually my aunt,
　　　　　but since I became the adopted son of Hyōbu-taifu,
　　　　　the relationship differs. However, based on the actual family relationship, I will observe half mourning periods.
　　　　　I hereby notify you of this.
　　　　　　　Taboo period {{from August 27th to September 6th}}
　　　　　　　Mourning period {{from August 27th to October 12th}}
　　　　　The above is correct.

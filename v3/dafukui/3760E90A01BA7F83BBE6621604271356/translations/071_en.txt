Due to confusing circumstances, Mataemon again inquired and established this matter.

1. If the visitor is of high-ranking retainer status, whether going personally or sending a messenger, notification must be given to the inspectors through verbal report/messenger (different handwriting).

　1. On August 16th, Hōreki 10th year, when Castle Keeper Sasaji Tamon was under discretionary confinement, high-ranking retainer Ogino Magoemon served as visitor, following the above procedure.

1. If the visitor is of council member status, notification must be made by letter. 《Marginal note: 1. From March to April, Kansei 4th year, when Ōban guard Sakai Sanemon was under house confinement, visitor Senior Councilor Sakai Jūnosuke》

1. Even when visiting someone of different rank from a retainer, the notification procedure from the visitor remains unchanged.

　1. Record from April 13th, Kan'en 4th year: For visits among yoriki colleagues, matters are concluded by reporting to their respective heads according to previous precedent.

【Red ink】※ See the seal on the third page following. No one reports who will serve as visitor. However, there are no suitable visitors among yoriki colleagues. If visiting from among unrelated retainers, that visitor must report to the inspectors, according to the handling by Monthly Duty Officer Kumagai Kohyōe. 《Marginal note: Honda Minbu's yoriki Niwa Gotayū under discretionary confinement, visitor Sakai Geki's yoriki Hata Matazaemon; same person's yoriki Satō Kintayū under discretionary confinement, visitor same yoriki Miyake Jūzaemon》

　1. On May 11th, Meiwa 6th year, when Palace Guard scribe Katayama Sezaemon had his samurai status stripped and was demoted to foot soldier with confinement, his biological brother Katayama Yagoemon petitioned and served as visitor.

　1. Monthly Duty Officer Mitera Yoemon on November 20th: When Kotsuzuka Nirazuka Rokusuke was under punishment, Ōban guard Nirazuka Riemon served as visitor.

1. From around Meiwa 3rd-4th years, when retainers permanently stationed at Reiganjima in Edo were ordered discretionary confinement or house arrest, since this was Edo business, many had no relatives or connections within the same residence compound. Therefore, duty partners or close acquaintances petitioned for visitation. Initially this was one person, but since one person caused difficulties with duty messengers and such, in recent years two people have been petitioned for and granted. Refer to the Edo punishment section.

1. Regarding visitation while those punished in Edo remain in custody at their residence, this appears in the section on Edo punishment custody.

1. In January, Bunsei 2nd year, when Shimada Kyūma was under discretionary confinement, visitor Sasaji Hyōgo reported sending a representative. When this was inquired to Duty Officer Ōtani Tange, he was told that sending representatives was inappropriate, so this was communicated to Hyōgo.

　　However, among council members, the practice of representatives apparently exists, but this time it was changed as above.

　　Addendum: For high-ranking retainers, sending representatives is proper, and going personally is also proper.

1. In April, Bunsei 12th year, when Aizawa Shōzaemon was ordered house confinement, since his relatives for visitation were all office holders and various objections were raised with no visitation arranged, the guard commander reported to the senior councilors that inspection should be conducted by non-office-holding residence guard colleagues, and colleagues began making inspection visits. However, since such matters were unprecedented and relatives could not reach agreement, subsequently as per the attached document, Senior Councilors instructed Monthly Duty Inspector Ōsaki Shichitayū to communicate to the relatives. Shichitayū communicated to relative Ichimura Kyūtarō as per the attached document, whereupon after immediate consultation, Oguri Sukeshichi petitioned for visitation. Consequently, relatives also submitted an inquiry regarding discretionary confinement.

　　　　　Attached Document

　　Regarding Aizawa Shōzaemon being ordered house confinement, while visitation should have been promptly petitioned, the delay occurred because relatives failed to adequately consult among themselves, which is most inappropriate. Originally, when misconduct occurs and visitation during punishment is granted as petitioned through special compassion based on family bonds, there may be those in positions such as officials, pages, attendants, and other daily intensive duties who unavoidably find it difficult to petition. To generally assume that serving in office makes petitioning difficult may be customary, but this is a grave misunderstanding. Primarily, failing to understand the principle of compassion is the height of disrespect. However, this matter will not be brought to official attention. The above must be communicated without fail by each to the rela-

House Arrest and Confinement

1. Kyōhō 15, year of the dog, 9th month, 21st day: Regarding Shimada Uemon, whose service in attending the lord did not accord with his lordship's wishes, the lord's intentions were conveyed through messengers Sasaji Gonemon and Mizutani Oribu to Sakai Genba, and the matter was promptly handled. Before conveying the lord's intentions to Gonemon and Oribu, Kōzuki Busaemon was summoned before the lord, who stated: "Although Shimada Uemon's service has long failed to meet my expectations, I have shown considerable forbearance until now. However, it has become difficult to continue in this manner." Therefore, the lord's intentions were later conveyed to the senior councilors through Gonemon and Oribu. Since you also serve as deputy, this is being communicated to you so that you may understand accordingly.

However, Uemon was pardoned from disfavor on the 15th day of the 9th month of Genbun 3, year of the horse.

However, on the 3rd day of the 12th month of Enkyō 1, year of the rat, when it was reported that Yamakawa Sengi had died of illness, although he had been under reprimand, his disfavor was pardoned due to his family status.

Matters to be reported:

1. In Kanpō 2 (Year of the Dog), what was announced to Okabe Sazen's section was that when there are those who have received domain confiscation or dismissal, relatives visiting such persons should be reported immediately, and this should be received, noted, and reported to the senior councilors.

1. Genbun 5 (Year of the Monkey), 11th month, 11th day: When Tsukaya Gengorōemon was granted dismissal, there were instructions from Okabe Sazen's section to handle it the same as domain confiscation.
　　According to Jinbei's analysis, Tsukaya Gengorōemon received domain confiscation. This clause is questionable.

1. When Nishio Jinbē was granted dismissal, he returned home from the council chamber, went to the lower area, and two group members were sent.

1. Ban Shingozaemon received domain confiscation. The group leader announced this at the council chamber with inspectors in attendance, and signatures were taken on the confinement document. To have him retire to the requested temple Honmyōji, at eight o'clock they went to the lower area and handed over his swords, so ashigaru inspectors were not sent, only group members.

1. Suyama Yogozaemon and Tagawa Kintayū: Regular dismissal was granted and handled according to regulations. Until Kintayū returned from the council chamber to Matsuoka, two group members from here were assigned, and from there to the domain border, surveillance and residence attendants from Matsuoka group served together.

1. Kyōhō 9 (Year of the Dragon), 10th month, 29th day: Karasawa Uemon, Kuwano Kaemon, and Hyōsuke were granted dismissal. The group leader announced this at the council chamber with inspectors in attendance, and signatures were taken on confinement documents and pledges to remain within the domain territory. For Hyōsuke, the ashigaru leader announced this in the map room with inspectors in attendance and took signatures on confinement documents. All three did not return to their lodgings, and from the council chamber to the checkpoint, two surveillance group members each were assigned, group members were also attached to residences, and notification was sent to the residence magistrate. {{Marginal note: The aforementioned Kaemon retired to Fukushōji temple in Yoshie Ushiya village, where he committed suicide on the night of the last day of the following month. Although there should have been no confinement since dismissal was granted, because little time had passed since dismissal, two group members were sent to investigate whether there were any written notes, etc.}}

1. Genroku 14 (Year of the Snake): Takano Jinzaemon was granted dismissal for not attending duty.

1. Same 17th year (Year of the Monkey): Okajima Tahē and his two sons received domain confiscation. Confinement documents for retirement to three locations. Over 10,000 koku.

1. Same year: Ideura Gengorōemon【Red correction】Shinemon was granted dismissal and was residing in Tochiizumi village when it became known that he had died of illness, so this was reported to his lordship. For the aforementioned Shinemon □□
　　Assistant Okuyama Shichirōemon was summoned, and regarding the condition of illness from last winter and the course of medical treatment, Shichirōemon was made to write a detailed oral report for review. Shichirōemon affixed his seal to this oral report.

1. Hōei 2 (Year of the Rooster): Group leader Kawagoe Uemon【Red notation】as inspector was granted dismissal and remained in Kaminakamura.

1. Same 3rd year (Year of the Dog): A court lady attending Seishōin visited Kitano village Tenjin shrine as proxy worship, then went to view wisteria at Oka. Since Matsue Zenbē did not report this to the monthly inspector, his position was revoked. Daigen Sen'emon was granted dismissal.

1. Same year: Nakanishi Kansuke reported chronic illness and constantly left his post without informing the group leader, so he was granted dismissal. He also failed to attend seasonal service and rode in a palanquin without permission during memorial service for Lord Daianin.

1. Shōtoku 2 (Year of the Dragon), 1st month, 29th day: Edo permanent residence court acupuncturist Satō Teijun had misconduct and was granted dismissal. He returned to the official residence, packed his belongings, and before Teijun's departure, group members were assigned as before, and surveillance members were also sent to Teijun's hut.
　　However, until this time, those receiving domain confiscation, banishment, and regular dismissal were all handled the same way, so it was said that Koma Ise's section should be consulted. When Ōno Sanzaemon made the inquiry, it was ordered that such distinctions should be established, so regarding Teijun's case, it was reported in the official correspondence as stated above.【Red notation】◎ See mark two pages earlier

1. Same 3rd year (Year of the Snake): Ishiguro Nasaemon repeatedly submitted petitions with matters that showed disrespect for superiors, which did not meet with approval, so he was dismissed.
　　However, this was stricter than regular dismissal - he was to retire to a temple and additionally had confinement documents with signatures imposed. The original document was kept by head falconer Kishi Mōzaemon.

1. Same 4th year (Year of the Horse): The son Taemon of Yoshitake【Ii?】 Kanemon absconded, claiming to be a deserter, and went to relatives in Kaga Province for help. However, they said they could not accommodate him without proper documentation from Kanemon, so he returned.

However, even when announcements are made at magistrates' residences, inspectors should go there.

1. When dismissal has been announced and completed, the inspector should immediately notify the residence magistrate.

1. In Tenmei 7 (Year of the Sheep), when dismissals, domain confiscations, etc. were ordered, there had been cases where people were not sent to other places or domains, so the senior councilors inquired whether there were established regulations for such positions from earlier times. However, since no such established regulations from earlier times were known, it was reported that such matters were decided by council deliberation at the time. Subsequently, it was announced that when such cases arise in the future, inspectors should consult together and submit a report identifying official positions that would be difficult to send to other domains or places. It was reported that generally it would probably be as follows, and that matters marked with ・ might be acceptable depending on the individual and the council's deliberation at the time.

1. Kyōhō 21 (Year of the Dragon), 6th month, 25th day《Marginal note: Genbun 1》: Regarding court lady Koshikibu, also known as Shungyokuin, when dismissal was granted, it was announced by the senior councilors that travel permits for Itatori checkpoint should be examined and issued. However, until now there had been no cases of immediately issuing permits when women were dismissed, so from whom should guarantees be obtained to issue permits? For banished women, permits are issued without guarantees. In such precedents, for wives of dismissed samurai, when they gradually move to other domains, permits are issued with family guarantee documents, but what should be done? When this was reported to Matsudaira Shume's section, it was announced that like banished women, guarantee documents were not necessary and permits should be issued, and this should be conveyed to Ōmiya Hikouemon. This was conveyed to Hikouemon and recorded. However, since Shungyokuin's brother Kuki Sazaemon was granted dismissal, Shungyokuin was also granted dismissal.

Kansei 4 (Year of the Rat), 10th month, 25th day: When Tsuchiya Shinnosuke was granted dismissal, since his father Gorōtayū had served long in domain service, a ten-person stipend was granted to his relative Ishihara Kurōzaemon's younger brother Torazō as successor to the family name. Since said Torazō was 12 years old, when he reaches 15, would the rice stipend of 25 koku and 5-person stipend also be adjusted? ○ Torazō was reportedly 9 years old, and being extremely young, during the punishment period it was requested that he be taken in by Kurōzaemon and kept under restraint.

1. For visiting the residences of those granted dismissal at that time and giving various instructions, even for samurai, urgent petitions are not necessary to the inspectors.

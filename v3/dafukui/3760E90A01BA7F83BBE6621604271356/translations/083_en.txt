conspired with this person and absconded. When this was heard, last month he was entrusted to his father Bunzaemon and investigated by group officials,
　　and there was no discrepancy. He confessed that he had been asked by these women to help them, so as the son of a minor servant who helped colleagues abscond,
　　this was extremely improper conduct, and he was ordered expelled from the castle town and five ri in all directions.
　　　However, when Saburōemon's group sub-head conveyed this to Bunji, two members of the duty group were sent to Saburōemon's group sub-head to witness,
　　　　and Saburōemon's group sub-head made the announcement. As Bunji was to leave immediately, two group members were sent to confirm,
　　　　and he settled at the residence of rice merchant Saemon in Akemachi, Fuchū side post town.

1. Bunka 5 (Year of the Dragon), 10th month, 25th day: Kumagai Kohei's charge, ninja Kumai Jinzaemon's third son Kojūrō, who had
　absconded five years earlier, was brought back. His father and others submitted a petition with Kohei's written statement requesting permission to re-enter the domain, but it was not accepted.
　Domain expulsion was ordered according to law. When this was conveyed to Kojūrō, two duty group members were sent to the ninja group sub-head's residence to witness, and also
　two were sent to confirm the expulsion. However, Kojūrō was severely ill and could not leave, so Kohei inquired what should be done. As it was night,
　this was noted, and the next morning his father Jinzaemon and relatives submitted a petition with Kohei's accompanying statement requesting custody.
　After further investigation, there was no discrepancy, so this was reported to the senior councilors and the expulsion was postponed. On the 24th day of the 12th month,
　relatives petitioned through a doctor's statement that he had not yet recovered and wished to continue treatment into the new year, as Kohei
　reported. After consultation among colleagues and discussion with the senior councilors, the petition was granted, and Kojūrō would be expelled upon recovery,
　as was conveyed to Kohei.

1. Kansei 8 (Year of the Dragon), 9th month, 23rd day, as follows: Memorandum of verbal statement

　　My group member Ueda Kizō's adoptive father Kihēji has committed extremely improper conduct, so I petitioned earlier and had him confined, but there were increasingly inappropriate actions,
　　so I petitioned to expel him from the castle town. The petition was granted and I was told to handle it at my discretion, for which I am most grateful. Accordingly, I ordered expulsion through group officials,
　　but his chronic illness recurred and he became irrational as if deranged, making communication impossible, so unavoidably I wished to wait until his illness subsided,
　　as I reported earlier. However, due to this illness his irrationality has increased, and I have no way to handle this. Therefore, I humbly request that the authorities
　　order the expulsion of this Kihēji out of compassion. Reporting such matters is extremely improper and I am deeply ashamed. Please
　　handle these matters appropriately. Above
　　　　　　　　　To Arakawa Sukeemon-sama　9th month, 23rd day　　Aizawa Hachirōemon

　Although this was submitted, since petitions had been made repeatedly from the beginning, which was quite improper, this statement was returned to Hachirōemon by colleagues only, and it was suggested that he should
　consult well with fellow vanguard unit commanders. On the 25th of the same month, two monthly vanguard unit commanders again submitted a written statement:
　　Aizawa Hachirōemon's group [omitted] As irrationality is increasing, Hachirōemon's repeated reports are also shameful, so we have consulted and wish to order expulsion.
　　Depending on circumstances, there may be cases requiring arrest before petition, so we will send our group members to consult with Hachirōemon's group. When handling this, please
　　have your group members assist. Above
　　　　　　　　　9th month, 25th day　　To Arakawa Sukeemon-sama　　Higuchi Kizaemon
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sakakibara Sukezaemon

　As this was submitted, it was reported to the senior councilors, who said to handle it at discretion, so this was conveyed to both men, and two group members were sent when the announcement was made.
　However, Hachirōemon quickly submitted a petition of restraint inquiry, but was told restraint was unnecessary and to refrain.

1. Genbun 3 (Year of the Horse), 11th month, 21st day: The timekeeper's assistant at the third citadel had stomach pain and dizziness, made an error and struck six o'clock twice. Town magistrate Tsuchiya Jūrōemon confined him and inquired of the senior councilors, who said that since it was
　an illness, he should be pardoned this time and ordered to be careful in the future. Note: conveyed through the inspector.

1. Meiwa 4 (Year of the Boar), 11th month, 12th day: In Edo, today the 12th, when the lord made a procession to the Senjū area and passed the front gate, on the return he forgot to guide to the middle entrance [entrance between the main entrance and kitchen entrance], which was improper conduct, so
　confinement was ordered. On the 18th of the same month, it was declared through the middle councilor that although Izaemon's stipend should be revoked, out of compassion his allocation was reduced and he was given seven koku and two-person stipend,
　temporarily assigned to the reserve group, and would later be appointed to an appropriate position, as was conveyed.

1. Kaei 4 (Year of the Boar), 4th month, 18th day: Minagawa Heiemon's group sub-head Matsukawa Heisuke conducted target practice with Hasegawa Hachijūrō's disciple at Atago Mountain, so witnesses should have been provided,
　but this was forgotten and none were sent. After inquiry, confinement was ordered.

and personal belongings should be handed over to Sōzaemon after consultation with Hori Chōbee, the office custodian, as ordered to ashigaru-metsuke Yamura Jinzaemon.

1. In Kyōwa 3 (Year of the Boar), 10th month: Regarding the adopted son Shikibu of Nagami Rokurōuemon, who was previously banished, there was an internal request through Shizuma of the same name to receive the confiscated swords and personal belongings. When this was reported to the senior retainers, they instructed to handle it as internally requested. Therefore, a letter was sent to Rokurōuemon's household instructing them to appear at the accounting office at 4 o'clock the next day to receive the items. Accordingly, ashigaru-metsuke Ban Gorozaemon was told to handle it properly when they came to collect the next day, and Hori Chōbee was also told to consult on the matter. When they immediately came to collect, Gorozaemon reported that he supervised the handover of the swords, personal belongings, etc. <<Marginal note: There was a receipt from Rokurōuemon's retainer>>

1. Regarding requests from parents to recall banished sons
1. In Bunsei 12 (Year of the Ox), 10th month: Concerning Yūsuke, son of Hahakabe Yasohachi, who was banished in Bunsei 10 (Year of the Boar) due to being an unworthy person at Yasohachi's request, a verbal petition was submitted requesting his recall as his character had apparently reformed. This was granted as requested. Note that this recall request came after Yasohachi's second son Kyūbee <<Marginal note: originally named Takichi>> had succeeded to the family headship.
However, regarding Yūsuke, while there should have been official pronouncement from above initially, since the banishment was carried out by prior petition, he was pardoned this time. In reality, he had run away and was brought back, after which a petition for banishment was immediately submitted.

1. On the 8th day of the 7th month of Tempō 2 (Year of the Rabbit): Sakai Gonzaemon submitted the following petition:
Vertical document: Regarding my son Hisaya's improper conduct, I petition for his banishment from the domain. While there should be methods of admonishment, I am ashamed that these have not worked. Please convey these circumstances appropriately to the senior retainers. The above.
7th month, 8th day
To Imamura Gobee-sama     Sakai Gonzaemon

This was submitted to the residence of duty officer Matsudaira Shume, so colleagues were told to deliberate and report. Upon deliberation, since this was a petition, it was reported that it should be granted as requested. Previously, during residence periods, inquiries were made to Edo, but since this was a parent's petition, no inquiry was made, so this time it was announced without inquiry. Also, regarding whether Gonzaemon's self-restraint should be inquired about, and how it should be handled, the colleagues reported that since no details were heard from Gonzaemon, it was unnecessary, and if details emerged later, punishment from above would be appropriate. However, after deliberation by the senior retainers, when Gonzaemon submitted his self-restraint inquiry, house confinement was ordered. Three days perhaps.

1. On the 23rd day of the 6th month of Tempō 5 (Year of the Horse): The following deliberation was established regarding self-restraint inquiries when children, younger brothers, etc. are petitioned to leave the domain:
1. When I petition for children, younger brothers, etc. to leave the domain and then submit self-restraint inquiries out of fear, house confinement should be ordered if there are no special circumstances.
1. When birth family parents, brothers, etc. submit self-restraint inquiries for the same reason, if there are no special circumstances, it should be immediately announced that this is unnecessary.
However, for those who are close attendants, during absence years this should be handled immediately the same way; during residence years, after reporting to his lordship and inquiring about his wishes, it should be announced that this is unnecessary. For other household relatives, even if they are uncles, nephews, or brothers, they need not submit self-restraint inquiries - only the head of that house should submit inquiries, whether for adopted or birth children. However, the head of the birth family should submit inquiries regardless of whether the relationship is parent-child, sibling, or even uncle-nephew relationships.

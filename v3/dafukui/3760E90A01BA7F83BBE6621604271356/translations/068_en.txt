Inquiry Matters

1. On June 16th, Tenpō 4th year, when Urai Gohee's adopted son Nabeshirō was ordered to retire from the domain and Gohee was also ordered discretionary confinement, Kurosawa Nobujirō, being Gohee's actual nephew, should have submitted an inquiry, but since his birth father Suzuki Kurōemon was in mourning, relative Yumata Yagōemon submitted the inquiry on his behalf.

1. At the same time, Suzuki Chōjirō was also Gohee's nephew, but since his father Kurōemon was in mourning and Chōjirō had not yet been granted family headship, no discretionary confinement inquiry was submitted at that time. After being granted family headship on the 29th of the same month, he submitted the inquiry.
However, in my opinion, if a related person's punishment is pardoned before succession to family headship, there should be no need to submit an inquiry after later succession.

1. On September 11th, Tenpō 12th year, when Sawada Kōdayū failed to appear when oath papers for his official duties were ordered, he was ordered discretionary confinement after inquiry. This also appears in the section on various official oath documents.

1. The matter of discretionary confinement inquiry due to forgetting congratulatory letters appears in the congratulations section. Inaba Keijirō.

1. On August 22nd, Bunsei 13th year, regarding Yano Tetsunosuke being ordered discretionary confinement, senior guard commander Nakagawa Rokuzaemon and senior clerk Katō Shigeemon submitted discretionary confinement inquiries and were ordered to refrain. Tetsunosuke's matter appears in the section on cohabitation during punishment.
The details are as follows: on the 19th at five o'clock, when Tetsunosuke should have reported for guard duty, he fell ill en route and did not report for duty. He immediately reported this situation to the duty leader, but although it was illness, it constituted tardiness and created a gap in guard duty, so they inquired whether discretionary confinement should be sought. Following the duty leader's guidance, the inquiry should have been submitted to the unit commander through the senior clerk, but Tetsunosuke failed to properly inform the duty leader about his illness and absence. Around noon, he went to Shigeemon and reported this, submitting an inquiry document. Shigeemon should have confirmed with Tetsunosuke whether communications with the duty leader had been completed before proceeding, but without doing so, he submitted it directly to the unit commander. When Rokuzaemon brought it to duty officer Okabe Sazen, complications arose and the matter was referred to colleagues for consultation. Upon investigation, Tetsunosuke's inquiry document was returned due to these circumstances, and he was separately ordered discretionary confinement from above. Rokuzaemon and Shigeemon also submitted discretionary confinement inquiries due to negligent handling of the matter.

1. On May 4th, Bunka 9th year, when Shimosaka Ichizaemon's adopted family cousin Kajikawa Kizaemon was punished, a discretionary confinement inquiry was submitted but was deemed unnecessary.

1. On October 26th, Kyōwa 3rd year, a person named Amaya Jinzaemon from Inspector Imamura Denbee's unit was ordered confinement due to negligence regarding official notices. I am deeply concerned about this matter, so I reported that I wished to refrain from duty, but was told it was unnecessary.

1. Regarding relatives' discretionary inquiries when unit members are punished, this appears in the section on unit member punishments.

1. In February, Bunka 6th year, when naval unit member Ikeda Shigedayū absconded but was brought back and subsequently had his stipend revoked, resulting in punishment for the petty officers and others, unit commander Suō Chōbee was ordered to refrain after inquiry. This also appears in the absconding section.

1. On February 16th of the same year, when minor equipment attendants and palanquin attendants were punished for gambling, the escort commander inquired about refraining but was told it was unnecessary.

1. In April, Bunka 2nd year, when Isono Tamiya was on duty on the 17th during his lordship's palace departure, there was negligence in properly reporting ritual pollution inspections, so he was ordered to refrain after inquiry.

1. In December, Bunka 4th year, when there was punishment, Ōtani Yoshiyori of unified rank submitted a discretionary inquiry, but since he was of unified rank, it should go to the senior councilors...

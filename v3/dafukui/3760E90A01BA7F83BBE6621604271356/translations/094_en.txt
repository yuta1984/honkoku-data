From his office, the punishment document for the aforementioned Gorōbei, along with guarantor and registrar documents, were transmitted to the guarantor's administrative head, town magistrate Arakawa Jūemon.
Accordingly, each matter was announced from Jūemon's office. However, since Denbei was the monthly duty officer that month, the handling was as described above.

1. On March 18th of the 13th year of Bunsei (1830), the senior councilors announced that when farmers and townspeople commit discourtesy toward members of the samurai household, if confinement or imprisonment is reported to town magistrates and district magistrates, henceforth such matters should be reported from their jurisdiction to the senior councilors. This was communicated to Ogino Nabehachirō of Koma Tatewaki's office, who served as duty officer. Regarding this matter, whereas previously administrative heads only reported to magistrates, henceforth they should also report to senior councilors, and this was communicated to all those with administrative authority.

1. In May of the 2nd year of Tenpō (1831), a retainer of Sakai Yosazaemon requested permission to banish a farmer from Yosazaemon's domain. When this was brought to the duty officer, the response was that it was at his discretion. This decision was communicated to Yosazaemon's retainer who was summoned, and Yosazaemon reported this to the district magistrate.
This handling was the same as the banishment case of Imasuke, a servant of Koma Mokutaka, in March of the 13th year of Bunsei. This appears in the section on retainer banishment.

1. In July of the 2nd year of Tenpō (1831), regarding fines for residents of temple gate towns on vermillion seal land, a private inquiry was made to Temples and Shrines Magistrate Wakizaka Nakatsukasa-no-Taiyu, who responded with the following attached note:
When there are disputes between residents of temple gate towns on vermillion seal temple lands within the domain and domain residents, and after settlement both parties are fined, should the fines from gate town residents be submitted to the domain lord, or should the fines be submitted to the temple? We would like to inquire privately about this for future reference.
July [Signed] In the name of the lord, Caretaker's name

Attached note:
Regarding disputes between residents of temple gate towns on vermillion seal lands attached to your domain and your domain residents, when fines are imposed after investigation and settlement, it is acceptable for the domain lord to collect fines from gate town residents as well.

1. In May of the Tenpō era, regarding the confiscation of stolen goods and pawned items, documents submitted by foot magistrates and records of various documents:
Explanation:
There have been ongoing consultations between the town office and three-district office regarding the handling of stolen goods and pawned items, but they cannot reach agreement using the old regulations. These regulations were established during Kobayashi Matauemon's tenure as town magistrate and were not officially proclaimed from above. However, after the official proclamation of regulations on stolen goods and pawned items was issued via official documents in the 8th year of Bunsei (1825), the old regulations no longer apply, and matters should be handled according to the proclaimed official documents. If this is the case, then the official documents from 1825 should take precedence over the town office's old regulations. The 1825 regulations should be upheld and applied to both town and three-district areas. However, depending on actual circumstances, there may be cases difficult to handle according to the regulations, so depending on the nature of investigation records, there may be ways to handle matters through bilateral consultation. In any case, regardless of whether one has or lacks permanent residence, how about ordering that matters be handled according to the 1825 regulations?
May, Foot Magistrates

Official document proclaimed by the household in March of the 3rd year of Jōkyō (1686):

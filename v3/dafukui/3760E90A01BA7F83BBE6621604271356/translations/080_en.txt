Punishments and Censures for Group Members and Below

1. Kyōhō 11 (Year of the Horse), during the 8th, 9th, and 10th months: When Yasugi Kakutayū of Nakamura Tarōzaemon's group struck an arako (young man) in the side during cormorant fishing, he was ordered confined.
   Later, when the arako's wound healed, the confinement was lifted. Two bu in gold was given by Kakutayū to the arako as medical expenses. There are continuous records. 《Marginal note: However, the head reported that it would be troublesome if fines were to be imposed in the future as well》

1. Same [Kyōhō] 18 (Year of the Ox): A retainer of Sakai Genba named Takahashi Danzō counterfeited money, and since this was a serious crime,
   he was presented to higher authorities. Regarding this matter, Ishikawa Shōtayū of Nishio Gentazaemon's group, who was Danzō's brother-in-law,
   was serving duty in Edo at that time, so he was ordered to exercise restraint. When inquiring whether a guard should also be assigned, it was declared that
   restraint should be ordered but assigning a guard was unnecessary.

1. Genbun 2 (Year of the Snake), 6th month: A written directive was issued from Edo as follows:
   Recently, among various groups, those who committed misconduct were dealt with respectively after investigation. Regarding this, some group supervisors' conduct has been
   driven by personal gain, not wishing for the benefit of their superiors, and moreover, showing no concern for the difficulties of their heads, their conduct being improper.
   This matter has been under investigation for some time, but henceforth, everyone should pay attention, and those unsuitable among group supervisors should
   have their stipends revoked and be replaced before any guidance from above. Naturally, if everyone exercises good judgment,
   having superiors issue specific orders would cause particular trouble for the heads. Since it was declared that this matter should be communicated to everyone,
   this should be understood accordingly.

1. Same [Genbun] 5 (Year of the Monkey): A vanguard of Oguri Hachibe's group was crossing through the county area leading a prisoner in chains and passed through the North Gate of the Sannomaru,
   causing his stipend to be revoked. Gate guard Sodekawa Yozaemon of vanguard Hayashi Matazaemon's group was ordered to be confined. There are records.

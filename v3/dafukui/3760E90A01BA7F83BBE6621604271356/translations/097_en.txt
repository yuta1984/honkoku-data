When there are cases that are difficult to determine, they should be handled after making an inquiry, as instructed by Inspector (metsuke) Hasebe Koemon.

Attached paper inquiry:
When those who act as intermediaries for pawned items bring pawned goods using the names of reliable residents from specific towns or villages, even if the pawnshop knows them well, should separate guarantors still be taken? Or if the pawnshop reliably knows the person's residence and identity, would that person serve as guarantor, making it unnecessary to establish separate guarantors?

When the above inquiry was made to the Inspector via attached paper, Hasebe Koemon consulted with the senior councilors and conveyed the following: If the person bringing pawned items has reliable residence and identity information and is someone the pawnshop reliably knows and recognizes, that person can serve as guarantor and it is unnecessary to establish separate guarantors - this should be the pawnshop's understanding. Without this arrangement, normal handling of pawned items would be difficult, which is reasonable. However, if there is suspicion that items might be stolen, even for persons reliably known, extra care should be taken to secure separate guarantors. Given this principle, when it comes to investigating stolen goods and pawnshops, it is appropriate that there should be guarantors separate from those who brought the pawned items.

1. When goods stolen in other provinces or domains are pawned at pawnshops within our domain through intermediaries from our domain, and there is a claim from the other party requesting return, such cases should generally be handled according to the above principles. When goods stolen within our domain are pawned at pawnshops in other provinces or domains through intermediaries, and we make claims for their recovery, even if we press our case according to our regulations, the other party likely has their own regulations, so matters should be handled according to circumstances.

However, since the above regulations were privately received from official government channels, it is difficult to openly insist on following these regulations exactly. Nevertheless, for areas directly under government control (goryō) and areas under government custody (azukari-sho), it is acceptable to press claims strictly according to these regulations.

However, if the guarantor cannot produce the compensation money, their house, property, etc. should be sold and personal bankruptcy declared. For any remaining shortfall in the original money, the theft victim should pay half and the pawnshop should bear half as loss. If there are no guarantors or the pawning was done carelessly, the pawnshop should bear the financial loss and additionally be punished.

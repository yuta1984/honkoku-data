However, if other domains are involved, inquiry must be made to the monthly duty senior councilor. For criminals to be sentenced to remote island exile, if there are no islands within the domain, they shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or placed in strict custody of relatives. {{Note: Also, regarding compassion for living creatures, as has been repeatedly ordered, this must be strictly observed and carefully enforced - 6th month of the Year of the Ox}}

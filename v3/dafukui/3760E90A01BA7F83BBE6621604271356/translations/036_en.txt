1. Tenpō 14, rabbit year, 11th month, 29th day: House arrest for Jūrōsuke, adoptive father of Sakai Sagenta [marginal note: of retired status]
   Following inquiry, restraint for Sakai Sagenta
   However, relatives up to cousins must submit inquiries

   Until now, it has been customary for relatives up to cousins to submit inquiries regarding those sentenced to house arrest. When Kurusu Shōemon was sentenced to house arrest, there was precedent for cousins to submit inquiries. However, there are no firm regulations. Originally, house arrest is a severe punishment, and for those in service, succession by a legitimate heir would be appointed and they would not serve again - it being particularly severe. Therefore, it was decided through deliberation that henceforth, for house arrest cases, inquiries for restraint should be submitted by relatives up to cousins.

1. In the intercalary eighth month of the second year of Bunka (1805), regarding criminal punishments for townspeople and villagers (machi-zai), although previous directives existed, due to recent confusion, revisions were made following deliberations by the senior councilors, and written instructions as follows were distributed to the various administrative heads, conveyed by Murata Jūtayū, and communicated to Arakawa Jūemon by express messenger.

Regarding Criminal Punishment of Townspeople and Villagers:
1. Confinement, fines, shackles, house arrest, seclusion, prohibition from visiting others, imprisonment
1. Banishment from the castle town
1. Banishment from the castle town and home village: 3 ri, 5 ri, 7 ri, 10 ri radius

For the above, when administrative heads make inquiries, if there are no complications, decisions may be rendered immediately through single-seat deliberation as requested.
However, if there are complications, or for townspeople and villagers of good standing and family background, deliberations may extend to include magistrates or, depending on the case, commissioners.

1. Banishment within the domain to 13 ri radius
This shall be handled after deliberation with magistrates and reporting to higher authorities.

1. Tattooing and banishment
Same as above.

1. Death penalty, exposure of severed head, death by fire, crucifixion
Same as above.

Regarding Criminal Punishment of Those Who Return:
1. For those banished from castle town to 7 ri radius who are subject to renewed banishment within the domain, if there are no complications when making inquiry, decisions may be rendered immediately through single-seat deliberation as requested.

1. For those banished to 10 ri radius, when inquiring about banishment to 13 ri radius within the domain, since they are already once-banished persons, if there are no complications, decisions may be rendered immediately through single-seat deliberation as requested.

1. When inquiring about tattooing and banishment for those banished from the domain, if there are no complications, same as the previous clause.

1. The return of those subjected to tattooing and banishment warrants the death penalty.

1. For those who repeatedly returned for minor offenses and finally received domain banishment, if they are extremely foolish persons or have returned due to illness and wander about as beggars with no other wrongdoing, after special deliberation, tattooing may be waived and domain banishment may be imposed again.

1. When those with light banishment become seriously ill and their relatives and village or town officials petition for pardon, if the administrative head investigates and reports, pardon shall be handled immediately. Of course, if they recover, they shall be exiled again; if they die of illness, this shall be reported at that time, and magistrates shall also be informed.

as communicated by Genba." At the office, group members take turns in attendance, and official duties are handled by colleagues." Togo Niemon reported: "Since Jinzaemon has been ordered under house arrest, and Niemon is his brother, how should this be handled? Last year in Edo, when Kosaka Magoshichi was placed under house arrest, family members did not need to inquire about restraint, and naturally visitors were not admitted. Therefore, how should passage be handled this time?" In response to this inquiry, the reply was: "Since this is house arrest ordered from above, it should be handled the same as inquiry and restraint, as communicated by Genba, so this should be understood accordingly." However, regarding passage to Jinzaemon's residence, this was communicated from Niemon's side, and this was again formally reported. On the last day of the same month, Jinzaemon was pardoned from house arrest.

However, regarding this matter, on the 9th day of the 7th month of Enkyo 3rd year (Year of the Tiger), when Senior Ashigaru Commander Oka Saburoemon was ordered to remain in restraint regarding gate duties, Saburoemon only exercised personal restraint and did not request permission for any passage. At this time, after deliberation, it was determined that inquiry and restraint, namely house arrest, are all lightly imposed punishments, so following Saburoemon's handling, henceforth for house arrest there is no need to request passage permissions, as communicated by Minbu, with details reaching the lord's attention, and this was established as precedent for the future.

Pawned items should be accepted. If stolen goods are discovered and the depositor's address is unknown with no verbal agreement, the money should be treated as the pawnshop's loss, and the pawned item should be returned to the theft victim. If the depositor comes forward or a guarantor is brought forth, the money should be received and the pawned item returned as determined through investigation.

1. Even if various craftsmen bring pawned items, items that appear to be custom orders for their trade or items that seem to be rental work should never be accepted. Generally, if there are items inappropriate for the depositor, they should be carefully examined before acceptance. Regarding intermediation, this is exceptional, but when lost items are found and examined, the depositor should come forward immediately.

1. The deadlines for all pawned items are as prescribed. June 8th, two seasons.
December 8th
After this deadline is extended and items are disposed of without the depositor's consent, regardless of any claims made afterward, or even if called stolen goods, the pawnshop bears no responsibility.

The above articles follow previous regulations and should be strictly observed.

District annotation in red: Wondering if this official document might also be a directive from the shogunate, District Magistrate Tōgō Saburōemon inquired with the intelligence officers in Edo, where immediate investigation revealed it was not an official shogunal directive.

1. From the household regulations established in December of the 7th year of An'ei (1778), abbreviated from the section on punishment for those who accept stolen goods as pawns or purchase them.

1. From the revised shogunal regulations of March, 2nd year of Kansei (1790), abbreviated from the section on handling stolen goods and pawned items and their punishments.

From the household directive of November, 2nd year of Kansei (1790):

1. Regarding pawned items and purchases in the castle town and rural areas, while there are established laws, improper handling has been reported. Henceforth, when pawned items or purchases are determined to be stolen goods, they will be confiscated, and those who accepted them as pawns or purchased them will suffer financial loss. Furthermore, depending on the circumstances of handling, punishment may be imposed, so each person should be mindful and handle matters with sincerity and care. When someone brings pawned items or goods for sale that are inappropriate for their status, the matter should be reported to the appropriate authorities, and if there are suspicious circumstances, it should be reported to the supervisory officials. It has also been heard that some accept pawned items privately, but henceforth, even private pawned items, if stolen, will be treated the same as above.
Note: While there have been previous regulations, due to recent laxity, this is now being restated, so both town and rural areas must strictly enforce these controls.

Record of directive documents from Town Magistrate Kobayashi Matauemon in November, 4th year of Kansei (1792):
Note: The following year in the 1st month of the Ox year, pawnshop licenses were established. Thirty-six people pay fifty monme of role silver per pawnshop. The character for "pawn" is written in old script on their shop curtains.

Record of inquiry regarding the handling of stolen goods accepted as pawns and purchased items, comparing new and old practices:

1. When pawnshops inadvertently accept stolen goods, they should have guarantors or intermediaries pay for redemption and return items to theft victims. If intermediaries or guarantors cannot pay for redemption, assets should be seized up to their means and given to the pawnshop. If the shortfall cannot be compensated, at the pawnshop's discretion, after investigation, banishment may be ordered, and all available pawned items should be seized and returned to theft victims. This is the recent regulation.

1. Previously, even when pawnshops had guarantors and witnesses providing verbal guarantees, when pawned items or purchases were found to be stolen goods, after investigation, if the items matched the theft victim's report without discrepancy, the victim was ordered to buy back the items with the original money. If guarantors failed to respond or handling was inappropriate, after investigation the items would be seized and returned to the theft victim, followed by punishment. This has been the regulation from long ago.

Given the above circumstances, perhaps because pawnshops have been particularly careful in recent years, there are few stolen goods in the castle town, or perhaps many are being passed to other domains and provinces...

1. On the 16th day of the 6th month, he went to the castle for the celebratory ceremony of Yoshisada
1. On the 17th day of the same month, for official government business, the village registers of the domain were submitted 
　　to the Ote accounting office through a messenger
1. On the 18th day of the same month, the domain map and castle map were submitted through a messenger to the
　　Nakanokuchi of the castle. Lord Hikosaka Iki-no-kami Shigetsugu received them
1. On the 23rd day of the same month, as it became difficult to repay the money to the Kamigata merchants who had
　　been providing financial assistance for some time, the following was conveyed through the chief retainer to the intermediaries,
　　namely Matsue Zenbei Fusaoka, the Kyoto caretaker, and Kogi Rokubei Sadauji stationed in Otsu

　　　　　　　　　Memorandum
　　　　　There have been loans through various intermediaries since the time of the previous Lord Echizen-no-kami, but with continuous
　　　　　poor harvests in the domain and subsequent unavoidable circumstances, finances have become severely strained, making it
　　　　　difficult to make the previously agreed repayments, which has been a constant source of difficulty.
　　　　　Now that Lord Echizen-no-kami's domain has been confiscated and
　　　　　new territory has been granted to Lord Hyobu-no-taifu, the income has decreased, so there is no way to continue
　　　　　repayments hereafter, and a large amount of gold and silver will be lost.
　　　　　We can imagine how troublesome this must be. Those who continue to manage finances from this point
　　　　　will rely on business for several years and will need special consideration

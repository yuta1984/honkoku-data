The Shogun's Will:
Recently, through Hikosaka Iki-no-kami, we inquired about the condition of Echizen-no-kami's illness.
When we learned that his condition was not favorable and this reached the Shogun's ears,
there shall be severe punishment (ōhō), and his domain shall be confiscated.

We have understood the Shogun's will. We shall immediately inform Echizen-no-kami
and send word quickly to his domain as well.

Lord Masachika accepted this directive, and at that time Lord Kaga-no-kami conveyed
the Shogun's will as follows:

The Shogun's Will:
Regarding the two Hyōbu-taiyu, due to their lineage,
they are newly granted 250,000 koku and entrusted
with Fukui Castle.

Lord Abe Bungo-no-kami (Masatake) again conveyed the following:
Two thousand hyō shall be granted to Echizen-no-kami during his lifetime.

After expressing gratitude for this, there was an exchange with Lord Bingo-no-kami, and they withdrew. Thereafter, to express gratitude, they made courtesy visits to the senior councilors, chamberlains, junior councilors, and attendants.

1. On the 6th day of the intercalary third month: Regarding the same political decision, Taki Kazue (Akinori) and Ishikawa Sōzaemon (Narimasa) were dispatched as express messengers
to the home domain.

Oral Statement Memorandum
Although it was proclaimed that horses should not be abandoned, there were those who violated this, and initially remote island exile was decreed, with punishments gradually imposed. However, as such people still exist today, this is extremely inexcusable, but out of mercy, the same punishment will be decreed this time as well. Both shogunal and private domains shall be strictly instructed, and the essential purpose of compassion for living beings shall be given priority. Hereafter, if anyone abandons horses, depending on the circumstances, it will be the fault of the magistrate or local lord. The above.

should petition while still living. However, for deathbed adoptions of those fifty years old or above and seventeen years old or below,
　such adoptions should be established after consultation. Even if they are
　one's actual children, those whose lineage is inappropriate
　should not be established as heirs
1. Those who have arrangements with their original masters should most certainly not be dealt with. If there are those who seek refuge
　and their original master refuses them, this should be reported to the inspector;
　those guilty of major crimes should be returned, and those guilty of minor crimes should be banished
　　　Note: Wounded persons should not be concealed
1. When there are those to be executed, except for those specifically ordered to attend, no one should

1. Quarrels and arguments represent the height of disloyalty and unfilial conduct. Firmly keep
　this principle in mind. Should such occur, guards on duty should immediately intervene and stop them
　at the scene, and where there are no guards on duty, those nearby should intervene and stop them.
　Those who recklessly gather and take sides will receive punishment heavier
　than the principal offenders
1. Gambling, licentiousness, or posting slanderous writings and documents - such shameful conduct
　unbefitting of samurai should not occur

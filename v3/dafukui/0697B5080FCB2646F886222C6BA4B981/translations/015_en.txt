Senior Retainer [Inaba Uneme], along with Sakai Genba Motochika, Ariga Saemon [?]kata, and Sakai Magoshirō Motonobu were
　　seated in attendance. The content of His Lordship's message to those who were granted leave this time was as follows,
　　which Uneme conveyed:
　　　　Content of His Lordship's Message:　
　　　　　This time new domain territory has been granted, and all of you are
　　　　　long-serving retainers of the house. Though it is His Lordship's desire
　　　　　to employ all of you without exception, the current domain income
　　　　　makes this difficult. His Lordship feels particular compassion
　　　　　for the hardship that those who cannot be retained will face.
　　　　　　　End
　　　　　Since you are not being retained this time, whether you remain in the castle town, within the domain territory, or
　　　　　with relatives, wherever you may be causes no concern at all. The matter of
　　　　　vacating residences may also be done at your convenience, taking your time. The above.
　　　　　　　End
　　　　　　　Note: The names of those granted leave are not recorded.
　　At the same meeting, the inspector conveyed the following:
　　　　1. Residential properties should be cleared at leisure and handed over at your convenience
　　　　1. Any perimeter fencing around properties should be left as is, and the main buildings are granted [to you]
　　　　1. Trees within the property grounds that have grown tall should be left in place

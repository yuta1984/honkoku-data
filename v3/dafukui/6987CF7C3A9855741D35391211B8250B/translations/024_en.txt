　　　　　　　Matters to be announced to the retainers

Therefore, this matter has been reported to His Lordship, and after deliberation, it has been decided at the Council Chamber that custody shall be granted to the family members as stated in the separate written document. Henceforth, any who commit wrongdoing shall be considered equivalent to rebels, so this should be understood accordingly.

　1. As previously announced, regarding the submission of former pledges and the disturbance - there were reasons for this, and there was no misconduct. Not honoring the collective pledges is equivalent to rebellion against father and son. From now on, all retainers without exception must maintain harmony and serve faithfully. Those who violate these instructions shall be subject to punishment, so this message must be conveyed in detail. The above.

　1. Regarding Nagami Ōkura: In this recent matter concerning Oguri Mimasaka, Ogita Shuma and all the others should have remained calm, but they did not do so.

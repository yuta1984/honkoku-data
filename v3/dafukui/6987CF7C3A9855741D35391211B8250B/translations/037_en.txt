1. On the 12th day of the 11th month, the hawks bestowed upon us during the summer leave arrived in Fukui together with the hawks bestowed upon Lord Masachika. In connection with this, Nagasaki Heiemon was dispatched as far as Akasaka. When the hawks arrived at the castle, Nishio Denbei (Masatora) and Kaifu Kanosuke (Motoyoshi) came out to meet them as far as the outer side of Kawara Gate Bridge. At the entrance hall's white sand court (shirasu), in the presence of the presenter of petitions (sōshaban), pages' chief, town magistrate, magistrate, and inspector (yokome), and with the chief retainers including Honda Magotarō (Nagakazu) at the entrance hall, the ceremony of receiving the hawks was conducted in the gun room (teppō-no-ma) in the presence of Lord Masachika.

1. On the 26th day of the same month, regarding Nakane Chōzaemon, a retainer of Lord Echizen-no-kami (Mitsunaga) who had been placed under our custody, arrangements were made for his transfer from the Edo mansion to the home domain. Senior ashigaru commander Iikawa Hikobei (Masatoshi) leading ten men from his unit, along with ōban guards Ogawa Tōemon (Sadatoki) and Mizuno Genshichi (Sadatomo), plus one ashigaru inspector and two ashigaru as escorts, provided security for Chōzaemon and arrived in Fukui today. Accordingly, he was housed at Hiratsuka Sangōemon's upper residence, and inspectors Hiraoka Sagōemon, Kawagoe Uemon, Niwa Hachizaemon, Hatta Kinemon (Tomoaki), and Akita Rokurōemon (Katsunori) went to that residence to inform Chōzaemon of the shogunate's orders and his lordship's intentions.

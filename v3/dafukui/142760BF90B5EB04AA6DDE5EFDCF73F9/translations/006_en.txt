we humbly request that you graciously order
our domain to be renamed as Maruyama Domain. If you would kindly
approve this request,
the name and reality would be in harmony, and naturally the boundaries between the jurisdictions of both domains would become
clear, ensuring that no inconveniences will
arise in the future, for which we would be most grateful. We humbly request that you continue to
grant your gracious permission and approval,
and earnestly petition you for this favor. With utmost respect and humble words.

February 28th    Governor of Tsuruga Domain

To the Honorable Controllers

Shingozaemon (Naomi) appeared and was given the following written instructions regarding gift exchanges and marriage matters.

Memorandum
1. Regarding the ceremonial rules for gift exchanges and marriage ceremonies, as well as entertainment, frugality should be observed in all matters, as has been repeatedly ordered from before. The aforementioned principles must be strictly observed, and furthermore, the following articles newly ordered should be understood:

1. Women's clothing has appeared increasingly luxurious in recent years. Henceforth, even the wives and children of daimyo must not use light gold thread embroidery or create excessively luxurious garments. Especially for female servants, distinctions between upper and lower classes must be strictly maintained. Fixed prices have been announced to the townspeople, so this principle should be understood.

1. Regarding new lacquerware: Even for the furnishings of province-holding daimyo, they should not exceed light nashiji maki-e (pear-ground lacquerware with gold dust decoration). For women's palanquins, document boxes, long chests and similar items, no decoration more elaborate than black lacquer with maki-e family crests should be used. For other people, black lacquer with light maki-e or itsu-kake should be used; palanquins should be black lacquer with metal fittings or velvet color; document boxes and long chests should use black lacquer or tame-nuri (amber-colored lacquer). Maki-e family crests are forbidden.

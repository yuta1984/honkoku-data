up to the lowest ranks shall receive one-third exemption
　　　Addendum:
　　　　For those who go to Edo around the third month, if there are those who are naturally
　　　　returned by mid-May of that year, the tribute for that year shall be
　　　　the same as for those returning from Edo duty. If they are returned
　　　　after June, the rice loan for that year shall be paid as tribute
　　　　at the same rate as those stationed in Edo. Even if regular stationed personnel are returned to the domain,
　　　　those who return after June shall pay the rice loan for that year as tribute
　　　　at the same rate as Edo duty. This principle shall apply down to the lowest ranks.
1. Those who go to Edo on autumn rotation duty shall also follow the same rules as spring rotation: for both the previous year and the year
　　of crossing over, they shall submit tribute at the 2 bu rate as stipulated for Edo duty.
　　In the year of return, even if they return at year's end, they shall pay tribute
　　at the same rate as those returning from Edo duty.
　　　Addendum:
　　　　If there are those who go around August, the tribute for that year
　　　　shall be submitted at the same rate as those returning from Edo duty. If they are returned after
　　　　the eleventh month, the rice loan for that year shall be paid as tribute
　　　　at the same rate as those stationed in Edo.
1. Those who go to Edo as late as October shall, for both that year and the year of return,
　　submit tribute at the 2 bu rate as stipulated for Edo duty.

"Record of Death by Illness of Former Christian Lineage
A retainer of Matsudaira Senjirō in Fukui castle town, Ashiwa District, Echizen Province - Tashiro Yōgen, eldest son of Tashiro Yōzan (a converted Christian), grandson of converted Christian Tashiro Yōsen, and himself also a former Christian, died of illness on February 27th of this Dragon year at the age of 82. His family temple is the Zen sect temple Taiseiin in the aforementioned castle town, where arrangements have been made.

As reported above, one person of this lineage has died of illness. Since Senjirō is of young age, we report this on his behalf. End."

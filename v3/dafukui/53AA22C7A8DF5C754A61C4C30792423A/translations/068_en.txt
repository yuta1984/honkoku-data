1st, On the 21st of the same month,
Lord Masachika, Lord Tsunamasa, and Lord Kozuke-no-suke Chikahide went to the castle together. In the White Reception Hall, with the senior councilors in attendance, [the shogun announced that] since Hyobu-taiyu (Masachika) was aware [of his condition] and had earnestly petitioned, his request was granted. Although [Tsunamasa] was still young, since [Masachika] was also ill, as requested, [Tsunamasa] was appointed and the succession was announced to Echizen-no-kami (Tsunamasa) without question. However, since it was a large domain and Echizen-no-kami was young, [the shogun] should give guidance without hesitation regarding domain administration and all other matters. This shogunal intention was conveyed by Great Elder Sakai Gaku-no-kami Tadakiyo.
Lord Masachika's response was: "I am deeply grateful for this repeated kind consideration from His Lordship. Although I am an incompetent person, I have hereditary senior retainers and retainers, so I will consult on all matters and, with [the shogun's] authority, ensure the domain remains peaceful by properly implementing administration so that Echizen-no-kami may serve loyally." After stating this, the audience concluded and they withdrew.

1st, On the 22nd of the same month, from the formal quarters,
Lord Tsunamasa moved to his [new] chambers, and Lady Man also moved together with him.

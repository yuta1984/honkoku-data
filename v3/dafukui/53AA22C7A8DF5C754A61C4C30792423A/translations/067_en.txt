were presented. To Her Ladyship, one box of mackerel (fifty fish inserted) and one load of small barrels were offered.

1st, July 8th, through the imperial messenger Miyoshi Bizen-no-kami Katsutsuka, twenty larks from the shogun's falconry were graciously received.
When Bizen-no-kami came to this mansion, at the entrance hall, Hanagi Geki Toki received the larks and brought them to the reception room. At that time, he went out to greet him as far as the wooden veranda of the great hall, and guided Bizen-no-kami to the reception room. The shogun's intentions were conveyed, and after the reception was completed, he sat directly for a long time, and there was a sake ceremony with the gifted larks made into soup. Since he declined the meal, it was not served. Upon his departure, he was seen off to the entrance hall.
As thanks for this, due to [Lord Masachika's] indisposition, Lord Tsunamasa went to the castle as his proxy and then made courtesy calls to the senior councilors.

1st, On the 18th of the same month, Lord Kozuke-no-suke Chikahide went to the castle (as announced yesterday, the 17th, through an official notice from Senior Councilor Tsuchiya Tajima-no-kami), where it was announced that Asukai Dainagon Masaaki's granddaughter (Lady Kiyo) would become Lord Masachika's adopted daughter (actually his niece) and be betrothed to Lord Tsunamasa, as Lord Masachika had previously requested. This was conveyed by Senior Councilor Tsuchiya Tajima-no-kami Nao. Upon leaving the castle, Lord Kozuke-no-suke came to this mansion and reported this matter. As thanks for this, Senior Retainer Iida Shukome Yasunari was sent as messenger to the senior councilors, junior councilors, and Lord Sakai Kawachi-no-kami Tada.
However, due to Lord Masachika's indisposition, Lord Kozuke-no-suke was summoned.

I am at a complete loss. Just as I returned home from going out, I received a letter from Mino-no-kami-dono. This is truly most absurd. He tells me to accompany him tomorrow morning, but I cannot calculate how I should greet you. Whatever I might say, since there is no agreement, there is no longer any need to speak of it. The matter I conveyed to Mino-no-kami-dono the day before yesterday has all come to seem like my falsehood, but if he says that aspect is not troubling, then I too find it not troubling. I believe it would be too much not to acknowledge both letters, which is why I write thus. That the reply is favorable is indeed a remarkable thing.

Please kindly arrange the above matter as appropriate. With fear and respect, humbly stated.

I understand. I am most grateful for your frequent visits and kind letters. Beyond this, I humbly request that things proceed favorably. The above.

Postscript: Regarding the matter of court rank, whatever is decreed - whether becoming Dainagon or whatever may come to pass - I have no reservations at all. However, the more I appear and handle various matters, the more I believe our house's prestige will diminish, so I wish to withdraw as quickly as possible and have my heir serve in my place. After expressing gratitude to the imperial messenger and presenting both Their Lordships for an audience, I believe it would be a good time, which is why I communicate this to you. The above.

On the same day, regarding the same matter, the following reply letter came from Abe Shirōgorō Masayuki-dono to Chief Retainer Minagawa Tazaemon Katsumoto:
　　Furthermore, I cannot bear to say anything more, so I shall not speak of it. With things being this way, there should have been some consultation since this summer.
I understand that what was sent to Hachibe's place has been reviewed.
　　I find this particularly regrettable. The above.
In any case, regarding your coming out to serve, I cannot say in any way that this should not happen. Beyond this, you said to consult with Ōsumi and proceed appropriately - what would be best to do? In my humble heart

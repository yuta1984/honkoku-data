Item: Regarding my being appointed to the excellent position of Echizen-no-kami's successor, I am most grateful for His Lordship's kind consideration. At this moment, though it may be presumptuous to mention, I humbly request that Senkiku, the heir of Nakatsukasa, be made my adopted son. I earnestly request that all of you intercede so that this wish may be granted as requested.

Item: Regarding Gonzō, who has been entrusted to Tajima-no-kami and is experiencing hardship, I find this particularly troubling. However, since Echizen-no-kami during his lifetime had conveyed instructions and made this known to his retainers, it would be difficult for me to meet with him now. Nevertheless, now that I have been appointed to succeed the house, I wish to provide assistance to Gonzō and handle various matters with ease. Therefore, I request that you intercede with Tajima-no-kami so that he may understand and agree to this arrangement. Although I could send a messenger from my side to convey this, if there should be any difficulty in receiving a response, I would like Yamato-no-kami to consult and provide appropriate guidance.

Item: Regarding Gonzō's audience with the Shogun, I understand this is Tajima-no-kami's petition. If it would be appropriate for me to add my voice to your collective agreement, I hope you will discuss this matter favorably. Should Tajima-no-kami not agree to these two matters despite your intercession, I would like to petition even if it means seeking private consultation with the Council of Elders. These are my thoughts written as an oral statement.

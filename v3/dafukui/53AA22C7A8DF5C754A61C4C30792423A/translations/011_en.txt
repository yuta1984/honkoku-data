were presented.

Senkiku sama attended the castle and presented a ceremonial sword, gold horse substitute, and twenty sets of court dress, offering congratulations for the adoption.

However, as Masachika sama could not accompany due to illness, assistance in palace matters was requested from Watanabe Ōsumi-no-kami (Tsunasada) dono.

1. On the same day, through a messenger, three first cod of the domain's produce were presented following the precedent of previous generations.

1. On July 19th, through the envoy Inaba Seizaemon (Masasada) dono, thirty larks caught by hawks were received as a gift. When Seizaemon dono came to this residence, the larks were received at the entrance by the caretaker Tomioka Matasaburō (as both chief retainers were away on messenger duties at this time, Matasaburō received them) and brought to the audience hall. At that time, as Masachika sama was ill, Senkiku sama served as his representative, greeting and guiding the visitor to the waiting room next to the crossing room, then escorting Seizaemon dono to the audience hall where the shogun's message was conveyed (at this time, a kind message was also conveyed that since his complexion was poor, he should take his time to recover). After the acknowledgment was completed, there was a sake ceremony with the gifted larks prepared as soup. The formal meal was declined and not served. Upon departure, he was escorted to the entrance. As thanks for this, Senkiku sama attended the castle and dispatched messengers: Minagawa Tazaemon to the senior councilors, chief retainers to the junior councilors and Sakai Kawachi-no-kami (Tadataka) dono, and military commanders to the ceremonial attendants and other Fuyō-no-ma officials, as well as messengers and audience hall guards.

1. On the same day, a formal letter of thanks was sent to Senior Councilor Tsuchiya regarding the presentation of the domain's first cod produce.

Regarding my domain, I have been repeatedly sent envoys, and if I do not express proper gratitude for this, it would be discourteous toward my superiors. Because this was pointed out to me, I suppressed my feelings and went out to fulfill my duties up to the senior councilors' invitation. Beyond this, I wish to make a petition of utmost importance. I humbly request that you handle this appropriately through consultation with Ōsumi-dono. Though there are things I would like to say when instructions are given, as it has been a long time, I have conveyed my remaining concerns to the senior councilors. I have also mentioned this matter to you. In any case, the more I go out and perform my duties, the worse things become, so I would like to withdraw as soon as possible and have Senkiku take over my duties. If it would be appropriate to consult with Ōsumi-dono, I earnestly hope that you will visit tomorrow accompanied by him.

I have prepared this letter wishing to send it before your departure tomorrow morning. Above.
The 25th

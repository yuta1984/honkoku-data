1. In the 4th month (date unspecified), due to crop failure throughout the domain last year, a request was made to suspend the storage of tax rice from Katsuyama territory for the relief of the people. The following petition was conveyed by Senior Retainers Koma Mokuzaemon Teisumi and Inaba Uneme Harufusa to Lord Watanabe Osumi-no-kami Tsunasada:

Last year (Year of the Tiger), the domain experienced an unexpected crop failure. After examining rice and miscellaneous grains throughout the countryside and towns, and considering this year's barley crop as well as the domain's accumulated stores, we find that supplies cannot be sustained through summer into autumn. Consequently, rice prices have risen sharply, causing hardship for the common people. Therefore, we have standardized prices throughout the domain at 25 monme and 6 bu of silver per 4 to 5 shō bag (Kyō measure), releasing stored rice for retail sale in various locations. However, due to rice shortages, this cannot be continued. We have attempted to procure rice from other domains but without success. We have ordered that somehow supplies must last until the current year's harvest time. Given these circumstances, we expect there will be many who will starve to death. Therefore, we wish to suspend the storage of tax rice from Katsuyama for the Tiger year and request your consultation on this matter.

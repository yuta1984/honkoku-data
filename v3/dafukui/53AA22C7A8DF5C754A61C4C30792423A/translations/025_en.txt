If you do not do so, it will not accord with Echizen-no-kami-dono's wishes, and moreover the domain will not be settled—I have understood this reasoning. I believe it is quite reasonable that you think it would be good for Senkiku-dono's sake. However, I believe it would be best if you absolutely come to the castle tomorrow or the day after and perform your New Year's duties. If you do not advance in court rank during your generation, there will be no opportunity for Senkiku-dono to receive court rank either. Moreover, this year there has been no discussion of court ranks for Hitachi-no-suke-dono, Matsudaira Daishichi-dono, or Senkiku-dono. Should you not come to the castle, there might be thoughts of appointing a proxy. In such a case, I believe it would be difficult to proceed. Please forgive me for this presumptuous advice. My inadequacy is beyond help, but since I believe this is for the sake of your generations, please discard any wrongdoing and forgive me. With fear and respect, humbly stated.

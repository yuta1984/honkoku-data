A messenger, the caretaker Ōtani Ichiuemon Jian, was sent to the Nishimaru rōjū (senior councilor) Andō Tsushima-no-kami Nobuyoshi to inquire about the health of the Dainagon-sama.
Note: Since messengers were sent daily until the 11th, these are not recorded.

1. On the same day, for the same reason as above, the caretaker Ōtani Ichiuemon Jian went to see the duty officer Matsudaira Sakon-no-shōgen Noriyuki to inquire about prayers. When told that if there were precedents, a written document should be submitted, he attached the example from Hōei 5 (1708), year of the rat, when Bunshōin-sama had measles, and submitted the following petition:

　　　　　For the safe recovery of Dainagon-sama from smallpox, we wish to
　　　　　conduct prayers at Sannō. We humbly request permission for this. Above.
　　　　　　March 3rd　　　　　Matsudaira Hyōbu-dayū

However, although this document was submitted, later instructions via an attached note indicated that such measures were unnecessary.

1. On March 6th, for the same reason as above, to inquire about his health, all retainers went to Nishimaru castle to pay respects, and when inquiring about his condition, senior councilor Andō Tsushima-no-kami Noriyuki made an announcement.

1. On the 9th of the same month, there was a summons from duty officer Matsudaira Sakon-no-shōgen Noriyuki, and caretaker Miyanishi Jūrōzaemon Sadayoshi went to attend. He was informed that since the Shōgun was making a pilgrimage to Nikkō shrine, prayers for his safety would be conducted at Ryōun-in in Ueno.

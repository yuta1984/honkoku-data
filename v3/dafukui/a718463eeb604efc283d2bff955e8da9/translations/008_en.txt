Memorandum
One: Regarding financial difficulties, the directive issued this time states that for the next five years, matters shall proceed as described above. Given this situation, His Lordship has also ordered special economies to be implemented. Therefore, all members of the household must diligently observe the directives regarding frugality that have been issued by successive generations. For official business, no restrictions shall be imposed, and maximum economy should be practiced as ordered. For private matters, each person should bear this in mind. Should there be any among the people who show poor judgment in the future, thorough investigation shall be conducted, and cases of poor judgment shall be reported to the senior retainers as has been ordered, so this point

should be understood.
One: Regarding hospitality when people gather together, this matter has been frequently addressed by previous lords, but as it has been ordered again this time, public occasions must not exceed one soup, one dish, pickles, and return cups of sake. However, when close relatives and family members gather regularly, it may be difficult to adhere strictly to the above regulations, so serving two kinds of available items as accompaniments to sake beyond the prescribed hospitality is acceptable. For everything else, even if available items or vegetables such as greens and onions are at hand, their use should be strictly avoided. The same prudent approach should be taken regarding sake.

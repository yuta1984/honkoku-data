1. On the 21st day of the first month, the 17th memorial service for Lord Bairinmei was held at Tenryuji Temple in Shinagawa. The same service was also held at Tenryuji Temple in Matsuoka.

1. On the same day, at the Council Chamber (hyōjōsho), regarding the matter of rice loans for the retainers, the monthly duty senior retainer Koma Ise (Sumitaka) issued the following written instructions to all monthly duty officials. Subsequently, the magistrates and inspectors communicated the matters of allocation methods and frugality measures to all departments.

　　　　His lordship's intention is as follows: In recent years, due to financial difficulties in the domain's finances, the retainers have been repeatedly asked to contribute voluntary donations (shinji), and consequently all are suffering from financial hardship, which his lordship has heard and is concerned about. Therefore, his lordship wishes to forgive these voluntary contributions. However, in recent years expenses have continued to mount, and

　　　　the domain's finances are in extreme difficulty, so this measure is also difficult to implement. Therefore, from among everyone's stipends, the accumulated voluntary rice contributions currently being requested shall be offered according to rice yield (kokudaka). Accordingly, among the retainers, those with land grants (chigyō-dori) and above shall contribute according to rice yield, while those receiving rice stipends (kirimai) and below shall contribute according to the number of rice bales, with all contributing without exception down to the lowest ranks. Within this system, some relief shall be provided through the aforementioned allocation method. Furthermore, the simple ceremonial practices proclaimed by successive lords shall be followed with utmost frugality. Moreover, this arrangement is fixed for a period of five years from this year, so both the upper ranks and lower classes shall contribute as described above.

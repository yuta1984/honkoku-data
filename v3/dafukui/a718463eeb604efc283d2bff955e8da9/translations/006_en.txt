Regarding the transfer procedures, these shall be handed over to the deputy officials (daikan) during the seventh month of this year, and from the summer crops onward, storage in the official granaries shall take place. However, even if there remain unpaid portions (mishin), after the seventh month, collection shall be conducted through direct negotiations with farmers, and the deputy officials shall not handle any special arrangements.

However, regarding local collection portions to be submitted according to fief assessments (chigyōdaka), there may be arrangements that could benefit individual circumstances. For portions under the Akesato granary deputy officials as well, following the same principle, there shall be a uniform exemption (goyōsha) of five rin per unit from last year's winter submission amounts. However, for rice bran, straw, snow fence fees, and similar items, collection shall be made according to remaining balances.

Memorandum
Regarding those who have been traveling to Edo and have received increased borrowings (zō-haishaku) due to insufficient preparation funds, many items have been requested gradually, making it difficult due to the burden of multiple submissions. After this examination, the increased borrowing portions for Edo travel shall be forgiven. Hereafter, even if applications for increased borrowings are submitted, they shall not be approved. However, if extremely difficult circumstances arise depending on the nature of residential duties, after detailed examination and through official consideration, even small amounts may be lent at an interest rate of one and a half bu per month.

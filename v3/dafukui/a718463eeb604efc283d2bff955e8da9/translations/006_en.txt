Regarding the transfer matters: these shall be handed over to the district magistrate (daikan) during the current seventh month, and stored in the granary from the summer harvest. Even if there are remaining unpaid taxes (mishin), after the seventh month, collection through direct negotiation between peasants is a separate matter, and the magistrate shall not handle such cases.

However, regarding local administrative portions to be submitted according to stipend amounts, this arrangement should benefit each individual's circumstances. For portions from Akesato granary distribution and those attached to magistrates, following the same principle as above, five rin per unit from the tribute rate paid last winter shall be uniformly exempted. Rice bran, straw, snow fence fees and similar items shall be collected according to remaining amounts.

Memorandum

One: For those traveling to Edo who have received increased loans due to insufficient funds for preparations, as the variety of requested items has increased and multiple tribute payments have caused hardship, after this examination, the increased loan portions for Edo travel shall be forgiven. Henceforth, even if applications for increased loans are submitted, they shall not be approved. However, if extreme hardship can be demonstrated due to specific circumstances of residence requirements, after detailed examination and through official discretion, small amounts may be loaned at one and a half bu per month.

March 10th: Regarding the handling of foreign ships when they arrive, concerning the matter 
previously ordered to retainer Sakai Genba Tomofusa during last year's return journey to 
inquire about handling methods in the western provinces, a written inquiry from Ōseki 
Shingozaemon Naomi, the Edo caretaker, was circulated earlier. Today at the council chamber, 
monthly duty elder Koma Ise Sumitaka distributed the following written directive, 
one copy each to the Kanazu magistrate, district magistrate, and inspector:

　　　　Memorandum
　　When foreign ships pass through the waters of Fukui domain territory, for example 
　　three ri or about five ri offshore from land, heading north or south

　　Even if they appear to be foreign ships, there is no need to report 
　　to Edo. However, in such cases, the coastal villages should be instructed 
　　not to discuss the passage of foreign ships
1. If a foreign ship appears to have dropped anchor and is staying,
　　immediately alert all adjacent coastal areas of the domain territory, dispatch guard boats,
　　and during daytime have many local people and those from adjacent coastal areas 
　　come out to the beaches. When night falls, light warning fires on land to show strict vigilance
　　and prevent them from landing. This is of primary importance.
　　Dropping anchor in northern province harbors is for commercial goods

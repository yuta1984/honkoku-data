Therefore, pure silver was ordered to be produced through cupellation, but given the current output from various mines in recent years, this would be difficult to achieve even in over twenty years. Accordingly, like the circulation of gold, silver recoining based on actual weight has been ordered for the future, and the matter of circulation according to specified amounts has also been declared as follows:

　In addition, even if transactions were conducted saying "how many pieces, how many kan-me" in circulating silver, from the 11th month of this year of the Dog, transactions shall be conducted saying "how many pieces, how many kan-me" in new silver. While circulating silver remains in use, using the method of exchanging circulating silver in place of new silver is a matter of personal discretion.

1. The exchange of kan-character gold shall be limited to five years from this year of the Dog until the coming year of the Tiger. The exchange of Genroku gold shall be limited to the coming year of the Boar.

　　Method of exchanging new gold and silver
　The matter of exchanging kan-character gold and Genroku gold with new gold remains the same as before, without change.

　　Regarding Keichō old silver and new silver, per 10 kan-me
　Genroku silver has a 25% increase

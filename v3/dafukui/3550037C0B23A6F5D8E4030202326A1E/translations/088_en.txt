Intercalary October
1. Intercalary October 28th: There was a summons from Goyōban Kuze Yamato-no-kami Shigeyuki, and when Goryūsui Ōseki Shingozaemon Naotaka went to attend, he was given the following written notice regarding the matter of gold and silver currency circulation:

　　　　　Memorandum that new gold and silver shall be put into circulation from the 11th month of this year of the Dog
　　1. Regarding the recoining of gold that was ordered, due to gradual progress, as previously announced, the circulation of kan-character gold will cease at the end of the coming year of the Boar. Accordingly, henceforth when determining prices through mutual agreement for various goods shall be exceptional, but for tribute payments, granted money, stipends, loans, outstanding payments, etc., all shall circulate according to the amounts that have been established since long ago, as declared below:

　　　　In addition, even if transactions were conducted saying "how many ryō" in kan-character gold, from the 11th month of this year of the Dog, transactions shall be conducted saying "how many ryō" in new gold. Of course, while kan-character gold remains in circulation, using the method of exchanging kan-character gold in place of new gold is a matter of personal discretion.

　　1. Gold has been recoined to its actual weight and does not require pure gold, hence it has been completed as described above, but silver has many instances of insufficient purity.

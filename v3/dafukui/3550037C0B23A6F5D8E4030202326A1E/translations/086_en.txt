1. Same day: There was a summons from Goyōban Mizuno Izumi-no-kami Tadayuki, and when Goryūsui Miyakita Jūrōzaemon Sadayoshi went to attend, he was given the following written directive:
　　As has been ordered repeatedly before, in case of fire, personnel should be dispatched within two to three blocks around the residence to extinguish it while it is still a small fire. This applies not only to the main residence but also to middle and lower residences - those who have stationed retainers should send out their retainers. Of course, those with small numbers of personnel need not worry about this, but they should be strictly ordered in advance to rush to the scene as quickly as possible. When dispatching personnel, they should report to the inspectors (metsuke) or mounted guards (tsukaiban) at that location. Should there be any delay in dispatching personnel to nearby fires, the details will be reported to and received by the inspectors. The above.

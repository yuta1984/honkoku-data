1. Intercalary October 13th: Regarding the desire to receive a grant of a residence, a petition was submitted through messenger Goryūsui Ōseki Shingozaemon Naotaka to Goyōban Kuze Yamato-no-kami Shigeyuki as follows:

　The granted lower residence of 22,500 tsubo at Honjo Tatekawa-dōri was recently requisitioned for official use. At that time, since there were multiple residences, it was declared through written notice that no replacement land would be granted, and I have understood and accepted this. Regarding this matter, within the Honjo Sunamura Shinden area, there is 20,000 tsubo of held land that has been tax-free since ancient times. It is waterlogged land where enclosed construction has been impossible since long ago.

　Particularly after the earthquake of previous years, it became connected to the sea, and now there is no way to establish boundaries. Given these circumstances, though it is not land that would be useful for official purposes, since it is near the hawking grounds, I wish to offer up this held land. I have, besides my main residence, one granted residence at Reiganjima where I have stationed my mother and retainers. Other than this, I possess no other held residences. Therefore, I petition that another appropriate residential plot be granted somewhere. If this meets with your approval, I humbly request that appropriate internal consultations be made and granted. The above.

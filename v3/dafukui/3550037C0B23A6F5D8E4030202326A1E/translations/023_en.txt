1. On the same day, a circular notice came from the chief inspectors regarding the matter of firearm inspection, as follows:

　　　　　Memorandum

　　1. Regarding the matter of firearm inspection, henceforth in the Eight Kantō Provinces, one should understand the intent proclaimed in Jōkyō 4 and consult with the firearm inspection officials to receive instructions.
　　　　However, when wild boar, deer, and wolves appear in large numbers and damage fields, consultation is not necessary.
　　　　　In government lands, private domains, and temple/shrine territories alike, set monthly or daily limits for shooting with loaded firearms, and promptly report this to the firearm inspection officials. When
　　　　　shooting is finished, confiscate the firearms and also report this matter to the inspection officials.

　　1. Within a ten-ri radius of Edo, even if they are hunters, all firearms shall be confiscated without exception.
　　　　However, when wild boar, deer, and wolves appear in large numbers, damage fields, attack people and horses, and cause hardship to farmers, consult with the firearm inspection officials to receive instructions.

　　1. For provinces outside the Eight Kantō Provinces, submitting annual certificates and other documents to the firearm inspection officials will no longer be necessary. However, to ensure there is no negligence, strict orders shall be given to government lands, private domains, and temple/shrine territories alike.

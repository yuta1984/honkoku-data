One, regarding children or siblings who serve in official duty themselves and have built separate rooms, when there is a request to take them during a relocation of same-surname residences, that matter shall be reported to the senior retainers (karō) and handed over after receiving instructions. When separate rooms are involved, if there is a request to the estate magistrate, it shall be recorded in a memorandum.
　　However, whether retired persons or siblings, those without stipend cannot take rooms even if they have built them, as per regulations. Nevertheless, for those who are relatives of masterless samurai (rōnin) who have petitioned and built separate residences within the estate grounds, if there are written records with the estate magistrate from when those rooms were built, they may be taken after reporting to the senior retainers during estate relocation. Even if one serves in official duty themselves, if removing rooms built as extensions to the main house would damage the main house, or naturally if there are rooms within the main house, they shall not be transferred. The site where such rooms were removed must be properly repaired before handover.

One, regarding row houses (nagaya), floor coverings shall be transferred without leaving any behind. In addition, wooden floors, fixtures, stone slabs, stepping platforms, second-floor ladders, doors, sliding screens, ceilings, backing boards, etc., shall not be touched at all and left as they are. In general, eaves attached to row houses shall never be removed.

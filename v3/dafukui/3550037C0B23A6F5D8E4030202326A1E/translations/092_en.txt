Addendum: For cases where additional gold and silver were given separately due to the deteriorating quality of gold and silver since the 9th year of Genroku (year of the Rat), once the original amounts are paid in new gold and silver, the additional payments shall be discontinued

1. For items determined based on calculations for financial assistance and other expenses: amounts determined before the 9th year of Genroku (year of the Rat) shall remain the same even with new gold and silver. However, items determined since the year of the Rat shall be reduced by half

The above shall be strictly observed. For other matters, the intent of this document shall serve as precedent.
Moreover, since the change in exchange rates applies only to silver from the Hōei era onward, anyone who employs confusing methods regarding exchange rates or sale prices of new gold, silver, and copper coins shall certainly be subject to severe punishment after deliberation.

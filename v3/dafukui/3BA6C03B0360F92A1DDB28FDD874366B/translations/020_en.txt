Item: September 29th - Regarding the dispute between the three villages of Kitagata, Yoshizaki, and Hamasaka, after investigation by Kanazu magistrate Mizuno Zenzaemon (Katsumitsu), the following written directive was issued by the magistrate's office:

　　　　　　　　　　Memorandum
　　　　Item: The three bays of Yoshizaki, Hamasaka, and Kitagata have since ancient times submitted written records of the number of boats for lagoon fishing, and henceforth shall not increase the number of boats beyond what is recorded in the lagoon fishing boat submissions.

　　　　Item: Regarding the Buddhist mounds (bōzuka) from Yoshizaki Bay into the lagoon, since they are in the middle of the river and difficult to ascertain, while future repair and restoration of damaged mounds is acceptable, no new ones shall be constructed.

　　　　Item: When fishermen from Yoshizaki and Hamasaka enter the lagoon, they shall not enter for fishing with their boats from the eastern end of Kitakata Bay.

　　　　Item: The fishing activities of those from Kitakata shall continue as before, and no new ventures shall be undertaken henceforth.

　　　　Item: The fishermen of Kitagata shall not enter with their fishing boats from the boundaries of Hamasaka Bay and Yoshizaki Bay.
　　　　　　　Addendum:
　　　　　　　　Apart from the above, fishing may be conducted as before with the three bays intermixing.

　　Regarding these three bays, henceforth there shall be no disputes concerning fishing in the lagoon...

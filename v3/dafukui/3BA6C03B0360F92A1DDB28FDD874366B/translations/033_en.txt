Item: December (day unclear) Regarding the ceremonial spear, in connection with the change of name this time:
　Lord Yoshishina's ceremonial spear was changed to a moon sword spear with iris reed sheath for his use.
　The sickle-shaped spear had been held by generations,
　but by his will it was discontinued.
　　　However, regarding the sickle-shaped spear:
　　　　After Lord Daian'in and Lord Seijōin held it,
　　　　Lord Shōan'in and Lord Hōsen'in held it, but since generations had
　　　　short lives, Lady Yōju'in expressed her wish
　　　　that it should be changed, so according to her story, it was changed.

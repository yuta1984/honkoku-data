【Red ink notation】Kurisaki Incident
1. Bunsei 13, tiger year, 10th month, 15th day, what was decreed to the court physicians as follows　　Inspector
　　Since court physicians are fundamentally employed based on their hereditary profession, henceforth at succession, depending on their sons' professional competence, stipends and land grants shall be reduced for those who are inexperienced. Understanding this, they were ordered to devote themselves to their hereditary profession.
　The above matter should be conveyed to all court physicians.
　1. Regarding the above, a document given by the senior councilors for colleagues to understand confidentially was as follows:
　　　Palace physicians shall henceforth be appointed with a role stipend of 100 koku, and those receiving rice stipends and support allowances who are appointed as palace physicians, if they serve diligently, shall be granted 100 koku during their service.
　　　　However, "role stipend" is an internal decision.
　When the above was decreed, petition statements were submitted by palace physicians, but meanwhile on Tenpo 3, dragon year, 2nd month, 20th day, Kurisaki Ryoshuku, due to lack of dedication to medical practice, after investigation, was granted succession with 10-man stipend. The details are that Ryoshuku【red ink notation】—a fellow called Sanzo, a shaved-head man　while residing at his birth family, the Mashimo house, would go to training places or enjoyed killing, showing no dedication to medical practice. Given the previous decree, due to improper conduct, salary reduction was decreed. However, starting with palace physicians, all submitted the following petition　Draft of oral statement:
　1. As decreed last year, since court physicians are employed based on hereditary profession, at succession depending on their sons' professional competence, stipends and land grants would be reduced—we are all truly mortified by this, so from that time we submitted written petitions, but without any response, this time Kurisaki Dobaku's adoptive son during illness, Ryoshuku, due to lack of dedication to medical practice, was granted 10-man stipend. However, the Kurisaki house has been appointed to inner surgery for generations without any misconduct, serving faithfully
　　
　　traditionally. When Dobaku was critically ill, though there was a natural son who turned nine this year, according to regulations, since Ryoshuku was eighteen years old and we thought he would soon be useful for service, we set aside the natural son and made him an adoptive son during illness. However, he was granted succession like a minor, and the tradition of the Kurisaki house's diligent service leaves nothing behind—truly we find this most regrettable. Furthermore, not limited to the Kurisaki house, all court physicians have received the generous favor of successive lords, being treated with the same compassion as samurai without any ■, being granted merciful treatment, and especially being employed close to your side. Therefore, though we cannot serve in military duties when receiving such special gracious commands, we understand that we should never forget loyal service morning and evening to repay your generous favor. Please, with the same compassion as successive lords, at succession, if there is no misconduct in the parent, "whether adoptive or natural, if over fifteen years old, first grant succession without change, and then if dedication to hereditary profession is poor, decree more strictly than previous punishments—this would serve as guidance for everyone and we believe would result in even more faithful service." As we petitioned before, if salary reduction is decreed at succession, there is no way to understand how much the succession should be, so for immediate adoptive sons during illness and temporary adoptive sons when stationed in Edo, even if they have proper lineage, there will likely be no one in the retainer band who will negotiate favorably thereafter. When there are no suitable adoptive sons among colleagues, unavoidably we must secretly arrange with skilled medical practitioners from towns and countryside—though the lineage is improper, it becomes a situation of merely continuing the family name, losing the generational family line, and eventually becoming unable to tend to ancestors' graves. We all shed tears. Even if we currently serve diligently and receive various favors, if descendants' traditions do not remain and there is no reward for diligent service, naturally service to the lord becomes neglectful, which would be inexcusable, so regarding such feelings...

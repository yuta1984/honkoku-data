Promotions and transfers of minor officials and below

Article 1: Regulations for promotion from minor official status issued on the 5th day of the 10th month of Genbun 1 (1736) are as follows:
　Regarding those of minor official status, they have petitioned for advancement and received various promotions after examination, but in recent years there are some who have served without adequate service periods and show no evidence of having performed distinguished duties. Moreover, since there are guard units among those of the same rank, it is questionable that those without sufficient years of service are being appointed to such positions. From ancient times, those of the same rank with sufficient years of service were admitted to guard units, but even for those with recent years of service who show no distinguished service, petitions to be admitted to guard units based on precedent will not be accepted. This matter should be thoroughly examined and communicated by the respective supervisors going forward.

Article 1: Regarding Kanazu minor accountants: Nakamura Yasudayu has been a minor accountant from the beginning. Takemura Denemon was initially a clerk and later became a minor accountant. Minor accountant Yamada Shinbei was appointed as an additional Kanazu clerk in the 6th year of Meiwa (1769). In his place, Kawai Denemon was directly appointed from clerk to minor accountant and dispatched.

Article 1: Kobayashi Enemon, clerk to Kawai Sadaemon who serves as district magistrate of the entrusted territory, became a minor accountant on the 16th day of the 12th month of Meiwa 6 (1769), with an increase of 2 koku and 1 stipend, and directly assumed that role.

Article 1: When retainers of samurai rank and below in the entrusted territory receive salary increases and other favorable status appointments, this shall be communicated to the magistrate by separate document.
　This shall not be communicated to the chief administrator of the entrusted territory.

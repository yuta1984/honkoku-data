The precedent from the osuke-beya (secretariat) is as follows:

Record of those who should express gratitude
1. Those of teiza-bangai rank and above  1. Officials  1. Close attendants
1. All junior pages  1. Inner court physicians  1. Tea ceremony masters

Record of relatives and connections who should express gratitude
1. Same surname, father and son, brothers
   The above mutually express gratitude
1. Son-in-law and father-in-law
   The above mutually express gratitude
   However, when sisters are given in marriage in place of brothers, gratitude is expressed as with son-in-law and father-in-law
   1. When a daughter is given in marriage during the parent's generation and the parent is succeeded, there is no mutual gratitude
   1. Even when marriage is not completed, if the petition is approved, son-in-law and father-in-law express gratitude
   1. When aunts, nieces, etc. are given in marriage, there is no gratitude
1. Grandfather and grandson, uncle and nephew
   The above mutually express gratitude
   However, when adopted into another house, since there is no mourning taboo for grandsons and nephews, grandfathers and uncles do not express gratitude, but grandsons and nephews do express gratitude
1. Cousins have no gratitude regardless of mourning taboos
1. When both father and the person himself are adopted, there is no gratitude from all relatives on the adoptive father's side
   Total
1. For minor officials and below, including stipend recipients, matters of temporary assignments or duties are communicated to their supervisors
1. When minor officials and foot soldiers are promoted and appointed as guards, the karō communicate directly to them. At this time, their previous supervisors are also included
1. When transferring from foot soldiers to anywhere else, it should be communicated to the supervisor of the destination. There is no need to inform the foot soldier commander; the supervisor should communicate it

1. On the first day of the second month of Kansei 1, year of the Rooster, the following was decided:
   1. Members of guard units summoned for official duties on ceremonial days should attend wearing hemp kamishimo as formal dress
   However, this concerns role changes in the karō's official room. There is a precedent of attending in hemp kamishimo on the 28th day of the 5th month of the year of the Monkey
1. On the 17th day of the 5th month of Meiwa 3, year of the Dog, those receiving official duties during role appointments before the lord had been attending wearing only hakama, but henceforth it was newly decreed that they should attend wearing hemp kamishimo. Therefore, when karō appear before the lord, they wear tsugi-kataginu. The same applies to chūrō. Also, for role changes announced in the karō's room, as before, those receiving appointments wear only hakama, and later when appearing before the lord to express gratitude, they should attend wearing hemp kamishimo
1. Until the reign of Shōan-in-sama, when appointments of mono-gashira and above were made, the karō would announce them, and afterwards they would appear before the lord to express gratitude. However, from the 2nd day of the 9th month of Kyōhō 7, year of the Tiger, when Hōsen-in-sama entered the domain, and on the 13th when Kumagai Kohyōe was appointed御持弓頭, and from when other role changes were announced, mono-gashira and above came to be appointed directly by the lord, and this continues today. From this time, the karō all attend before the lord to conduct business and express gratitude. Further reference should be made to the section on role appointments.

Article 1: On the 22nd day of the 6th month of An'ei 7 (1778), by the lord's will, the district magistrate position was appointed as equal to officials next to the banner magistrate. On the 15th day of the 1st month of the 10th year (1781), basic salary for three district magistrates was granted.

Article 1: In Bunsei 11 (1824), year of the rat, Ōi Chōjūrō was appointed as district magistrate of the lord's territory to succeed Hasebe Koemon as head supervisor of the lord's territory. His seating remained as before. The aforementioned Chōjūrō had long served as district magistrate of the lord's territory and was appointed to the position next to the palace steward with long hakama rank. He was appointed as head supervisor while maintaining that seat. However, Chōjūrō privately conveyed to his colleagues that while the honor of his status was beyond question, the territorial administration role was an official position facing the government, and subordinates understood the head supervisor position as distinctly different from district magistrate. When he was previously appointed to long hakama rank as district magistrate, even subordinates lamented that such seating was unusual for district magistrates. Regarding territorial administration roles, in ancient times there was special treatment, but since Lord Ryūtoku's reign when territorial administration was again proclaimed, from Kumagai Kohyōe through former official Hasebe Koemon, appointments were made to magistrate rank seating or next to magistrate seating. However, if he were appointed while maintaining his current seat, subordinates would think the situation different from before, which would be inappropriate. He requested to be appointed in the same manner as former official Koemon, and in the following year of the ox, he was appointed to magistrate rank seating.

Article 1: On the 8th day of the 4th month of Kansei 11 (1799), gunpowder magistrate Kurihara Hikoemon inquired about his seating relative to colleague Katsuki Magozaemon, asking whether he should be seated next to Magozaemon. After respective consultations, he was advised to understand it as next seating. However, even for returning officials, when seating is not specifically appointed, it should be new official seating.
However, the circumstances are as follows:
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Kurihara Hikoemon
Hōreki 14 (1764), year of the monkey - katoku; An'ei 3 (1774), year of the horse - guard reform; An'ei 8 (1779), 9th month - gunpowder magistrate

Regarding my son's attendance seating, it is not yet known, but I heard that he might be appointed to appear above the children of assembly members. In that case, he would perform ceremonies next to the children of chamberlains. This would be different from when I served in office, causing confusion.

There have been requests from some time ago, and while it may be inappropriate to mention this again, it is urgent so I speak of it. I request your consideration for a favorable arrangement. While regular attendance is not necessarily formal protocol, I am confused by the clear changes, so I make this request.

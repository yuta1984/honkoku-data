Record of Senior Retainers
One: Genroku 5, Year of the Monkey, 7th month, 5th day - Son of Kitchen Head Kusaemon
　　　Granted 12 koku of rice stipend and support for 3 persons - Yoshida Tōsuke
　　　Note: His father Kusaemon's rice stipend was 18 koku and support for 3 persons
　The aforementioned father Kusaemon died of illness this summer, so the son was granted the above provisional appointment and summoned. For now, he should be assigned to perform duties such as accounting work, as instructed by Matsudaira Shōbei and Sakai Yosaburō. Today this was conveyed to magistrate Kanie Gyōbu Uemon to relay to Tōsuke. However, while Edo has indicated this should be granted as succession, unless there are special intentions, there is no precedent for granting succession to minor officials. Therefore, I instructed Kanie Gyōbu Uemon to investigate further. He reported that generally, if it is succession, stipends are granted from the time of the parent's death, but if not succession, stipends are granted from the day of appointment according to law. In recent years, when provisional appointments were granted to the son of Master Carpenter Takama Yoichirō and the son of Barren Land Head Kubomura Yaemon, though not designated as succession, stipends were granted continuously like succession. Today I instructed to proceed with the appointment for now and reported this matter to Edo【End of red ink notation】

　　　　Regarding Succession of Assistant Officials and Minor Officials
One: In Kanbun 11, Year of the Boar, 10th month, the following was proclaimed and conveyed to magistrates through Honda Sakon:
【In small text】Officials who serve their roles well, when they die leaving sons, even if the sons are young, shall be granted stipends of 3 persons' support going forward, as proclaimed. On the 16th day of the 10th month, this was announced to the magistrates at the castle.
　Cross-referenced with administrative office records【End small text】
　Hereafter, minor officials who receive New Year gifts and serve their duties well, when they die of illness, after investigation, even if their sons are young,
　《Marginal note: This was conveyed by Honda Sakon》
　shall be granted stipends for 3 persons' support, as proclaimed
One: The succession from minor official is to accountant, from accountant to clerk, as standard according to magistrate Katō Chōemon. However, under ancient law none of these positions had succession; this practice began in the middle ages. Among accountants there are hereditary accounting families, and the same applies to minor officials.
One: Bunka 9, Year of the Monkey, 3rd month, 20th day: When Nomura Tamemon, who held minor official rank with 12 koku and 3 persons' support, became ill, magistrate Kajikawa Hanbei submitted a petition requesting that a replacement be appointed. Today, due to the illness petition, his son was appointed as replacement with the same 12 koku and 3 persons' support and made an accountant.
　　Note: There is precedent with Kawabe Zenbei's illness replacement; he was a 12 koku minor official whose succession was appointed as 12 koku accountant
　One: Though it was a year when the lord was absent, this illness replacement was appointed without consultation with Edo. There is precedent when minor official Itō Buzaemon's illness replacement was petitioned and appointed without consultation.
One: Bunka 9, Year of the Monkey, 7th month: When inquiring about succession of minor officials and below to magistrate Ogawa Jibei, he reported handling cases as follows up to that time:

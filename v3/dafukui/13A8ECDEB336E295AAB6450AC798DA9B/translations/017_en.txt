Shirōzaemon being summoned to serve as a court page is a great favor for which we are deeply grateful. Having always held this sentiment, we petitioned through the unit leader Nishio Jinzaemon during Lord Tangenin's reign that Genshirō's fief be granted to Shirōzaemon, and that regarding Genshirō, only a small stipend allowance be granted so he could continue serving as before. However, the matter was left as it was, but now the above decision has been announced.

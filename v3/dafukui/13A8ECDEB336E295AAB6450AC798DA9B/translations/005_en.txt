1. On the 5th day of the 8th month of Kyōhō 7, year of the Tiger, regarding daikan Nakamura Matahyōe in addition to bugyō Senbon Tōzaemon. Matahyōe had been administering the difficult territories of Shinagase domain and had performed well in personnel appointments, so last year he was also appointed temporary administrator of Tōgō domain. He performed this duty excellently as well, so this year he continued as direct temporary administrator. Furthermore, since the administrative affairs of the lord's domain have encountered significant difficulties, though it is burdensome, he was ordered to exchange territories with Shinagase. Since he has been successively assigned to difficult territories, the matter of territorial reassignment was communicated by the karō.

Official duty records:
1. On the 15th day of the 10th month of Genbun 1, year of the Dragon, ō-oban-gashira Minagawa Tazaemon was appointed as rusuii, and ō-oban member Ajioka Hikodayū was appointed as gun-bugyō. These appointments were made directly before the lord. However, since Hikodayū belonged to Tazaemon's unit, he consulted with Tazaemon last evening and they attended together this morning. Nevertheless, since Tazaemon received a role change, he did not attend the unit's gratitude ceremony.

1. On the 24th day of the 4th month of Kyōhō 15, year of the Dog, regarding official duties and grants of new stipends and increased stipends to retainers: For ometsuke and above, all those outside regular units, and even within units when new stipends and increased stipends are granted, these are appointed directly by the lord. Official duties for unit members are communicated by the monthly duty karō. However, even when unit members are appointed to official duties and new stipends and increased stipends are granted together, the official duties are communicated by the karō, while the granting of new and increased stipends is done directly by the lord. This has been the practice through successive generations. When this was inquired about using this memorandum, it was decreed that appointments should follow precedent.

Since promotion requests from various quarters came to be submitted frequently throughout the year without regard to the proper timing, disrupting ancient practices, in the 12th month of Kōka 4 (1847), after deliberation among colleagues, the following was reported to the Senior Councilors: "At present, we have returned to the former practice of the lord residing in the domain every other year, so we would like promotions from various quarters to also occur every other year. Furthermore, regarding spring and autumn promotions during the lord's absence requiring inquiries to Edo, this was a practice that developed during the prolonged continuous residence in Edo, and in recent years even minor promotions on December 16th and January 16th required inquiries to Edo. However, originally spring and autumn promotions were not supposed to occur during the lord's absence. Therefore, for this year, only urgent and unavoidable cases should be handled with minor promotions before the conclusion of deliberations, and on December 16th only ceremonial promotions of low-ranking samurai should be handled minimally, ceasing inquiries to Edo." The Senior Councilors agreed, and this was implemented. Furthermore, colleagues also sent a private letter to Senmoto Tōzaemon, their counterpart in Edo, explaining this policy.

However, regarding spring and autumn promotions during years when the lord resides in the domain, inquiries should continue to be made for even minor cases as before. Based on this policy, on December 11th, at the Council Chamber, Monthly Duty Officer Yokota Sakudayū issued the following written directive to the chamberlains, magistrates, and other supervising officials:

"During the lord's absence, individual requests for promotions submitted through personal written petitions are not acceptable. When there are unavoidable circumstances, petitions through department heads are exceptional matters. The same applies to Edo.

〇Regarding the rice storage in the domain warehouses, although this has been ordered repeatedly in the past, it is reported that the situation has gradually worsened. This is not only detrimental to the lord but also causes great hardship to the retainers. Therefore, it is newly ordered that Akesato Warehouse and other warehouses should strictly inspect and handle matters according to ancient established laws. If there is negligent and shoddy handling of repair rope bags and other equipment needed for peasant work, strict punishment will be imposed after investigation. Moreover, while early rice varieties are not abundant, there is much damaged rice, etc.

[One line illegible]

　If this occurs, domain tools should be lent out at the warehouse locations, and the rice should be repaired and stored. As for late rice varieties, since the quantity is large, repairing may cause confusion and be difficult to order. Special care should be taken to ensure no shoddy work and proper storage.
1. While villages are delivering rice, according to domain policy, two deputy officials should take turns staying at Akesato Warehouse daily, recording village-by-village numbers and names by district, with daily duty officers circulating to each district. This way, the deputy officials' offices will also understand the daily rice delivery situation, and naturally inspection work will be thorough. Of course, during the busy collection period, deputy officials' duties may be hindered, but since there are many colleagues, they should coordinate to serve as much as possible. When unavoidably hindered, this should be reported to the Accounting Office.
1. Regarding the rice inspection foot soldiers, suitable and appropriate persons should be selected from among those experienced in this duty. The above should be communicated to the deputies and warehouse magistrates.

〇The buying and selling of Japanese red pine is prohibited. However, there are those who engage in secret sales, which is unacceptable, so this has been announced repeatedly, but it still continues. Recently, when peasants brought red pine to the market, two townsmen who immediately purchased it were punished. Since the identity of these peasants is unknown, the Mountain Magistrate should be instructed to order village officials to investigate, arrest, and present them.

Officials at all levels shall be strictly controlled as decreed, and since it has been ordered that farmers shall not be troubled, they must thoroughly obey the instructions of officials. Should farmers naturally misunderstand and commit selfish illegal acts, they will immediately be severely punished, so this point must be thoroughly understood.

1. Petitions may be freely submitted into the suggestion box according to the regulations
1. Regarding townspeople, recently they have forgotten their proper station and wear fine clothing beyond their means, adopting luxurious and extravagant customs. This naturally becomes the foundation of decline, so they must avoid such misunderstandings
1. Townspeople's behavior should also correspond to their station. If they think that elaborate cuisine is necessary, relationships with relatives and acquaintances will naturally become distant, and occasions like adoptions and weddings will require excessive expenses, creating a custom where such matters are considered burdensome. They should handle matters lightly and maintain close relationships. Even at tea houses, ordinary matters should be managed adequately. Splendid affairs should be avoided. Misunderstandings in this regard also become the foundation of decline
1. High prices for all goods cause hardship for everyone. Of course, it is the custom of merchant houses to make a living through profit, but there should be moderation. They should not greedily pursue high interest but should understand that reasonable prices and good circulation are important

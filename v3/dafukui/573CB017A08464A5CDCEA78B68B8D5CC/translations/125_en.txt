　　　　The following orders were given by the Senior Retainers with written instructions

○Regarding the addressing of letters between Guard Captains and Inspectors when including the lord's name, both sides claimed precedence based on old customs and could not reach agreement. When we quietly inquired of both offices, each had reasonable grounds, and it was difficult to determine which should be used. Therefore, abandoning past practices, we have now reached a new decision through deliberation, so both sides should make no further claims on this matter.

One: It has come to our attention that six-part pilgrims, twenty-four pilgrimage practitioners, and chongare bean merchant types are entering even the small alleys of the town districts. When such persons enter side alleys, not even small coins should be given to them, as was previously announced in official notices, but this has been neglected. While main thoroughfares are exceptional, regarding side alleys, even the smallest coins should not be given to such types of people. Though this concerns charitable giving, if many such persons enter, they naturally become accomplices to thieves, which is detrimental to town security. Therefore, town headmen should strictly instruct townspeople house by house, and each should strictly observe not to relax these rules at all. If such persons do enter, town headmen should consult together and send them away. If negligence is reported, punishment will certainly be imposed.

One: It was previously ordered that people and horses from other provinces should not travel through Edo-machi street, but recently this has been neglected.

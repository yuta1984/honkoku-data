　　　　　Separate Document
One: Due to recent financial difficulties, austerity measures have been announced repeatedly, but the original policy of modest revenue collection has become a temporary matter, causing hardship for the upper ranks. Consequently, even though excessive rice loans are ordered annually from the domain retainers, this proves ineffective, and fortunes continue to decline. At present, there seems to be no solution at all. Financial matters have reached a critical point. While there may be thoughts of negligence among various officials, this is not limited to current personnel, and particularly since current officials have not been in their positions long, this matter will not be subject to official censure. However, leaving things in this state would be unacceptable, so after internal consultations with important personages, a policy of continuation has been established. Financial reform must absolutely be undertaken, as there are matters that cannot be resolved both internally and externally. Since continuation policies cannot be implemented through ordinary measures, policies will be announced gradually as intended. First, the intentions are being communicated to each department through written instructions, so please understand and inform your subordinates accordingly.

One: The policy period is set for seven years
One: During this period, the upper ranks will practice complete austerity in all aspects of their lifestyle. Even for matters that have been ordered, if they would result in losses, inquiries should be made repeatedly for corrections, and suggestions should be made for greater economy
One: While such intentions have been expressed repeatedly, there has been a tendency toward excessive restraint, which is quite counterproductive. It is said that besides the retainers, there is no one else to speak for the lord's benefit. This point should be thoroughly communicated
One: This time, the policy has been fundamentally changed from before, so understanding this well, starting from minor official duties

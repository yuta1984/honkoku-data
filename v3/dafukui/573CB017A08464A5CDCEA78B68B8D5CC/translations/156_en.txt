Head of Naval Personnel　
○The boatmen of Kamisekida Village and Zaita Village in the domain of Lord Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami have petitioned to perform boat duties in the same manner as the boatmen of our domain, and have also submitted this petition to the Tennō administrative office. Since the Tennō officials made inquiries about this matter, a general investigation of the boatmen in our domain was conducted. It was found that granting their petition would cause no problems and would actually be convenient. The decision has been communicated to the magistrates for their understanding. If granting the petition as requested would indeed cause no problems, appropriate measures should be taken accordingly.
Article 1: The boat carpenters in our domain have not been performing official duties until now, but they have recently petitioned that they be allowed to perform official duties and that carpenters from other places and domains should not be permitted to enter our domain and work indiscriminately. It has been communicated that granting this petition would cause no hindrance. If implementing this as requested would indeed cause no problems, it should be handled appropriately.

○The following should be communicated to subordinates as detailed in the separate document, and also strictly communicated as proclaimed in the fifth year of Kansei, Year of the Ox.
　　　　　　Separate Document
○Recently, it has been roughly reported that thieves, arsonists, extortionists and such are wandering around various places in rural areas. Such individuals should be immediately arrested upon discovery. If they resist, they may be handled forcefully, and it is acceptable even if this results in injury or immediate death. When arrested, there is no need for village officials to accompany them; the details should be written down thoroughly and submitted to the administrative office through village relay. Mistaken arrests are acceptable, so handle strictly. If it is later learned that villages discovered such individuals but dispersed them and handled the matter leniently, those villages will be punished, so be vigilant and strict in your attention. Depending on the case, rewards may be granted. Although such matters were communicated before, they are proclaimed again at this time with renewed emphasis.
　　　　　Seventh Month, Twenty-first Day
　Addendum: Yesterday on the twentieth, the town office issued the following notice to the townspeople. Note that at this time, there was also a notice to the retainers.
○Recently, there have been reports of thieves or arsonists in various places. If such individuals are discovered, they should be captured on the spot and reported immediately. If they resist, they may be handled forcefully, and it is acceptable even if this results in injury or immediate death. If such individuals are dispersed and the matter handled leniently, and this is later discovered, punishment will certainly be imposed. Although this matter was communicated before, since everyone's attention appears to have become lax and this is improper, it is proclaimed again with renewed emphasis. Be especially vigilant and conduct strict investigations at this time. If such individuals are arrested, reward may be granted. These instructions should be communicated without fail throughout the entire town area, including temple and shrine precincts, rental housing areas, tenant farmer areas, etc., ensuring no area is overlooked.

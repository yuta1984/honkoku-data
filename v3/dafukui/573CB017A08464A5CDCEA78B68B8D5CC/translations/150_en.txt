Regarding this investigation, those who hastily fabricate justifications and present them will definitely not be accepted.
However, during investigation, if they are identified as persons from Mikuni or Fuchu, both these places should be notified that investigation by the official authorities is required.

Article 1: Employing persons from other domains or territories is forbidden. However, the regulations for those staying for service with proper justification are:
Men: January, one month; Women: January and July; Emergency cases: both men and women shall not exceed fifteen days.
The above is acceptable, but without proper service arrangements, staying beyond these time limits is absolutely not permitted.

Article 1: Merchants' lodging shall not exceed fifteen days. If there are impediments to their business, they must apply for extensions from the relevant parties citing the impediments. For persons of verified identity, this will be decided based on investigation at that time.

Understanding these principles, orders should be given for departure by the 18th of this month. If town officials conduct negligent investigations, this will be considered misconduct. After His Lordship's departure, the handling by town officials will be investigated by the inspector's office, so instructions should be given without error.
March 11th
However, rural areas should also be handled according to the above principles, as decreed to the Four District Magistrates on the following 12th.

District Head
○ Regarding this policy initiative, loan silver has been ordered through the currency office arrangements. The interest rate is set at 8 shu per month, to be paid annually at the end of the 11th month. The principal silver should also be repaid at that time, but if there are no particular constraints and it serves as financial assistance, continued borrowing may be permitted, so the circumstances at that time should be reported. Furthermore, repayment of principal and interest should be made in the third year on a rotating basis. The allocation of this policy silver has been decreed as follows, so arrangements should be made to lend to subordinates and establish this policy:

600 ryō in gold: Loan silver to Kawakita domain; 1,000 ryō in gold: Same to town areas
1,800 ryō in gold: Same to three districts (600 ryō each to one district)

Inspector
○ Regarding this policy initiative, loan silver has been ordered through currency office arrangements. Therefore, if joint guarantee borrowing by various groups would serve as financial assistance, applications should be made through district heads. Interest is 8 shu per month, with principal and interest to be repaid annually at the end of the 11th month. Furthermore, regarding the principal silver, if application is made at that time, continued borrowing will be permitted, with principal and interest repayment in the third year on a rotating basis. This should be communicated to all those with group supervision responsibilities.

Currency Office Inspector
○ The same as the above two notices.

Assistant Currency Office Inspector, Currency Office Magistrate
○ Regarding the policy silver for towns, rural areas, and joint guarantee loans by various groups that was previously decreed, it was announced that loans would be made to those applying with monthly interest of 1 bu. When internal approval was given to the district heads, they requested that loans be made with reduced interest rates. Therefore, it was unavoidably decreed at 8 shu per month. However, since currency office silver had previously been loaned at 1 bu per month, Yoshida Mozaemon {{marginal note: Currency Office Inspector}} reported that this would cause problems, but since this policy silver is a special case, the previous currency office silver loans...

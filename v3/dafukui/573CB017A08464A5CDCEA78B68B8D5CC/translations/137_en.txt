　　　　As stated in the separate document sent from Edo, this should be understood accordingly.
　　　　　　　　Kitagata-ura, Sakai District, Echizen Province

○ The above matter: In the previous Tiger Year, when inquiries were made about coastal villages, the district office wrote around and based on that, an investigation ledger was compiled and submitted to the castle. However, last month on the 28th, there was a summons to the castle with an announcement that in the previously submitted provincial maps and village tax registers, it was written as "Kitagata-ura," but they asked when the characters were changed and to investigate and report on this matter. Deliberations were held here, and when the tax registers and provincial maps attached to the official seal were examined, all showed "Kitagata-ura." Since delays would be problematic, the scribe claimed it was a writing error from before and the matter was resolved by replacement. Therefore, henceforth, to avoid mistakes in writing, it should be written as "Kitagata," and this should be ordered to all respective parties.

○ Due to the great flood on August 28th and 29th, there were considerable losses and unexpected expenses, which is truly regrettable. Particularly, the construction work at Shibahara upper water inlet is unavoidable, causing excessive costs in one location, and given the current circumstances, this causes extreme distress among colleagues. Although the various departments should understand this matter, they should handle all affairs to avoid even small wasteful expenses and perform all duties strictly, and this should be thoroughly communicated to all departments.

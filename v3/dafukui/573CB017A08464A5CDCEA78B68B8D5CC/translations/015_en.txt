To All Departments
○Since last year, cost-cutting measures have been ordered by his lordship's will, and it is commendable that all departments have shown good judgment and, through careful management of their operations, have achieved even small reductions in expenses. You should continue to exercise prudence and not become lax in this matter.

○Regarding the conduct of farmers, instructions have been given previously, and particularly strict orders were issued last autumn. However, it has been reported that there is some relaxation in compliance. Strict notices shall be issued again, and if there are any who violate the orders in the future, each official shall conduct investigations at their offices and report accordingly.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Town Magistrate
○Regarding the conduct of townspeople, strict orders were issued last autumn, but as time passes, there tends to be natural relaxation, which is unacceptable. However, issuing repeated notices might interfere with business operations depending on how the townspeople interpret them, which would be problematic. The matter of enforcement should be handled with your own discretion. Generally, if people refrain from dealing in luxurious goods, whether tools, clothing, or other items, expenses will naturally decrease. Consider these matters and handle them appropriately going forward.

　　　　　Separate document to be communicated to deputy officials　　Magistrate
○Due to the recent flooding, it has been reported that in some flood-affected villages, standing crops that actually survived the flood damage are being neglected and abandoned. Such behavior is unacceptable. Conduct strict investigations, and for any surviving crops, however small, ensure they are not neglected. Of course, care must be taken in handling matters so that there is no confusion between previously abandoned land and newly damaged areas. Since instructions have been given previously, there should be no misunderstanding, but if there are any mistakes and officials only focus on disaster relief while neglecting the most important farmland, resulting in its deterioration becoming known to outsiders, the deputy officials will be held responsible for negligence. Convey this message accordingly.

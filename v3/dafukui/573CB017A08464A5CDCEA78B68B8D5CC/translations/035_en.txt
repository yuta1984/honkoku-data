However, it has been heard that until now they have been staying at post stations near the castle town and entering the castle town. Regarding future matters, while overnight stays are exceptional, if they appear to be extended stays, innkeepers should be ordered to report this, and then group members should be immediately dispatched for investigation.

○ Regarding lodging fees at various post stations, there should be nothing improper, but prices should be lowered as much as possible so travelers do not suffer hardship. Additionally, wholesalers, teahouses, horse borrowers and similar persons must be strictly ordered not to engage in illegal or greedy behavior toward travelers. Furthermore, detailed investigations should be conducted and strict orders given to each party accordingly.

1. Recently, medicine sellers from other domains and bean storage imitator-type persons have been frequently entering the castle town. Regarding future matters, while routine passage is exceptional, if they enter small streets and alleys, they should be immediately expelled by that neighborhood. If this is neglected, it will be the fault of the town officials. Of course, such persons absolutely cannot stay overnight in the castle town, so innkeepers must be strictly ordered again.

【Vermillion notation】Happyakuri considers: Last year on October 25th such an order was issued, so why is a similar order being issued again?

1. Regarding medicine sellers from other domains, the mekiki (police agents) have conducted examinations and issued permits allowing them to stay in the castle town, but such practices are now prohibited. Henceforth, issuing permits is forbidden. This should be communicated to the mekiki.

1. Puppet theater and other entertainments by persons from other domains are prohibited.

1. Since the lord's arrival in Saru year, with gracious consideration, direct orders were issued to all retainers at the main castle regarding frugality, clothing, and gatherings. Accordingly, townspeople should also understand and follow these guidelines. However, while townspeople may differ from retainers, luxurious behavior has been heard of, which shows misunderstanding. Since people from other domains visit town houses, they find simple clothing troublesome and naturally tend to wear fine goods. During these times of strict orders, this is most inappropriate. Moreover, it affects the lord's reputation with people from other domains. While wanting to wear fine clothing when dealing with outsiders is natural human sentiment, if townspeople also avoid extravagance and wear simple clothing, people from other domains will see this as evidence of strict governance and tight control. Henceforth, even when dealing with people from other domains, fine clothing should not be worn - simple clothing should be used.

1. Habutae silk, crepe, gauze, twill, silk, velvet, mousseline, figured satin, gauze, dragon patterns, genuine Hachijo silk, stripes and similar materials must not be used.

1. Cha-o hemp, kohaku, Tango silk, seiko, plain weave and similar materials must not be used for formal wear and hakama.

1. Bleached silk, Echigo crepe, Ueda stripes, Gunai stripes, cotton, pongee, thick weave and similar materials may be used.

1. Zanryū, Gunai plain weave, Shōtoku plain weave and similar materials may be used.

1. Men's and women's obi with woven patterns and gold threads are forbidden.

1. Women's combs, hairpins and similar items should also follow these guidelines and avoid luxury.

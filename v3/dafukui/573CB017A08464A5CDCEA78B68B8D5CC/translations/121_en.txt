○Regarding the delivery of circulating rice and rice in the husk at Mikuni port, while there is no change to established practices, strict control is once again ordered, so the delivery handling must be carried out with utmost care. Should any shortage in the measure of circulating rice bales be discovered, detailed supplementary rice must be provided for each bale according to the deficiency. In recent years, significant reductions in rice volume have been discovered during warehouse storage in Edo and Osaka, and particularly in the previous Year of the Ox, excessive reductions were discovered, making warehouse storage difficult. If requests for rice purchases are made, this would be inconvenient for the administration. Moreover, the tax-collecting village headmen also face hardship, and there are concerns about careless handling at collection points. If there are official reports that inspections by officials at collection points are inadequate, this would affect administrative convenience and create difficulties throughout the districts. Therefore, strict orders have been given to ensure that the people of Mikuni port have no misunderstandings or questionable handling during ship loading and departure. Understanding this, all matters must be handled with utmost strictness.

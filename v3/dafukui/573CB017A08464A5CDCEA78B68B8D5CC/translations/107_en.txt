The intent of the reform has been announced, and all officials are particularly apprehensive. Since this is an extremely difficult time, the peasants should diligently work their assigned farmland without negligence, observe all regulations, and devote themselves to tax payments to serve the lord's benefit. Village officials and small farmers alike should be made to understand this through the district administrators. Of course, the district administrators and their subordinates should also understand their duties. The supervisory heads should ensure that rural headmen and small farmers alike understand this.

One: Regarding rice deliveries to Akesato granary and various other granaries, as well as all tax rice payments, previously the rice sold in town markets was well-maintained with proper repairs and even superior rope bags, showing evidence that peasants took great care with their tax deliveries. Recently, however, granary rice has been treated carelessly, and instead good rice is being sold off, which has become commonplace. Whether this is due to village officials' inadequate rice management or peasants not following officials' rice management guidelines, this is extremely inappropriate. Going against previous proclamations and allowing villages to sell off good rice at will would make it difficult to maintain the quality of granary rice. While local rice conditions and yearly harvests are exceptional matters, peasants should carefully and properly handle rice repairs and rope bag production within their capabilities. Ultimately, the negligence of officials who supervise the delivery process naturally leads to peasants' misunderstandings, so henceforth officials' management should be strictly enforced without any carelessness.
To supervisors: This matter should be strictly communicated as instructed by the magistrates.
Even after these instructions, if there is negligence, not only peasants but also officials will face reprimand. Therefore, henceforth all tax rice should be treated with care as before, with strict orders given to village officials, and even small farmers should understand this.

○Regarding Three-Country granary deliveries: Previously peasants delivered directly, but since ancient times it became convenient for peasants, so twenty contract day laborers were established. One delivery peasant would go to the granary, provide wage rice from the rice owner to these contract workers, and make custom deliveries. However, delivery handling became crude, and since those handling bag rotation and measure-taking were experienced workers, there were instances of personal misconduct. Therefore, henceforth the previous system of contract day laborers for custom deliveries will be discontinued, and direct peasant delivery will be implemented as with Akesato granary.

One: Regarding this matter, officials dispatched for Three-Country granary rice delivery duties and their assistants previously received field rations and lodged in Three-Country townhouses, but henceforth field rations will be discontinued. They shall prepare living quarters within the granary compound and receive miscellaneous expenses for their own livelihood.

One: Previously, dispatched officials receiving only field rations sometimes lost their lodging arrangements, so villages provided contribution funds for lodging fees. If the above is implemented, village repairs of living quarters should be ordered as replacement for these contribution funds.

One: Regarding designated rice and allocated rice payments: Previously granary guards and day laborers received wage rice, with the remainder sold through bidding, with proceeds going to savings. However, due to current financial reforms, designated rice and allocated rice payments have also become crude.

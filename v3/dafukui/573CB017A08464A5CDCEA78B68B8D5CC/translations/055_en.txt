1. In recent years, carpenters going to Edo have shown disrespect toward young retainers such as boatmen. Even if lightly armed, if they are standard bearers, they should have proper understanding, but since carpenters are not standard bearers but townspeople, they appear to have indiscriminate understanding. Since there was an order in the past year of the boar, it is ordered that carpenters serving at the construction office and those going to Edo should henceforth have no misunderstandings.

1. Both in Edo and in the domain, when carpenters wear formal dress such as hakama, they shall wear wakizashi, but on ordinary days they are ordered to be unarmed. Village headmen should understand this as before.
　　However, regarding travel routes and other domains, this should be understood as before.

Moreover, the expenses for farmers have become excessive, so henceforth the practice of employing scribes should be stopped. Even if inconvenient, if villagers write them themselves, everything will reflect reality, which would be appropriate. If villagers cannot write them, they should be written at the various offices as with oral statements.

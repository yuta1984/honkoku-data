○Regarding the rapeseed shipments to Osaka previously ordered by the shogunate, without strict regulation of ship traffic at Mikuni Port and other ports, investigations cannot be thoroughly conducted. Within the upper territory, Kono Port and Imaizumi Port have been previously authorized locations for shipping various products to other provinces. Last summer, orders were issued by the shogunate regarding rapeseed handling methods, and further regulations were ordered. However, since there were no port fees until now, inspections of various goods were inadequate, rapeseed quantities were unclear, and reports could not be completed. With repeated inquiries from the shogunate and successive investigation orders, inspection officials have been appointed from this year. Due to losses incurred, port fees similar to those at Mikuni Port are now ordered to be collected. This matter should be communicated to each relevant party

○Since the previous Year of the Ox, special policies have been proclaimed, ordering half-reduction rice loans for retainers, and during the designated period, strict economy measures have required the elimination of all unnecessary expenses. However, since crop inspections in rural areas require expenses, they have been temporarily suspended from this Year of the Snake. Regarding the financial difficulties, as everyone knows, unlike other provinces, our domain has no surplus land, and the problem stems from the countless small tax units. While rural areas are also in a state of hardship, due to these exceptional times, cost-saving measures have been proclaimed as detailed in the separate document. Regarding years with particularly poor harvests, exceptional measures have been proclaimed allowing return to village-based tax assessment regardless of previous practices. This matter should be communicated thoroughly to the deputy officials for proper handling.

　　　　　　Separate Document
○From this Year of the Snake, crop inspections in rural areas are temporarily suspended according to policy. Regarding village-by-village tax assessments, villages that have been conducting assessments as before should continue with the same tax rates.
Article 1: Villages that have had reduced tax rates due to recent crop failures, as well as other villages with reduced rates, should have their rates restored.
Article 1: For areas that became wasteland due to repeated floods in recent years, after strict examination of land recovery efforts, areas not yet restored should receive assistance through rice allowances.
Article 1: Annual wasteland allowances and fixed allowances should be reduced after investigation.
Article 1: Regarding reductions in rice allowances given to villages due to extreme hardship, areas with reductions of one-fifth or more should continue as before, while all others should have reductions set at one-fifth.
Article 1: Villages that petition for barren field assistance should receive help through rice allowances after officials conduct pole surveys and investigations.
Article 1: In recent years, when villages claim crop failures and officials investigate, some villages appear to be making claims without substantial basis. Such crop failure claims should not be accepted. However, for cases where villages face genuine hardship on the borderline of crop failure, deputy officials should thoroughly investigate and report. After officials are dispatched and investigations conducted, appropriate assistance should be provided.
　The above has been ordered according to this year's policy. As proclaimed previously, to ensure no wasteful losses or unnecessary expenses in rural areas, if deputy officials have opinions after further investigation, they should report them. It is essential that farmers avoid extravagance, exercise restraint in all matters, focus diligently on agriculture, maintain their livelihood, and fulfill their tax obligations. This should be communicated to all villages under respective jurisdictions as proclaimed. End.

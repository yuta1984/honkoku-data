〇Regarding the paper industry of the Five Villages, this has been an ancient matter and has special circumstances different from other places. For official government business and such, certification seals have been assigned to officials from long ago, which is an extremely important matter. In this regard, those who have learned paper-making and production methods should not be sent to other places or villages, but should be kept within the Five Villages so that paper-making and production methods are not hindered. However, carelessly sending servants to other places and villages is a misunderstanding by both the Five Villages officials and the paper merchants. After explaining this matter and scolding them, they must strictly be ordered not to send servants to other places and villages as before. Regarding the paper merchants, they should sufficiently reconcile and consult together, arrange for more people to learn paper-making and production methods and gradually become more skilled, and understand how to gradually make the paper industry prosper. This matter must be strictly communicated to the paper merchants. In general, not sending local people to other places and villages, increasing the population to encourage agriculture and other occupations, applying oneself diligently so as not to hinder tax collection and official duties - this is what farmers should constantly observe. Hereafter, so that there are no further misunderstandings, the Five Villages officials must be ordered to achieve harmony in village discussions and apply themselves diligently.

〇Regarding post-horse contracting, since the year before last (Year of the Tiger), each should be assigned to the innkeepers of each post station as examined. Furthermore, the innkeepers should handle things properly and strive to reduce local silver contributions as much as possible, and this should be strictly ordered. When members of each group serve on duty, they should also be ordered to avoid misunderstandings.
1. So that travelers on regular journeys do not suffer hardship, each inn should understand various matters, and should understand to show special compassion to the elderly, young, sick, or those on pilgrimage to Ise. In general, so that there are no careless or rude behaviors, this should be communicated to innkeepers after each discusses among themselves.
1. Regarding the applications for installment payments of government policy silver borrowed by post-horse contractors who served until last year (Year of the Rabbit), since this concerns important government policy silver, approval is difficult. However, since each person's petition has unavoidable circumstances, as a special measure after deliberation, the principal will be transferred for interest-free installment payments. Therefore, from this Year of the Dragon until the coming Year of the Ox, payments should be collected annually by the December 15th deadline and submitted without fail. However, each loan portion is 6 kan 400 monme.

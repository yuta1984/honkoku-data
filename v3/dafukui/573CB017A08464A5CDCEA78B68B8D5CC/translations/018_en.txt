○Regarding the domain finances (okatte-muki), which have long been in financial distress, this summer's unprecedented great flood caused extensive losses, creating even greater difficulties. Under these circumstances, there is no alternative but to request financial assistance from townspeople and farmers. However, since everyone has suffered hardships from this great flood, the lord is deeply concerned about their plight. While the lord intends to issue orders for extraordinary frugality and tightening measures, there is no immediate way to manage current expenses, so financial arrangements will be made as per internal consultation. Those listed on the separate roster are ordered to appear at our residence (Sasaji Ichigaku's place) on the 6th and 7th at four o'clock. You must attend personally.　　　　　　Separate roster omitted

○Regarding the domain finances, which have long been in distress, this summer's unprecedented great flood caused losses, creating even greater difficulties. Under these circumstances, there is no alternative but to request financial assistance from townspeople and farmers. However, since both rural areas and townspeople have suffered hardships from this flood, the lord is deeply concerned. Therefore, while the lord intends to issue orders for extraordinary frugality and tightening measures, there is no immediate way to manage current expenses, so after internal consultation, financial arrangements will be made. Just as thirty internal procurement agents were appointed from town and countryside last autumn according to the lord's intentions, you are now appointed as internal procurement agents. You must thoroughly consult with those thirty persons and work diligently on financial arrangements. Regarding these tightening measures and the repayment of procured funds, Hayashi Hachiemon has been put in charge, and the magistrates will consult and arrange all matters. Recognizing this as a truly critical situation, everyone should work accordingly.

○Due to the long-standing financial difficulties of the domain finances, you were appointed as internal procurement agents last autumn and asked to handle financial arrangements. Through everyone's sincere consultations and gradual efforts, current management has been achieved, bringing satisfaction to the lord, and gradual tightening measures were to be implemented. However, this summer's unprecedented flood caused excessive losses in rural areas, and with additional river maintenance construction requiring enormous expenses, financial difficulties have increased further. This has been reported to Edo and received by the lord, who is deeply concerned and intends to issue orders for extraordinary frugality and strict controls. However, since there is no immediate way to manage current expenses, there is no alternative but to request financial assistance from townspeople and farmers. Since both rural areas and townspeople have suffered hardships from this flood, additional procurement agents beyond your group have been appointed through internal consultation. You must continue thorough consultations and arrange funding to manage through the current year-end.

〇This spring, we were compelled to order a half-reduction in rice loans, but this year rice prices are low, and we are greatly concerned that everyone will face particular hardship. We would like to completely forgive all rice loans from the coming Year of the Boar, but since our finances are originally in an extremely difficult state, we have no choice but to order rice loans at the usual eight-bu rate as in previous years, with the half-reduction being forgiven. Of course, various tribute payments should be understood to remain as last year. However, since everyone is enduring hardship while performing their duties, for the coming Year of the Boar, you are ordered to continue with reductions in all matters as with the half-reduction, so each person should understand this. The above.
　However, regarding the exemption of keeping horses for the coming Year of the Boar, those who receive official stipends will be ordered to pay one-third of their stipends as rice loans.

〇The personnel groups outside the regular teams of various offices have been gradually increasing in recent years, which is naturally due to the increase in official duties, but since this is a time when particularly strict economy measures have been ordered, arrangements should be made so that even the lowest-ranking personnel can fulfill their duties in their departments while enduring hardship, and personnel recruitment from other groups should be reduced. Moreover, among various departments, there may be some where official duties will particularly increase due to official policy, so in such cases, personnel should be added after separate deliberation. The above principles should be understood.

〇Due to the severe flood damage two years ago, we were compelled to order half-reduced rice loans in the previous Year of the Dog, and although everyone must have faced particular hardship due to this flood damage, they completed their tribute payments without delay, which is extremely satisfactory. Furthermore, as ordered in the previous Year of the Dog, you should be mindful not to relax in matters of economy and continue your service accordingly.

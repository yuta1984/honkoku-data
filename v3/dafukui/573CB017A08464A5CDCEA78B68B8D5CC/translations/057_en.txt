Can be communicated accordingly.

○ Regarding the inquiry about medicinal herbs at the deputy territories the other day, although there was notification as written in the attached document, since the examination of medicinal herbs is limited to the deputy territories, it is not clear. According to the attached document, bear bile is produced in the mountainous areas of Nanjō District and Ōno District in this province, as well as in private domains under the jurisdiction of deputy governors, but since it is unclear which deputy governor's territory or whose domain it is, judgment is difficult. This matter will also be further examined, and notification will be given later regarding the source of origin. Regarding this, today the territories under direct control should also examine the medicinal herbs listed in the attached document and submit them little by little. Of course, it is not limited to the two medicinal herbs in the attached document; if there are other medicinal herbs, they should also be submitted. Also, matters regarding prices should be examined and reported. Naturally, even for the medicinal herbs submitted in small quantities this time, the price should be declared. Accordingly, Goemon-dono ordered that entries and seals be made in the official record book, and this matter should also be reported to Echizen-no-kami-dono. The written acknowledgment is recorded below.

Memorandum of Written Acknowledgment
Having heard the purport of the attached document regarding the handling of medicinal herbs produced in various provinces, if they are produced in that province, they are needed for official use this time, so first submit small quantities of those items to this location.

Even for items listed in the document, if those specific items are not available but the production areas are known, report the circumstances and the prices of the medicinal herbs. This matter was ordered by Etchū-no-kami-dono, so I hereby communicate it. Above.

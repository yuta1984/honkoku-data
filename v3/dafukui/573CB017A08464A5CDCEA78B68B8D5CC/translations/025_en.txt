unprecedented flood caused excessive crop damage in the domain, last year's harvest was severely reduced, and on top of that, the great flood caused enormous damage requiring massive repairs that accumulated costs. By last winter, the domain finances were completely unmanageable, and though various temporary expedients were employed to get by, the situation continued to worsen with increasing financial pressures. The officials had no way to manage, and from official duties onward, it truly became a time of critical financial crisis. Therefore, even more changes were made to outward appearances from the lord's personal funds, and extraordinary frugality measures were ordered, but there was no way to manage. Even among the retainers, long-term rice loans had been ordered, causing extreme hardship and difficulties. Though it was thought difficult to announce, there was no other way, and unavoidably, half-reduced rice loans were requested from the retainers for this year. Furthermore, strict frugality was implemented and financial continuation policies were established. For each individual, frugality goes without saying - in all matters, economies should be made however possible, and continued loyal service should be performed as the lord wishes. This matter should be communicated thoroughly as ordered. For this purpose, Shimada Samon and Arakawa Matahachiro were dispatched. End.

〇Due to ongoing financial difficulties in domain finances, various policies have been announced many times and all efforts have been exhausted. However, in recent years there have been unavoidable expenses, particularly last year when the home domain suffered an unprecedented great flood causing excessive crop damage, and moreover many large construction sites that required urgent attention as defensive positions could not be abandoned, so construction work was ordered successively. This led to extreme financial difficulties that truly interfered with official duties. Due to this critical financial crisis, a special resolution was made, and important communications were sent to the higher authorities. Strict frugality measures are ordered for ten years starting from this year of the dog. Regardless of family status or personal position, policies of simplicity in all matters are to be established as the lord's intention. Until now, everyone has worked diligently despite impoverished working conditions, but facing such times, though regrettable, everyone will likely face increased busy duties. The intention is that everyone should work with utmost diligence. Of course, regarding frugality among retainers, without regard for others, they should increasingly observe it and continue their loyal service as ordered.

　　　However, on the same day, Sakai Hamon reported that since half-reduction was announced today, following precedent, those with holdings of 1000 koku or less are exempted from keeping horses, and he was told to communicate this through us to each person. Accordingly, regarding those horse-keeping individuals, after consulting with the senior retainers whether to inform them they may dispose of their horses at their discretion, it was communicated to each person.

has been gradually completed through public works, so from this year we should return to previous levels, and the labor costs should be significantly reduced compared to the situation since the Year of the Rooster. Since the uneven distribution of profits and losses in rural areas is undesirable, deliberation has been ordered for the benefit of all, so officials at all levels should explain this matter to village officials and farmers.

First, previously it was ordered that both the Hawking Department and Irrigation Department should manage with auxiliary labor allocation of 15,000 people, but as construction sites have gradually increased and this number of laborers is insufficient, from this year it has been ordered to each department that they should manage with the following labor allocation, and each department should exercise discretion in deployment:

First, 10,000 people for the Hawking Department　First, 15,000 people for the Irrigation Department
　　　　However, if there are extraordinary emergency matters, thorough investigation should be conducted and appropriate measures taken at that time.

As stated above, the annual labor allocation shall be fixed, and discretion should be exercised in conducting annual construction work.

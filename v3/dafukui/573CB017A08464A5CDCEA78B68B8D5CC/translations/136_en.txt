○ Regarding the tax collection from villages under direct administration: Although there should be no negligence in handling procedures according to yearly good harvests, due to continued poor crops, unavoidable tax reductions have been necessary. Despite repeated strict orders issued, no effectiveness is seen. Moreover, during the inspection ordered in the previous Dog Year, when crop conditions were slightly better and appropriate tax collection was possible, whenever deliberations suggest that handling procedures are inadequate, this reflects poorly and does not benefit the villages either. Therefore, the farmers should be instructed to act with sincerity and avoid misunderstandings, and the local governors should take great care to handle all matters without negligence.

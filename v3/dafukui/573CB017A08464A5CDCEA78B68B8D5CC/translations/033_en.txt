○ At Edo, from this past New Year, by special imperial consideration and intent, examinations of expenses for all offices were ordered to be completed within one month's limit. Account book formats were prepared and distributed by the accounting office, and currently everything is being handled according to the imperial intent. Accordingly, it has been ordered that domestic matters be handled similarly. We consulted with magistrates and made inquiry some time ago, and now that the format account books are complete, handling according to the imperial intent shall begin from the first day of the sixth month. Further consultation with magistrates is required.

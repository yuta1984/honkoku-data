Various Monthly Duty Officers

○Due to the critical financial difficulties (okatte) of the domain causing serious disruptions, as commanded through copies of the direct letter (chokusho) from last winter, since we are in such grave times that could affect major domain affairs, the financial policy for the next seven years starting from this year of the Ox is hereby announced. There are particular requests regarding this matter, and it should be announced immediately, but while this would serve as guidance for everyone, due to unavoidable circumstances, it will be announced publicly after the lord's departure. Regarding this, attendants and servants should be reduced as much as possible. Since this is also the season for personnel changes, this matter is to be communicated as ordered.

1. For those with small stipends of less than 200 koku, there will be special allowances. Details will be communicated by the magistrates after the public announcement. This matter is to be communicated for your information as ordered.

○Regarding the announcement made last July that children of foot soldiers (ashigaru) and monk attendants, even when summoned to service, will not succeed to their parents' positions and will not become branch families - it seems that this is not fully understood at lower levels. From those summoned after the aforementioned announcement, this will be changed from now on, so the magistrates should be informed of this understanding directly. Of course, the general supervisor of foot soldiers should also be informed.

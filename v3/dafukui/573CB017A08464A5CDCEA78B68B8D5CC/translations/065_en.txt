[Continued from line 22 of the left page of the previous frame]
Article 1: With such fortune, we cannot justify ourselves to the shogunate, so although I have given various instructions in recent years, they have not been thorough. In any case, if we do not achieve financial recovery to some degree during my reign, it will not be acceptable. However, if we leave things in this condition, as I have already announced, it will clearly interfere with supporting the retainer band. If that happens, it will be even more unacceptable and regrettable. Therefore, if the purpose of the financial recovery adjustment methods I have ordered can be fully realized without delay, there should come a time when both high and low can feel at ease. Of course, this is not a matter of a day or night, and rectifying generations of financial difficulties is not an easy matter. Therefore, temporarily the retainer band must again rely on difficult matters on top of hardships, or the foundation for continuation cannot be established. Gradually this will require attention. If we unite in all things and can continue as intended, eventually all members of the retainer band should be able to feel secure. I want to convey this point, so I have written this in my own hand and am passing it along.

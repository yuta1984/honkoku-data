○From ancient times, the Amemori Denzaemon family has held a special house rank with exemption from contribution silver (yonai-gin), which is an exceptional matter. In ancient times, there were no orders for family retainer rice loans, but in current times the circumstances have changed, and if contribution silver exemption were to continue, there would be impediments, so they shall be treated the same as other family retainers. Of course, when there are no rice loans as in ancient times, they shall be exempted according to their house rank as before. This matter should be communicated to Denzaemon.

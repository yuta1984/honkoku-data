1. Regarding the entrusted territories, there are many official expenses, so until now the rice payment funds have covered shortfalls in official reserves. However, since the annual small amounts provide little assistance, henceforth they shall become reserve funds, and when the monetary amount increases, they can provide substantial assistance. This has been ordered, so this matter should be understood.
　　However, the rice payment funds from the previous Ox year that were submitted this year shall be managed as reserve funds.
The above should be understood and implemented. The magistrates should also inform the Policy Office to handle matters in this manner.

Not only routine matters but also extraordinary affairs should be thoroughly discussed and investigated as ordered. Therefore, each person is assigned to this duty. Additionally, others are assigned to this duty as listed in the attached document, and this should be communicated.

To the Magistrate
○Regarding the current administrative reforms, four cormorant masters have been assigned to inspect various construction sites under the Public Works Department. As previously ordered, regardless of past precedents, efficiency measures should be established, and when wasteful matters are observed, they should be reported up the chain of command. Workplace matters should also be handled through proper channels. Therefore, regarding the tightening of all affairs, each official should communicate their opinions to the cormorant masters, and workplace matters should also be communicated to each official. Furthermore, thorough consultation should be conducted with the Public Works Magistrate to ensure proper control.

○Recently, His Lordship has been suffering from dizziness and has not been able to attend the castle for quite some time. However, as the time for his return to the domain approaches, he wishes to force himself to attend the castle, but due to heat stroke and severe chills, he is unable to do so. In such circumstances, it is difficult to predict when he will be able to return to the domain, so for the sake of his health, a request was made for hot spring treatment at the seaside in his home province, which has been approved. Therefore, he will return to his domain as usual. This matter has been ordered to be communicated to all for their understanding.

Therefore, respective punishments have been ordered. From now on, group clerks must reform their conduct and serve properly, which should be strictly communicated.

○ For official business, when various officials and their clerks, retainers, etc. go on inspection tours or land surveys, they shall stay at official inns, lodging houses, or at the residences of village headmen and prominent farmers in villages, paying for firewood and rice expenses as a matter of course, and shall not provide anything beyond one soup and one side dish with whatever provisions are available, as has been communicated. Regarding rural areas, in emphasizing official duties, the catering naturally becomes elaborate, with repairs to building damages, procurement of various utensils, and extra expenses for additional needs, which has been reported. Such matters are naturally prohibited, and henceforth, even if various utensils are procured and prepared, this is unnecessary - arrangements should be made simply and modestly according to circumstances. Furthermore, depending on the location, village officials from associated villages and village people involved in official duties stay at lodgings from the previous night or day for convenience, sharing food and drink among themselves, and it is reported that even such expenses are later allocated to village expenses, which is completely improper. The meals of those staying should be arranged more simply through consultation, and these should naturally be their personal miscellaneous expenses. Henceforth, allocating such costs to village expenses is strictly prohibited and should be firmly ordered. If there are those who do not comply with these instructions, they should be reported immediately. Naturally, retainers and clerks should also be instructed accordingly, and arrangements should be made so that village expenses do not increase unnecessarily. The same instructions should be communicated to villages in private domains as well. October

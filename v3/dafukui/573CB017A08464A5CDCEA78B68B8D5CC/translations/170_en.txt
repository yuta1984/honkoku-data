○Regarding commercial goods entering Mikuni from other provinces, until now port wholesalers would contact local merchants for direct purchase negotiations, but trade would fail over small differences, and ships would enter port only to leave empty-handed. Merchant ships naturally stopped entering port, causing economic decline. Therefore, to promote port prosperity, all purchased goods entering port shall be government-purchased at appropriate prices regardless of type and sold to those who desire them. Since storing unsellable goods would result in government losses, all government-purchased goods shall be sold at prices corresponding to each item's going rate. The handling office for this system shall be appointed to the same three ToiMaru as for salt, so they should further consider the attached written chart and report any operational suggestions. As this directive has been issued, the magistrates shall consult and arrange accordingly. Separate document same as above.

1. Tax collection has decreased compared to before, and village conditions have declined from previous times. While this matter is generally attributed to luxurious customs that neglect agriculture, this too must be due to inadequate supervision.

1. District administrators should know that their position is an extremely important official role. Generally, they handle not only tax collection and administrative reforms, but also judicial matters, allocations, allowances, and all manner of official expenses. In this position, they oversee matters of decline, prosperity, and life and death of the common people. Managing these responsibilities is no easy task. Since it is not easy, the application of one's mind cannot be a simple matter either, and if one's mental and physical strength is insufficient despite one's best efforts, there is nothing to be done. Generally, if there are those who, while holding office, do not understand their duties and happen to indulge in pleasure and luxury, or pursue only personal wealth or advancement while neglecting their official duties, please report this immediately. If one applies oneself mentally, one naturally becomes competent. When there are many obstacles and official duties are left entirely to clerks, and with such other negligent attitudes, wasteful expenses are incurred and immediate financial difficulties arise, then financial matters are also left to clerks. When both official duties and financial matters are delegated, even if one realizes the problems, it is now too late to remedy, and there may be those who live day by day in complacency. These are failures due to inadequate mental application. If one truly believes that official administrative territories are extremely important and difficult as described above, such situations should not occur. Those who can support their wives and children through His Lordship's generous favor should, given these times, work with utmost dedication to restore the financial situation. Those who are not moved by this lack sincere hearts. I wonder how those without sincere hearts can handle such difficult official duties. Monkey year, May 4th

Since Lord Etchū-no-kami has issued these instructions, understand their meaning and work especially diligently in official duties. Since these are extremely important official positions, given these instructions, if there are inadequate measures that do not conform to these intentions, it will be necessary to report dismissal from office, so keep this in mind beforehand.

Official Notice
○Regarding the family traditions of retainers of our house through generations, these have been announced previously, so there should be no misunderstandings. First, regarding martial arts, although considerable effort has been made thus far, even greater attention should be paid. The proficiency levels of martial arts being practiced shall be reported by instructors, with names submitted. Furthermore, without paying attention to other matters, observe the way of loyalty and filial piety, and devote yourselves exclusively to martial arts and learning.

1. As instructed previously, observe frugality and avoid wasteful expenditures, especially luxurious practices. However, recently there are reports of some who inappropriately adorn themselves beyond their means due to misunderstanding. In all things, practice economy without luxury or extravagance, wearing simple clothing while performing official duties is of primary importance. While matters outside Edo gates are exceptional, in the home domain, people should wear locally produced items as much as possible, avoiding items from other domains, and in all other matters, make efforts to use primarily locally produced goods. Generally, not limited to clothing, for various tools and equipment, if existing items are not unsightly in appearance, use them without concern. Creating new items for appearance's sake is unnecessary. Regarding residences, proper maintenance is certainly appropriate. However, any ostentatious preferences are unnecessary. Of course, family members should also wear simple clothing and avoid misunderstandings.

1. Regarding inheritance, marriage, and entertainment, keep these modest as previously instructed. Other celebrations should follow the same principle

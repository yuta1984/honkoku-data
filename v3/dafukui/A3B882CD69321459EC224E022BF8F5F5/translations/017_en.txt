1. Regarding irrigation waterways in rural areas: When weirs are built in rivers to divert water, some construct their weirs in ways that cause water shortages for downstream wells, but they proceed only for their own convenience without regard for others, leading to disputes. Or in places where there are intake channels on both banks, when relocating an intake channel on one bank, they do so at the discretion of one side without mutual consultation between both parties, resulting in lawsuits. From now on, regarding such matters, when both sides consult and carry out construction work, they shall attend together to ensure there are no obstructions. If there are delays or illegal acts are committed, judgment shall be rendered to those who file suit within twelve months from that time. If suits are filed after this time limit has passed, they will not be accepted.

1. Regarding disputes over county boundaries, village boundaries, mountains and fields, or matters concerning mortgaged rice fields, and other matters brought to the magistrate's office: Even in unreasonable cases without evidence, people make various excuses and obfuscate the issues. Even in cases where there is evidence, they bring up old matters after years have passed and file lawsuits, causing hardship to the opposing villages, and moreover becoming a source of impoverishment for villages on both sides, which is inexcusable. Therefore, henceforth such types of suits shall not be filed. If such cases are brought forward and upon deliberation their cunning nature becomes apparent, punishment shall be imposed.

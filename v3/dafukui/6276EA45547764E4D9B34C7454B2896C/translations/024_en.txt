when borrowing servants, they may pass through with the borrower's seal.
　　　However, when someone goes out on missions to other domains and leaves servants behind, one person must be designated from among relatives or trusted associates to take responsibility and request passage through the gate. In such cases, permission must be sought from the inspectors. This same rule applies to those who are seriously ill.

1. Regarding clerks and temporary workers, as before, gate passes shall be issued by the supervisor in charge. When sending temporary workers as messengers, unless they are assigned to firefighting duties, this shall be handled as before.

　　　　　Memorandum

1. On days when the lord makes formal processions and passes near the estate, no commoners whatsoever may be allowed through before the procession begins.
　　　However, those on official business to the kitchen shall be an exception. Also, those who claim to have urgent business with the treasury or construction office that cannot be delayed shall be allowed through after confirming their business.

1. After the procession has passed and people enter through the gate thereafter, they shall be told to finish their business early and return home. If they do not leave by seven o'clock in the evening, a report stating how many people still remain at the estate must be made to the inspectors' quarters. In general, care must be taken not to allow too many commoners to enter on such days.

1. When messengers come from elsewhere to the estate or quarters, their destination and master must be confirmed and recorded. For the quarters, it must be recorded whom they are visiting. If such messengers stay long within the estate, inquiry shall be made to the relevant quarters, and if they say the messenger was sent back earlier, this matter must be promptly reported to the inspectors' quarters. However, if they say the messenger is still waiting in the quarters, this shall be accepted as is.

1. Passing commoners who do not regularly come to the estate for business must absolutely not be allowed to enter the gate. Those who come regularly and are recognized may enter. Even if they are sales assistants or servants of those who have been coming to the estate for business for several years, if they are not recognized, they must be thoroughly examined before being allowed through.

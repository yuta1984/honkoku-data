　Previously announced regarding the wearing of clothing bearing the bestowed hollyhock crest: it was ordered that those who bring young attendants should wear such clothing when going outside the gate. Henceforth, it is ordered that when going outside the gate with one servant in proper attendance, such clothing should be worn. Similarly for wives and children, following the same rule, when going out properly with one servant, wearing such clothing is acceptable.
　For all other cases, as previously ordered, items such as tissue pouches, protective pouches, tobacco cases, etc., even if lined, bearing the hollyhock crest, or even fabric scraps with the crest, must not be taken outside the gate.
1. When wearing clothing with the hollyhock crest and going outside the gate, if the one servant brought along suddenly falls ill at the destination and cannot accompany you back, hire someone at that location, report to the mansion, call for a replacement retainer, and return with them in attendance.
　Returning without a servant is strictly forbidden. The above has been ordered, so everyone should understand this intent. The above.

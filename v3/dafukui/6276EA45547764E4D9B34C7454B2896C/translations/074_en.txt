Handling of Official Religious Sect Certificates

Article 1: Every year in October, regarding the official certificates with the joint seals of the senior councilors (karō) for the regular notification to the two Christian magistrates (kirishitan bugyō), when the original document arrives from the domain in early October, the chamberlains (yōnin) shall witness locally, present it before the senior councilors, and have both seals affixed. This shall be brought to the two magistrates after the 20th of October. [This applies to] the senior inspectors (ōmetsuke) and construction magistrates (sakuji-bugyō).

Article 1: When there are unexpected changes among family members such as births, deaths, change of residence, name changes, temple changes, etc., if before July, notification shall be made in July; if after July, notification shall be made in December. However, since these bi-seasonal notifications are without [domain lord's] seal, draft papers are sent from the domain, and the official document is prepared in Edo. For such missions, an inspector (metsuke) shall travel [to deliver them].

Article 1: Gifts shall be sent to the attendants of the two Christian magistrates, each accompanied by a letter:
　For summer greetings: ten bundles of pickled mackerel each　For winter greetings: one jar of sea urchin each (specifically four-gō capacity)

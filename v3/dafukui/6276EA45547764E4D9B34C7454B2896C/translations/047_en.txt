In general, when suspicious persons are captured within intersection guard patrol areas, when there are reports from within the group organization to the inspectors, the established practice has been to send witnesses to report the matter and, upon receiving instructions, hand them over to the town magistrate office. However, when such suspicious persons are captured hereafter, there is no need to report to anyone - they shall be handed over directly to the town magistrate office, as this inquiry has been approved.
The above written matter shall be understood accordingly. That is all.

Article 1: On March 25th, 1st year of Kanpō (1741), during the night lodging of Bishū-no-miya, eight lodging placards from five inns were torn off. When the main lodging reported this and the foot inspectors investigated, the main lodging and the five inn operators had no excuse when the matter was reported for hearing. Since a formal investigation by his lordship's order would be a serious matter, they were ordered to be more careful in the future, and written pledges were obtained from the five inn operators, concluding the matter.

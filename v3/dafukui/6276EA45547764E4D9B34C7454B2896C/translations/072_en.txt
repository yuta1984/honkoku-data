Regarding the Lord's Official Visits (Onari)

[Note in red] First proclaimed in the second month of Enkyō 1 (1744), the text at that time is as written in red - Records of Various Matters in the Domain

Article 1: Regarding official visits, although instructions have been given previously, this time they are being proclaimed anew: When the lord passes in front of the gate, strict orders must be given to all those residing in the official residences, from high to low ranking retainers. Particularly, those on the second floor must be moved downstairs, kept away from the front windows and gathered toward the rear areas. Naturally, idle conversation is absolutely forbidden, and the household head must give strict orders about this. When the household head is absent, the person in charge must be strictly instructed to exercise proper caution without negligence. When orders are given regarding smoke control, this goes without saying - even after nightfall, there must be absolutely no lighting of fires.

Article 1: Regarding the front official residences, it goes without saying, but even in the inner official residences, when the lord passes by, one must not speak loudly or engage in conversation. When moving about within the mansion grounds, and furthermore when going out for guard duty, companions must never come and go. Even when wearing zōri (sandals) or during rainy weather, since footsteps can be loud within the official residences, wearing footwear is absolutely forbidden, and even when it must be worn, great care should be taken.

The above instructions have been given previously, but they are being proclaimed anew this time, so their meaning should be understood and strict orders given to all subordinates. The above.

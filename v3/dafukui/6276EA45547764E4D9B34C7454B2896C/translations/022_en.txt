Reiganjima Middle Gate
Gate Post Regulations

1. Gate guards must pay careful attention to the comings and goings of all persons, high and low, ensuring that no one without proper identification slips through by recording them on the hand-board, and must absolutely not allow any suspicious persons to enter. If there are any persons of unusual appearance, this must be reported immediately to the inspectors.

1. Gate guards who conduct identification checks, needless to say, and all other personnel as well, must regularly familiarize themselves with official seals and ensure proper inspection so that no counterfeit passes or suspicious persons get through.

1. When honored guests pass through, guards must go ahead and have the lower-ranking people clear the way, ensuring no discourtesy is committed. Particularly when hatamoto are making inspection rounds to the retainers' quarters, guards must go ahead to guide them and ensure no discourtesy from the lower ranks.

1. Apart from official messengers of the samurai class, private outings after the evening sixth hour are not permitted. Should there naturally be unavoidable urgent business requiring departure, this must be reported to the master of ceremonies and passage allowed according to their instructions. In such cases, the inspectors must notify the gate before allowing passage through the gate.
　　　Addendum: The same applies to ashigaru and lower-ranking officials

1. Pages may pass through with permission from the page inspector. It is exceptional for those without forelocks to go out as messengers. However, when not going out as official messengers without borrowed horses being provided, they must receive permission from an inspector to pass through.

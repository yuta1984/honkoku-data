The members of the second unit going out should also avoid acting carelessly.

1. When a fire occurs and the advance firefighters and second unit depart, the mounted attendants should dismount sequentially near the Black Gate and enter within the Black Gate. To avoid congestion, horses should be tethered sequentially toward the mountain side, using the dismounting post within the Black Gate as the boundary. This applies to nighttime as well.

1. When encountering members of the lord's family on the road, one may pass without formal bowing. Prior permission has already been granted. When the personnel are withdrawing, one should dismount and pass, but formal bowing is not required.

1. When encountering government officials and assisting firefighters on the road, clear the way and pass; dismounting is not required.

1. When encountering Senior or Junior Councilors on the road, dismount and pass, but formal bowing is not required. However, when rushing to an urgent fire, even if encountering Senior or Junior Councilors or the Three Branch Houses, clear the way and pass without formal bowing.

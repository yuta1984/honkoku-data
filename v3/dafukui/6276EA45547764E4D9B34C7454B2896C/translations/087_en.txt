This is acknowledged and will be communicated to the domain supervisory heads, but henceforth in the home domain as well, the relatives of said person should petition the supervisory heads regarding to whom they wish to send someone as an adopted child in this locality. Moreover, when reported here (in Edo) as well, those who petition from both sides will have their requests acknowledged.

Since the above matter should be communicated, it should be strictly ordered to retainers so they understand this intent.

　　　　January 11th　　　　　　　　Inspectors
　　In addition, those with group supervisory duties should communicate the above intent

The above is a circular of the official notice issued in the spring of Hōreki 9 (1759), year of the Rabbit, for everyone's reference

1. As announced annually, the salaries of servants, tool-bearers, and horse-handlers should not exceed 2 ryō and 1 bu as has been decreed, so you should fully understand this intent and employ them with salaries reduced accordingly

1. In recent years, servants' salaries have gradually become expensive, which causes hardship for the samurai class, so official notices have been issued repeatedly. However, it is heard that some people indulge in luxury and secretly add goods to salaries when employing servants, which is improper. Therefore, from now on investigations will be conducted, so you should inquire about the salary amount at the servant's former master,

inform the former master of this matter, make slight adjustments up or down, and then employ them. If a servant falsifies their salary or shows other selfish behavior, this should be promptly reported to the inspectors. Strict investigation will be conducted. However, employing retainers for many years and providing allowances is a separate matter.
The above
　　　　January 11th　　　　　　　　Inspectors
　　　　　　　　To all

1. When servants are in short supply or when employing retainers midway through service, and you call people from outside the gate from the domain territory to employ them, the master should report this matter to the inspectors, and permission should be sought annually to send them outside the gate during the February personnel changes. Those employed without negligence are strictly not sent outside the gate.

1. When retainers are improper or when dismissed unexpectedly due to displeasure, the master should provide the prescribed travel money and send them to the home domain, so this matter should be understood. Since there have been cases of non-compliance with this [unclear text] from before, this is announced once again. The above

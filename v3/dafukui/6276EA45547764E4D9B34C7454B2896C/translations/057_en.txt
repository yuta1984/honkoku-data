1. For visits to Ueno and Zōjōji temples and official shrine mausoleums: same as above, the entourage inside shall serve from Niten Gate inward, following the same protocol as the entourage inside Ōte San-no-mon dismounting area. The same applies for visits to Shōgon-in shrine and Ueno mausoleums in the home domain.

　However, preliminary worship duties are performed every year on April 17th.

1. For visits to the mausoleum of Lady Shinnkan-in at Ueno during memorial services: same protocol as entourage inside the dismounting area.
　However, regarding the ladies' mausoleums, though it would normally be difficult to accomplish, since previously at Hitotsubashi formal castle visits to the inner palace were made and audiences were granted, visits are now made. Starting from the immediate memorial service in the 9th month of Meiwa 8 (1771), visits are made for each anniversary.

When visiting clan relatives or others, whether for courtesy calls or brief visits, if there are greetings from advance intermediaries until formal greetings, and if told to enter reception rooms for rest, this shall also be communicated to foot inspectors and conveyed throughout.

　However, in Anei 6 (1777) at Ogawamachi, due to a fire involving Ochanomai fire brigade chief Lord Matsudaira Kurōnosuke, when he dispatched horses, Lord Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami was encountered, passed between the advance entourage, arrived from behind, and withdrew Lord Kurōnosuke, causing various disputes. If there should be any misunderstanding among the entourage in such situations, considering what might be thought, fortunately Lord Ishikawa Tosa-no-kami, who supervises the small stipend groups and came to the residence, was privately consulted. When inquiring with inspection officers Lord Ōshima Hyōgo and Lord Sengoku Yahyōe, who previously served as regular fire brigade officers, it was reported that even during official visits, they pass between entourage members, and moreover, even with the Three Houses and Three Lords, they do not dismount but conduct greetings while mounted and pass through.

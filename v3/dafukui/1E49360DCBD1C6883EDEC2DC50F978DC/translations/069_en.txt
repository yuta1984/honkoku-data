　　　　　　　1. There must be no quarrels with people from other places. If you
　　　　　　　　start trouble, punishment will be applied to both you and your followers. Even if the other party
　　　　　　　　starts trouble, if you lose, the same punishment will be applied

　　　　　　　　without informing Izu-no-kami and Gonnosuke. Even if there are those who
　　　　　　　　naturally come to visit, you must not receive them without consulting these two men

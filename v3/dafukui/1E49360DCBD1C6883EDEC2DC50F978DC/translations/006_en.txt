　　　　He was granted an audience with Shingun (Tokugawa Ieyasu), and at that time, by the lord's will, he was given Katsukata (a concubine of Shingun, adopted daughter of Ōta Shinrokurō Yasusuke, actually the daughter of Kageyama Nagato-no-kami Ujitora) as his ward, and after they became husband and wife, he proceeded to Edo. Since Honda Sado-no-kami Masanobu was in Sunpu at this time, the matter of accompanying [Toramatsu] was entrusted to Lord Sado-no-kami.

　Keichō 5, Year of the Metal Rat (1600)
　　一　On a certain day of a certain month
　　　　When Lord Toramatsu was staying at the hostage residence within Osaka Castle, due to the treacherous schemes of Ishida Jibu-shōyū (Mitsunari) that led to disturbances in the Osaka area, Lord Hideyasu sent Toda Rokubei from his military camp at Oyama in Shimotsuke Province with secret instructions to Osaka. Consequently, Sakakibara Rokuuemon, who was in attendance, used stratagem to move Lord Toramatsu to a residence outside the castle.

○Due to the critical financial difficulties, in the previous Year of the Monkey, it was ordered that retainers with 200 koku or more should have half-reduction borrowed rice for three years, and those under 200 koku for one year. This was paid without delay, to His Lordship's satisfaction. Although the retainers' circumstances of hardship cause concern, given the long-standing financial difficulties, it cannot be as wished, so from the fifth year, borrowed rice at the same rate as until the previous Year of the Sheep is ordered for all.

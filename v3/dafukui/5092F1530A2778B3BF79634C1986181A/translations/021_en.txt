1. When people from rural areas come to the castle town, and naturally even in their home villages, women shall not use blue umbrellas, geta or zōri with decorative woven fabric attachments. Male children shall use nothing other than straw sandals.

1. When village headmen, village officials, and leading figures come to the castle town on official business, recently some have been staying at restaurants or fish shops, engaging in extremely extravagant behavior. All such activities become village expenses and cause hardship for small farmers. Therefore, henceforth those who come to the castle town shall stay at inn operators' establishments paying only basic wood money rates. Those from nearby areas should return home the same day whenever possible.

1. When there are disputes or complaints in village matters, under the mediator's direction, people sometimes travel to the castle town, Fuchū, Mikuni, Kanazu, etc., to make arrangements. Such practices shall be strictly prohibited. Henceforth, consultations shall be held at the mediator's residence. When people from related villages must travel long distances unavoidably and this causes delays, they shall stay at the mediator's house or in that village.

1. Regarding marriages of peasants in the domain: marriage alliances with people from main domain, entrusted territories, and other domains ultimately lead to extravagance, so henceforth marriages with people from such territories are strictly prohibited.

1. When officials go to rural areas, they shall be provided for with town stipend rice, with only tea served, and there shall be no contributions from villages.

1. Regarding the deputy governors and others assigned to rural duties: it has been ordered that there be no expenses in rural areas, and even labor assignments should be reduced.

1. Methods shall be established and communicated to prevent the increase of four-district corvée labor.

1. For river maintenance and road-bridge construction: with careful consideration, cost-cutting methods shall be established and communicated.

1. Regarding rural visits by district magistrates and others: although this has been customary, when there are no sincere visits and deployment of construction supervisors, there should be ways to exercise restraint.

1. Besides the above articles, after examination, additional cost-cutting measures will be ordered, but further restraint should be exercised and communicated at the offices as well.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Chief Administrators
○This year, we have heard that rice prices in other provinces have become high. Although strict orders were issued in the previous year of the Monkey regarding control measures, and these should be observed, we hereby issue even more strict control orders to prevent rice and grain from leaking to other provinces. Ensure there are no misunderstandings when conveying this.
1. Regarding rapeseed export to other provinces, due to this directive, a new additional role tax has been ordered for this year, so strict control measures should be taken to prevent unauthorized exports through ports. If there are those who violate these rules and someone reports those conducting unauthorized port exports, the rapeseed will be confiscated and the informant will be given a reward.
   The above should be communicated to subordinates accordingly.

However, these local offices have been discontinued, and all official business handling should be conducted as originally understood.
   This directive should be communicated to the deputies.

○Just now from the head regarding advance selling and buying of new rice, etc. - same as last year
○Regarding high rice prices, etc. - although sake brewing rice purchases are suspended, etc. - same as last year
　　　　　August 5th　Also to Fuchu
○Sake brewing was suspended last year due to poor harvest, but this autumn's harvest appears good, and with a truly abundant harvest, once the rice storage in various official granaries is secured, one-third sake brewing will be permitted. However, at that time, the base rice will be provided officially, so purchasing sake brewing rice privately is strictly forbidden. If there are any violators, they will be investigated and severely punished.

were also issued, but recently there are reports of negligence, which is unacceptable. Therefore, personnel from each unit should be assigned, and inspections should be conducted for handling coastal control measures so that strict controls can be implemented. Furthermore, salt merchants in Fukui town and salt brokers at Mikuni Port should establish annual rotations for salt smuggling inspections, and if any irregularities are found, they should be strictly investigated and reported internally to the administrative heads and the Mikuni Salt Office. Understanding this directive, each should exercise careful attention

○Due to continuing financial difficulties, year after year both retainers and townspeople and rural residents have fallen into hardship, which causes distress. However, if this situation is left unaddressed, it will not suffice, and after succession, future generations will be unable to perform any service, and if there are appointments in the near future that cannot be fulfilled, it would be truly inexcusable. Moreover, supporting retainers and nurturing the people becomes difficult, causing heartache. Originally, with low revenues, managing the balance of principal and interest is not easy, but emergency preparations are essential. Therefore, this time above all else, reforms will be made, and for the next five years, special frugality will be implemented to establish sustainable practices. The retainers should understand this directive. Ultimately, this is solely for considering the foundation of prosperity for all classes and future generations. Of course, frugality should not be used as an excuse to neglect the ways of civil and military arts. This year, being the first year of implementation, I wish to provide various forms of support, but given the above circumstances, this is not possible. Further details will be communicated by the senior retainers. The above
　　　　　Intercalary 6th month
○This time, with special consideration, orders for frugality and tightening have been issued, and a copy of His Lordship's own handwriting is hereby provided. Furthermore, in recent years, borrowed rice has been repeatedly ordered for retainers, which is regrettable, and various measures for assistance have been deliberated. However, as everyone knows, due to recent increasing expenses, desires cannot be fulfilled, but with His Lordship's consideration, loan certificates will be issued to those in financial difficulty. Those wishing to borrow should consult with the magistrates

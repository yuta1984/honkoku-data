　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Head of Administration

○This year, in connection with the lord's entry into the domain, by special consideration, a decree has been issued to exempt the half-reduction. However, since the land conditions are poor and the financial situation is excessive, it has been ordered that even more sincere care should be taken for the management of domain finances.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Magistrate

○This year, with the lord's entry into the domain, by special consideration, the half-reduction for retainers has been exempted from this year, and an eight-bu rice loan has been decreed. However, since the land conditions are poor and the financial situation is excessive, as decreed since the year before last (Year of the Monkey), all administrative offices should exercise careful judgment regarding cost-cutting measures, even in small matters, for the benefit and advantage of the domain, and work diligently. Of course, starting with the finance officials, everyone should be told to work even harder.

If there are those who set false prices, they too should be investigated and punished.
Keep this matter firmly in mind, conduct all commercial activities through proper channels, and work diligently for the public good. This should be announced to everyone in the town, including temple and shrine precincts and tenant farmers.

○Regarding the matter of Ishitani mountain surveying and stone carving measurements: As proclaimed last December, the export to other provinces should be strictly observed according to ancient law. As for export to other territories, special permission has been granted for a period of ten years under exceptional circumstances, so the Public Works Office should conduct thorough examination and handle [such matters].
　The above should be communicated to the Public Works Magistrate.

Therefore, first, without an increase in tax collection (goshunou-kata), the financial reform (goshuhou) would be difficult to implement. However, since it is unreasonable to order tax increases without justification, it has been ordered that various rural expenses be reduced to enable increased collection. The deputy governors should work diligently on this matter. The handling methods are as follows:

1. All routine inspections conducted thus far shall be suspended. When severely barren or abandoned lands appear, inspections shall be conducted only after thorough examination. Details shall be handled after examination at the Administrative Office.

1. Since crop inspections are suspended this year, internal inspections by the deputy governors shall also be suspended.
　　However, when crop inspections are ordered, magistrates and others during their rounds shall conduct them on foot. For magistrates and district magistrates, deputy governors shall ensure there are no village contributions.

1. For emergency inspections, people shall bring packed lunches and return the same day whenever possible. Regarding overnight stays, follow the regulations for crop inspections.

1. When deputy governors make their rounds, all the above applies equally.

1. District administration, mountain administration, irrigation administration, river maintenance administration, falconry administration, etc.—all official visits to rural areas shall be reduced as much as possible. Labor assignments, lodging, and meals shall be handled according to previous articles, as ordered to each respective office. Four-district corvée labor shall also be reduced through examination.

1. Regarding peasants' way of life and all matters: since extravagant behaviors have been reported, comprehensive administrative control has been ordered to district magistrates.

1. According to the above orders: stipend rice distributions, allowances, and loans shall all be suspended from this year during the designated period.
　　However, cases that cannot be suspended for unavoidable reasons shall be handled after thorough examination at the Accounting Office.

1. Although crop inspections are suspended this year, tax assessment meetings shall be established and determined.

1. Regarding visits to officials before and after crop inspections and emergency deployments, particularly village headmen, official agents, and village officials coming to pay respects: although this has been repeatedly announced, some misunderstand. Henceforth, such visits are strictly prohibited. If anyone misunderstands, they will be detained at their place of registration and severely punished, so this shall be ordered.

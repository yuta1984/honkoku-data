　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Administrative Head
○This spring, orders were issued regarding frugality enforcement in towns and villages, but reports of misunderstanding have been heard, so the attached document has been proclaimed. Anyone who continues to misunderstand will unavoidably face strict judgment, which would result in an unfortunate situation and be presumptuous. Moreover, since notifications were sent to Honpo administrative districts and others this spring, it is unacceptable that the situation has shifted toward negligence. Furthermore, regarding enforcement matters, strict investigation should be conducted in consultation with the inspectors
　　　　　　Attached Document
○This spring, with special compassion, orders were issued regarding frugality enforcement in towns and villages, but recently reports of relaxation have been heard. If such developments continue, it would ultimately mean forgetting the domain's benevolence, which is extremely inappropriate. Therefore, henceforth, anyone who misunderstands shall be arrested, thoroughly investigated, and face strict judgment according to their circumstances. This should be understood accordingly

1. Regarding silkworm seeds, a management system was established in the year before last (Year of the Boar), but was discontinued at the end of that year according to official policy. However, since inferior seeds have been mixed in and sold widely, causing distress to those engaged in silkworm raising, the aforementioned individuals have petitioned to establish a management system with the above witnesses, conduct sincere inspections, improve the seeds to high quality, reduce prices, and spread them throughout the domain. As a trial, this petition has been approved.

1. Vendors selling silkworms in rural areas shall be placed under the control of the aforementioned administrators. Those who have made this their livelihood until now shall receive strict regulatory instructions and be given identification tags to circulate to their previous locations.

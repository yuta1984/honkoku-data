　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chamberlain
○ Regarding the reforms and frugality measures, as previously announced, by all means a system of controlling expenditures according to income must be established, and all matters are being investigated. Accordingly, regarding Edo affairs, although His Lordship's finances and others are in difficult circumstances, by his will the close attendants and others have been ordered to reduce their numbers. All departments are similarly reducing personnel gradually. Even though we have been short-staffed until now, this makes things even more difficult, but for His Lordship's sake, regardless of regular duty assignments, even if taking on duties in different departments concurrently, without being bound by precedent, matters that come to mind should be reported with sincerity and diligence. This should be understood accordingly.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To District Heads and Deputy Administrators

Since rice prices are particularly high this year, anyone who violates these rules will be severely punished. Issue this directive accordingly.
　　　　　Separate document
○Due to high rice prices, the purchase of rice for sake brewing is temporarily suspended. Anyone who violates this will be severely punished. Issue this directive accordingly.
　　　　　Eighth month, eleventh day　Also to Fuchū
　The above is recorded because this year's high rice prices require different wording than the standard format.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To District Heads
○Previously, the export of rice, miscellaneous grains, and sake to other domains from both towns and countryside was prohibited. Accordingly, all checkpoints and harbor outposts must maintain even stricter controls over all matters both by sea and land.
First, regarding sake breweries and rice purchasing, these are also prohibited, but since irregular warehouse inspections may occur, maintain even stricter vigilance.
　Anyone who violates these directives will be investigated and punished, including not only the perpetrator but also local officials. If such activities are observed, report them immediately and privately. Even those who are not village headmen or officials should conduct proper investigations without negligence. Anyone who knowingly fails to report violations will be strictly punished.
　Communicate the above to all subordinates immediately.
　　　　　Eighth month, twenty-fifth day　Also to Fuchū
○Regarding the export of rice, miscellaneous grains, and sake from towns and countryside to other domains, strict controls were previously ordered, but since rice prices are now even higher, station additional personnel at harbor outposts and implement even stricter controls.
　　　　　Ninth month, twenty-fifth day　Four District Magistrates　Fuchū (eighth month)　Towns (eighth month)
○Although strict orders have been repeatedly issued regarding controls on exports of rice, miscellaneous grains, and sake to other domains, if anyone still violates these rules and is discovered secretly exporting these goods, the items will be confiscated and given to the informant. This should encourage mutual vigilance without negligence. Anyone who knowingly fails to report such activities will be strictly punished.

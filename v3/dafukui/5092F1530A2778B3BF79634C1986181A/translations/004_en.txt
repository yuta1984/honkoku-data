○This year being a succession year, and particularly as it coincides with the scheduled leave period, [the young lord] earnestly wishes to make his domain entry, and has already submitted internal petitions to that effect. However, since he is under seventeen years of age, there are official government regulations, and the formal petition has been deferred. Therefore, regrettably, this year he will unavoidably remain in Edo residence. First and foremost, domain administration is of paramount importance, so [you] must faithfully observe the established laws and serve with utmost dedication. This message is to be conveyed.
                    March 29th    To all those with administrative responsibilities, down to the lowest ranks

1. The sale of unsigned hosho paper has been prohibited from long ago, but recently laxness has been reported. Furthermore, some have been handling [such paper] under the mistaken belief that hosho paper is acceptable even without official seals when produced in villages other than the five designated papermaking villages. This has been roughly reported and is improper conduct. Therefore, this should be subject to strict official censure, but this time it will be pardoned. Henceforth, not only the paper merchants of the castle town but also those in the four districts and rural areas shall establish control measures. Even paper merchants from other places and domains, if found handling unsigned hosho paper, shall be secretly investigated regarding the circumstances, and if it appears to be contraband paper, its source shall be reported without hesitation.
    However, if any paper merchants within the domain territory are found handling unsigned hosho paper, the paper shall be confiscated and strict punishment shall be imposed.
1. Regarding the Fukui paper merchants, they shall strictly observe the laws as established when stock certificates were determined and joint pledge documents were submitted in previous years.
1. Regarding rural paper merchants, their numbers shall be determined this time and stock certificates shall be distributed.
    Additionally, if anyone other than current paper merchants later petitions [for permission], it shall be granted after examination at that time.
1. Among the Fukui paper wholesalers, annual administrators shall be appointed and charged with examining unsigned hosho paper. After stock certificates are determined, all matters concerning paper merchant operations, starting with various petitions, shall be communicated to the Fukui annual administrators.
The above has been ordered, so it shall be announced without omission.

○Regarding the sale of unsigned hosho paper, as mentioned above... since some have been handling [such paper] under the mistaken belief that unsigned [paper] is acceptable, punishments were imposed respectively in previous years, but recently there are again those selling unsigned hosho paper, which is improper conduct. Therefore, strict official censure should be imposed, but this time clemency has been granted, so henceforth the laws must be strictly observed. Furthermore, this time for control purposes, inspectors have been appointed among the Fukui paper merchants...

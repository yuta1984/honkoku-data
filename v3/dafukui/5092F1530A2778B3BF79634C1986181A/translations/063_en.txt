Tenpō 5 (1834)

To the District Heads
○Since various reforms were ordered in the previous Year of the Ox (Tenpō 4), domestic products should be used exclusively. However, recently merchants bringing products from other domains—including textiles, fabrics, sundries, and various other goods—have been steadily increasing. It is reported that even those outside their proper occupations are colluding to act as intermediaries in these transactions, which is extremely improper conduct. Especially in these times of high grain prices, such trading activities and even a single night's lodging within our domain territory must not be permitted. If there are any violators, strict punishment will certainly be imposed.
All must strictly observe these instructions, and the district heads shall give careful attention to enforcing compliance.
　　　　January 25th　Also to Fuchu

To the District Heads
○Regarding compensation for stolen goods, there were previous directives, but it is reported that practices have since become inconsistent. Henceforth, regardless of whether thieves have fixed residences or are vagrants, handle matters according to the directives issued in Bunsei 8, the year before last.
　　　　February 5th　Handle appropriately as stated above
　However, also from the Inspector to Fuchu

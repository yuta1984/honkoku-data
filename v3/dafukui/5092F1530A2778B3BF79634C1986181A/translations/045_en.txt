○ The year before last, the Reigan Island residence suffered fire damage, and due to increased expenses for reconstruction and all other matters, the household finances became strained. From that same year, half-reduction borrowed rice was ordered for all retainers, and everyone has maintained frugality, which is considered most admirable. However, despite various concerns and orders given to officials for sincere reform through new policies, expenses in the domain and Edo continue to increase significantly compared to ancient times, and there are unavoidable expenditures including borrowed funds and public money. Without establishing extraordinarily strict laws, it will be difficult to quickly move to a stage of recovery. Therefore, if anyone has ideas beneficial to the domain, regardless of their stipend rank, they should report them without concealment to us.

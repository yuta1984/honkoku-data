Tenpō 6, Year of the Sheep (1835)

○To the Magistrates
We have heard that river embankment construction silver has been excessively spent in recent years and has become costly. Therefore, this time a special financial method has been established, making these expenditures payable in interest-free annual installments, and from this Year of the Sheep, construction silver shall be paid out in silver as needed. Keep this in mind and examine construction methods without being bound by past practices.

As announced above, further consult thoroughly with the river embankment magistrates regarding implementation matters, and if there are any ideas, report them accordingly.
First month, 25th day

○To the Monthly Duty Officers
On the 16th, there was a summons from the magistrate's substitute, Lord Ōkubo Kaga-no-kami, to the information officers, and an official letter from the joint senior councilors arrived. Repair work for Kunō Shrine and others, as well as Daijuji Temple, Shōōji Temple, Hōraiji Temple, Takiyama Shrine, and mausoleums in Sanshū province has been ordered. Furthermore, this time, by special consideration, the service is to be performed with ease according to one's means. This matter is to be communicated.
Third month, 25th day

○To the District Heads
Regarding the assistance duty that has been ordered this time, given that finances have been consistently difficult and strained, the payment of tribute money is causing great concern. Although each district has been impoverished recently, since this is national service, there is no alternative but to request the service money as written. Make every effort to arrange everything completely.

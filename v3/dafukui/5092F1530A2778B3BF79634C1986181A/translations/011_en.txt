○Regarding financial affairs (household finances), while there have been ongoing difficulties, recently the situation has reached critical hardship, which has come to His Lordship's attention, causing him great distress. Therefore, extraordinary measures have been established, and it has been decreed in His Lordship's own handwriting that economies and forbearance should be exercised, beginning with his own household. This is truly gracious and humbling. Regarding this matter, concerning the reforms and frugality measures decreed last year, there should be no negligence, but even greater attention should be paid to all matters, with strict control of all government offices being essential, and careful consideration should be given to sustainable practices. Minor matters should be investigated as circumstances arise.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Magistrates
1. The term of His Lordship's intentions is decreed to be five years
1. This time the intentions are particularly different from before, so understanding this thoroughly, even those in minor official positions should not hesitate to make suggestions, and if they believe something would benefit His Lordship, regardless of scale, they should consult with the magistrates. If there are ideas regarding official duties, even small matters should be reported, and such dedication will be commended
1. While His Lordship's household matters have been specially decreed, subordinate matters should be handled with even greater unity in discussing reductions. If there are oversights, not only colleagues but also those in other positions should offer advice. If there are any misconduct, this should be reported accordingly, and disciplinary action will be taken at that time
1. Among colleagues, there may be those who are naturally reserved, or junior members who have opinions but find it difficult to speak up to senior members. This is not the time for such concerns. Without regard to personal status or position, one must serve with full dedication, as this is the most important service to His Lordship

1. Those serving in the accounting office, down to all subordinate clerks, should serve with dedication to public service above all else, without private interests. If there are those with intentions of offering bribes to superiors, strict investigation will be conducted. Those who handle excessive bribes undoubtedly have private motives, so after investigation, those who are loyal and diligent will be commended. Everyone down to the lowest ranks should carefully attend to calculations and records without negligence, and extravagance should be prohibited. If there are those who misunderstand their duties, strict disciplinary action will be taken

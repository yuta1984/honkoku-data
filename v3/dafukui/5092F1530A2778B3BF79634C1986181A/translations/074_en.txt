The above directives are being reissued, so implement them strictly.

○Regarding this year's crop conditions, sake brewing was previously prohibited, but we have heard that some people in villages have been secretly purchasing rice for sake brewing, expecting that permission might gradually be granted. This is extremely improper. Since rice prices are exceptionally high at present, even common people appear to be facing immediate food shortages. Such arrangements would naturally cause the impoverished to fall into destitution. In essence, those wealthy enough to brew sake are showing poor judgment by not understanding the current circumstances.
　Therefore, private transactions are strictly prohibited. When sake brewing permission is eventually granted, the government will distribute rice from above. Those who have secretly purchased rice for brewing must immediately cancel their transactions. Although these directives have been repeatedly issued, anyone who violates them in the future will be banished along with their trading partners, and their property will be confiscated. Communicate this to all subordinates.
○Since rice prices are unprecedentedly high and the poor are on the verge of starvation, if grain continues to flow to other domains and countries, prices will become even higher and cause greater hardship. Therefore, maintain strict controls as previously ordered. Anyone who fails to understand this and violates these rules will unavoidably face the death penalty along with their trading partners. Make this known to all. Furthermore, anyone who reports violations will receive all the confiscated rice bags and an immediate reward of five silver pieces.

First, while those coming from Kyoto, Osaka, and other domains on official business are exceptions, outsiders entering the castle town for private or commercial purposes must not stay longer than one night. Anyone who allows them to stay two nights will be imprisoned and fined.
　　However, if someone stays one night in the castle town and then changes lodgings for another night without proper investigation, the same punishment applies.
　　First, if anyone who is not a professional innkeeper secretly provides lodging to outsiders, the same punishment applies.
　　The above is issued with special emphasis because this year our domain suffered crop failure and high rice prices, causing hardship for the common people. Ensure there are no violations of these rules.

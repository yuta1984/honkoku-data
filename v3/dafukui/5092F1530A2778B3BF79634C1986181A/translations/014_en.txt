○Regarding rural areas, we hear that poverty increases yearly and among the peasants some are gradually falling into destitution, which is viewed with concern. Originally, they should manage their livelihoods with the surplus after tax payments according to good and bad harvests, but without considering what their farming yields, they have gradually grown extravagant in clothing, food, and housing, making their livelihoods difficult to maintain. Although frugality laws have been issued repeatedly from before, these have slackened over the years, so this time with special compassion, strict adherence to restraint is ordered as per the attached document. This is so that the peasants' livelihoods do not fall into ruin but can be sustained, so it is essential that they understand correctly and diligently pursue their primary occupation of farming without neglect. Especially, head peasants should constantly take care to provide guidance so that small peasants can maintain their livelihoods. Furthermore, they must strictly observe the regulations previously issued.
　　　　　　　　Attached Document
1. In all matters, domain products should be used as much as possible. Particularly regarding clothing that appears inappropriate, even women must use only cotton cloth and nothing else. Using wooden clogs and parasols when going to the castle town shows misunderstanding. Also, celebrations and Buddhist ceremonies should be conducted as simply as possible.
1. While it goes without saying that existing houses should be repaired to prevent damage, new construction and luxurious building projects are strictly forbidden.

　　　However, when it becomes unavoidable to change from earthen floors to wooden flooring, this must be reported to the authorities and follow their instructions.
1. While village officials going out on official business is acceptable, they must not freely enter and exit the private residences of their supervising officials.
　　　However, gifts from village officials to their supervisors are strictly forbidden.
1. Peasants should not freely request permission to work in other domains.
1. In recent years, there are many peasant children, or those who are sickly and unable to perform agricultural work, who increasingly wish to engage in small commerce. Originally, commerce in villages is not appropriate, so they should make their living through agriculture or handicrafts as much as possible.
1. Regarding shrine families and temples, while ceremonial robes and priestly vestments are exceptions, in all other matters they should conform to the regulations issued for towns and villages.
　　　　　　February 29th　Also to Fuchu　　　　To the Town Magistrate
○Since frugality and restraint have been ordered for towns and villages this time, those wearing inappropriate clothing will be questioned and investigated by patrol inspectors even on the roads. Since people from Honpo territories, custody areas, Ono, Katsuyama, Maruoka, Sabae, and all other domains come to Fukui, if they encounter these patrols, there may be questioning and violations of misunderstanding, so this should be understood in advance and notification should be made to Honpo headquarters and others.

【Attached Note】
On October 15th of Bunsei 13 (Year of the Rat), the above main text was issued as ordered, whereupon a petition was submitted by the domain physicians. The content concerned Kurisaki Ryōshuku, who on February 7th of Tenpō 3 (Year of the Dragon), due to his lack of dedication to medical practice, had his family succession of ten-person stipend granted after investigation. The details were that while Ryōshuku was staying at his family home, he would go to training schools or engage in hunting and such activities, showing no dedication to medical practice, which led to the aforementioned order being issued, but due to improper conduct, a reduction in stipend was ordered. However, the head physician and others submitted a collective petition, stating that if this petition was not accepted, all domain physicians would submit resignation requests. Given the gravity of this matter, it was properly reported to the senior councilors, and after thorough deliberation, the following was ordered:

Tenpō 3, Year of the Dragon, June 7th
　If there are no improprieties regarding the parent or heir, the matter of succession shall be decided according to investigation following previous precedents, and furthermore, if there are instances of poor dedication to one's profession or misunderstandings, punishment shall be more severe than previous reprimands, as per the internal directive.

This message was attached as a supplementary note to the petition and delivered, so Yamada Keijun was invited to Yokota Sakutayū's residence to convey this information.

○Regarding the fire watch duty that has been ordered this time, due to continued recent price increases and ever-increasing various expenses causing financial difficulties for the domain treasury, from next spring 50 koku will be borrowed from your three-season stipends.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Town Magistrate
○Due to continued prison escapes in recent years, strict orders were given regarding prison security at that time, but within just a few years there has been another prison escape. Originally, out of special compassionate consideration in previous years, double prisons were ordered, but even this has proven ineffective, which is most regrettable. This ultimately shows that proper understanding has not been achieved, and such negligence is the height of misconduct. Henceforth, the regulations and rules from before must be strictly observed, and there must be no negligence whatsoever. This must be strictly ordered to all officials from the yoriki down to the lowest ranks.

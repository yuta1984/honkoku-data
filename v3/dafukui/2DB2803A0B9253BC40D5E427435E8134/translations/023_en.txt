The southern part of the sea about three ri into this harbor is called "Superior Lake," and the north is called "Safe Haven." Between them, spanning about fifteen chō over the water, there are two large bridges. There is one island in the middle, and from the island the northern bridge is about five chō long, while the southern bridge is about seven chō long. At one location on these bridges there is a drawbridge mechanism that can be raised, making it convenient for large ships to pass through. However, most traffic entering beyond the bridges consists of small boats, while large ships from all nations anchor outside the bridges. The bridge girders are straight with no curve. The supports are built up with stone foundations. Horse-drawn carriages travel back and forth incessantly. At the northern harbor entrance there is a battery with cannons strictly positioned. Stone fortifications appear to be built in layers. Besides this, I saw nothing resembling Japanese castles. I did not see a single person wearing swords. However, during military exercises they attach something like a short sword to their waists. Guns are fired frequently even in peacetime. Small firearms all use flintlock mechanisms, and most large cannons are also mounted on carriages

For over a hundred years since then there have been no major battles, and this is their commemorative custom.

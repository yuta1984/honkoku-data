As they were crossing to China for trade, Manjiro immediately went out and requested passage on a ship. When they agreed, Manjiro used the money he had brought from America to purchase a small boat, thinking that when they reached near Japan, they could row ashore with it. They loaded their tools and the three men boarded. They soon set sail heading west, and in the first month of the following year of the Boar, they arrived about three ri offshore of Ryukyu. They immediately lowered the small boat, and the three transferred to it and rowed toward land. It appeared to be Osaka port according to their map guidance, so they intended to land directly from here. Initially, when Manjiro departed from Honolulu, he sent a letter to Fitchell in North America as a courtesy, expressing his gratitude for the long-term care he had received, asking him to distribute his tools among friends, and also sent a farewell letter to Fitchell's daughter. Here too he wrote another letter and consulted with the ship's master Funotsumowa,

asking him to send it to an American named Limiseuel who was in Honolulu, informing him that all three had safely reached Ryukyu and would soon be able to return to their homeland, and requesting that he tell Toraemon about this and encourage him to return to Japan by convenient ship. Fitscaha also shed tears as they parted, watched the three row to shore and land elsewhere, then set sail toward the northwest. On the same third day, they were taken for investigation at a place called Mabuni Magiri and received very courteous treatment. Officials from Satsuma Domain were also present for the examination, and they were treated with even greater courtesy. During their stay, they were provided with millet, rice, one to of sake, one mosquito net, Japanese-style lined and unlined clothing, obi, and underwear. In the seventh month of the same year, they boarded a ship and departed from the same place, arriving at Yamakawa port in Satsuma in late that month. The next day they were escorted to the castle town of Kagoshima and housed at a place called the Lower Residence, where samurai, officials, regular officials, ashigaru, and others took turns standing guard.

They gestured as if asking whether they worshipped gods and Buddha with hands pressed together,
so they responded with gestures indicating that they did so. Then, they brought and showed them twenty pieces of Japanese isshu silver,
one piece of nishu stamp, one mon coin, and one Japanese-made pipe.
They responded by gestures that these were all items from their country,
whereupon they definitively understood they were Japanese. They later learned that over ten years earlier, a merchant
ship from Osaka had drifted to this place, and these items had been kept since that time.
Now, after the inquiry was completed, each person received one silver coin called "dollar,"
and regarding Manjirō, "Whitfield" expressed his desire to take him to his home country.
When told it was up to Manjirō's wishes, and assured that he would be well cared for
with no need for concern, this was explained to the four men, and Manjirō was
placed aboard the whaling ship, which then departed. At this time Manjirō was fourteen years old.

As for the four men, they were entrusted to a person like a subordinate official of the "Governor," and gradually received care,
but since language did not communicate, they spent their days in vain.
However, by the summer of the following Tiger year, language finally began to communicate, and they had roughly
learned the names of various things, so feeling sorry for receiving so much care,
they requested to do appropriate work. The magistrate kindly
told them that since they were in his custody, this was unnecessary and they should live without worry.
Before long, another year or more had passed, so they earnestly requested to do appropriate
work, and went to the "Governor's" residence to
explain this matter. It was decided that they would temporarily work as servants, splitting firewood,
drawing water, cleaning, and carrying lunch boxes.
Although Denzō's real name was Fudenosuke, when listening to how the local
people called him, it was always "Tenso" or "Denzō."

Now, Manjiro had grown up in America at "Fichsel's" house,
and this time was employed by a person from the same country called "Davis" and came aboard a whaling ship to "Oahu"
port. While the brothers had not yet landed, he came looking for them in a small boat and they met after a long
time, talking about recent events, but soon "Davis" was to depart,
so they hurriedly parted. Then again he reported the details to that "Ricord"
and through his arrangements went to a place called "Uriuri," five ri distant from "Honolulu"
port, where the brothers were doing day labor in farming. In the ninth month of the Tsuchi-no-e year, someone came from "Honolulu"
port with a message from Manjiro to summon them,
so they immediately went and met. He expressed his intention to return to Japan,
and having contacted Toraemon as well, the four gathered for pleasant conversation.
Manjiro had learned methods of geographical surveying in America and
had sailed to many countries on whaling ships, so regarding returning to Japan,

he said finding a ship for the journey would be an easy matter, so they made a firm promise.
Initially, Manjiro had parted from the four including Denbei at the royal government port of "Honolulu"
and following "Fichsel," sailed south to an island called "Kinshimekuro" where they
took aboard fishermen. This area is called the Naked Islands.
This island is not mountainous but flat land, and what appears like masts are all
coconut trees, with the islanders eating the fruit as their staple food. Being near the equator,
the heat is extreme, and needless to say there are no five grains, and no water either - they drink
the juice inside coconut fruits. As for clothing, it goes without saying,
both men and women are naked, with women using coconut leaves to barely cover their
front. When they bend forward, the rear view is indescribable.
Houses are built as small four-legged structures made from coconut wood, and also
they split coconut wood and hollow it out enough for feet to enter, float these and use bows to

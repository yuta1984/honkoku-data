As this was the custom, they were not subject to such obligations, and spent their time
taking the fish they caught to the fish market at the crossroads to sell them.
During this time, Goemon had been employed by that monk-like person "Minister."
There were "sermons" and what seemed like religious discussions,
and among the others he was called Goemon, and someone said, "Have you forgotten
me?" When he looked, it was that "Fichsel."
"How could I forget you, you are the parent of my life," and he expressed his initial
gratitude and also told of Jusuke's death from illness, whereupon he showed great sorrow
and grief, saying, "A sailor of mine called 'Captain Caufun' is
preparing a whaling ship to go fishing near Japan,
so I had intended to send you to Japan by that vessel, but now one of you has
become a dead person. How sad and homesick you must feel.

There is nothing to be done about Jusuke, but Manjiro has been well cared for while I was in my homeland,
not receiving poor treatment and being safe, so there is no need to worry. The three of you should consult together and
quickly prepare for your return home. I will make good
arrangements with 'Captain Caufman,'" he said kindly, and together they went to that beach.
Seeing their dwelling, he frowned, but using a bucket that Denzo had brought out
as a seat, he said with a wry smile, "What an elegant hermit's dwelling this is."
He inquired in detail from Denzo about their life up to that point, and Denzo told him the same as
he had told Goemon earlier. "Tomorrow let us go to the port," he said, giving them two silver coins
and departed. The next day when Goemon went to the port entrance, "Fichsel" immediately came out
to greet him, saying, "You cannot return to Japan in that attire. Wear these at least
to return to your homeland," and gave them woolen clothing and various other items.
Carrying one load of baggage back, both brothers rejoiced greatly and immediately went to "Honolulu" port.

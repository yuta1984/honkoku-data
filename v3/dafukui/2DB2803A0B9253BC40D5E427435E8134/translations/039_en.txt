As for Toraemon, he expressed his desire to remain behind, and they departed from there in the tenth month of last year. On the second day of the first month of this year, when the Ryukyu Kingdom could be seen from the ocean, they lowered the small boat, but due to strong wind and rain, landing was difficult, so they brought the boat to the shelter of mountains on land and stayed there. On the following third day, they finally came ashore. They stated that after lowering the small boat from the main ship, it sailed away in the northwest direction. Although the matter of castaways should naturally be investigated, since he came ashore from the small boat while the main ship sailed directly past, there was no choice but to examine him regarding religious matters. When questioned, he stated that he had not learned any heretical religions (Christianity), so a house was provided and he was given care. Since this matter was sent over from the Ryukyu Kingdom, he was further questioned here at this location, and as stated above, nothing suspicious was found. Therefore, I have reported in detail to the Nagasaki Magistrate that he should be sent on with guards attached. I hereby report this matter. The above.

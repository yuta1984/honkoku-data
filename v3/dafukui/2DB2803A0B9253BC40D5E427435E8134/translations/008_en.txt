and so he was renamed Denzō. As for Toraemon,
he was employed by a local carpenter and gradually became his apprentice. Jū-
suke remained at the "Governor's" residence, but from the winter of the Horse year his illness recurred
and became troublesome, so through the "Governor's" care he went to a rural area called "Cowlow," about three ri
from the port, and made his lodging at the home of a farmer named "Tethan," where a doctor was called and he convalesced, but without effect, and he developed
something like dysentery and died in the first month of the Sheep year. Receiving various
care from nearby people, they requested a monk-like person called "Minister" to handle the funeral
service, who kindly cared for them, reading what seemed like sutras, and placed him
in a coffin and buried him at a place called "Kanjiowe." Though the customs of this land do not include
abstinence or memorial services, they performed abstinence, ceremonies, and grave
visits out of their feelings. From this point the two brothers came under the care and upbringing of a person called "Towana."

While they were there, the lord of this island called "King Kauikeaouli" came from "Honolulu" port
on an inspection tour to this place and lodged at the aforementioned "Towana's" house,
summoned the brothers before him, and inquired in detail about their livelihood.
They reported their circumstances up to that point and requested that they might do some farming and
fishing during intervals in agricultural work. This was granted, and he
gave some instructions to "Towana" before returning. Afterward, they received
an allocation of farmland from "Towana," so the brothers consulted together and built a one-ken square
house on vacant land near the shore, and engaged in farming and fishing. They made fishing tackle
the same way as when they fished at Usa, and caught many bonito and other fish. While local people caught ten fish,
they caught forty or fifty. The crops were all types of potatoes, and in their case there was
no burden of tribute, and there was a population register kept by village official-type authorities,
on which occasion those fifteen years and older presented one silver coin each to the officials.

Silver horse money was presented to Saitō Hanzaemon, and after the formal audience was completed, he was summoned again and [the Shogun] came out to sit. When there were repeated instructions from above to approach closer to his presence, and [Tsunamasa] moved closer to his side, [the Shogun] said directly: "Due to the request of Hyōbu-no-taifu (the previous lord), he is granted retirement, and you are granted succession to the headship. Since you are still young, you should receive guidance from Hyōbu regarding all administrative matters and governance." [Tsunamasa] gratefully accepted this direct instruction from above. Upon departure, he made courtesy visits to the rōjū, wakadoshiyori, and Sakai Kawachi-no-kami Tadataka to express gratitude. Seven retainers also made courtesy visits to the rōjū and wakadoshiyori to express gratitude.

There was a report due to the fire incident. Subsequently, Shimbo-ura suffered fire damage, but since it was less than one hundred houses, there was naturally no official report. Regarding the Kuritabe fire, although one hundred houses were destroyed, it was deemed unnecessary to report. When Shichiemon reported this matter to the Council of Elders for consultation, they determined that this incident did not require an official report. He was instructed to proceed accordingly, keep this understanding for future reference, and maintain written records, as conveyed by Inaba Uneme's office. However, Shichiemon explained that depending on the location, there might be fires that warrant official reports, as recorded in the Edo official records.

1. On the last day of March, Kyōhō 20 (Year of the Rabbit), a fire broke out near Benzaiten in Mikuni Kamishin-machi, destroying over three hundred houses. Notably, most of the government-managed rice storehouses were destroyed. Consequently, a caretaker went to report to the duty elder, and reports were also made to the accounting office.

1. On July 8th, Genbun 4 (Year of the Sheep), a fire broke out near the gate of Shōtoku Temple in Ishiba Teramachi, destroying over one hundred houses, but no report was made.
Regarding whether this fire should be reported to the authorities: when over one hundred houses in Aomono-machi burned in previous years, an investigation was conducted but no conclusion was reached. For the Mikuni fire, a report was made; for the Kuritabe fire, no report was made as it was in rural areas. It seems that reports should be made when over one hundred houses are affected, so for this incident in the castle town, should a report be made? When this was communicated to Nishio Gentazaemon and Koma Moku in the domain, they replied that it should be reported to Edo and the caretakers should consult together. When this written matter was presented for review, the lord's opinion was: "This fire was quite serious, but since it occurred outside the citadel and in the outskirts of the castle town, a report is not necessary." He further ordered that the caretakers should consult together.

Regarding the Aomono-machi fire in previous years, no fault was found with the secretaries or caretakers here. For the Mikuni incident, an immediate report was made due to the destruction of government rice stores. For this current matter, whether a report is made or not would cause no problems. This is now a matter for consultation, as Sakata Shichiemon explained. When Shichiemon reported this to his lordship, the response was: "Even if over one hundred houses are affected, if it concerns the outskirts of the castle town, no report should be made. However, if there are injuries or other unusual circumstances, then a report should be made. If there are no unusual matters as in this case, no reports should be made in the future either. This policy should be recorded." Shichiemon reported this, and Nakanemobile Rokuzaemon was summoned and given the same instructions. Orders were given to record this policy and communicate it to the domain, as noted in the Edo official records.

1. On the night of March 22nd, Kan'en 4 (Year of the Sheep), when 126 houses were destroyed by fire originating from Tawaraya Yohei at Mitsu Bridge, no report was made to the government. ○ For castle town fires destroying over one hundred houses, reports should be made, but the handling was mistaken in this case.
However, at this time during his lordship's youth, under the guardianship of Lord Hitotsubashi, Inspector Tanabe Godayu went to Lord Hitotsubashi, and reports were made to your inspectors, as recorded.

1. On the night of July 12th, Hōreki 11 (Year of the Wood Boar), when 219 houses in Kita-Kanazu were destroyed by fire, no report was made to the government. Notably, there were no human or animal injuries.

※1. In April of the same year, reports were made for two fires in Fuchū.

1. On March 6th, Meiwa 2 (Year of the Rooster), a report was made for a fire at Fukui Ishiba.

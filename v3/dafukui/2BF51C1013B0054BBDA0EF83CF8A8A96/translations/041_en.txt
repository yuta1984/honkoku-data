Construction matters follow the traditional procedure and do not require notification, and bridge construction is not mentioned in the regulations. Regarding the aforementioned inquiry about bridge construction, orders may be issued at your discretion. Lord Fujikurō conveyed that this point should be reported.
　　However, matters such as changes in bridge width or length of spans are considered new construction and should be subject to consultation. This is a copy that Genzaemon submitted to Koma Tatewaki after making inquiries.

He stated that regarding wearing swords at construction sites, there is no one other than Noda Jin'emon, who is under our supervision. Regarding the senior military leaders' orders for squad leaders to wear swords and foot soldiers to wear short swords, these are new regulations, and it would be difficult for us to implement such measures based on our own judgment this time. This will also become a precedent for the future. From now on, we will carry out orders and serve according to whatever directions are given. The above. Date.

Dan'emon reported this written statement to the senior councillors. On the same 29th day, at Sakai Yosaburo'emon's place, it was communicated that regarding the above matter, how would it be to strictly order that squad leaders not wear swords and that foot soldiers stop wearing short swords along the route? It was communicated that the inspectors should consult with the senior military leaders to handle stopping this. Various discussions were held but no resolution was reached, so consulting with colleagues, it was said that since both sides had made strong appeals, some arrangement must be made or the senior military leaders would not be satisfied. In that case, since foot soldiers wearing short swords from Daianji to the riverbank would not hinder construction work, it should be ordered that they wear short swords to the riverbank as the senior military leaders request, and regarding squad leaders' swords, they should not wear them as the construction magistrates request. This would be a fifty-fifty arrangement so both sides could be satisfied. The senior councillors also agreed, and senior commanders Yamamoto Uemon'hachi and Takamura Shirō-zaemon went to the residence of May duty officer Kaifuku Chūza'emon to further communicate the colleagues' views. The senior military leaders' judgment on squad leaders wearing swords varied. However, Uemon'hachi and Shirō-zaemon later communicated that if this matter became a formal handling of the appeals, how would that be? After consulting repeatedly among senior colleagues, they said that if so, the construction magistrates' approach from the beginning was inappropriate, making it difficult to accept at the subordinate level. First, when squad leaders came to Daianji wearing swords, Hori Shinza'emon directed them to remove the swords immediately, saying foot soldiers should not wear swords at construction sites. While construction site matters should generally be directed by construction magistrates, squad leaders' swords do not interfere with construction work, and ordering the removal of swords worn in military capacity without any communication to the leaders seemed high-handed. Therefore, when squad leaders came again, he instructed them that since it was under the leaders' direction, they should not remove their swords, but Shinza'emon again told the squad leaders not to wear swords. When this matter of the leaders' direction was communicated, the construction magistrates sent a letter ordering that squad leaders remove their swords. Since there was precedent, it would be difficult to remove them, was the general response. Regarding this, there should have been discussions between the construction magistrates and senior military leaders, and at that time they should have consulted on how best to handle it. Everyone was discussing and waiting, but after exchanging just one letter, the construction magistrates prepared a written statement and reported to the senior councillors, which seemed hasty. This matter appeared to be presented as if the senior councillors had ordered the forcible removal. Moreover, the laborers going to construction work have recently improved their attire and carry hatchets, making them indistinguishable from foot soldiers, so the foot soldiers requested that clothing be differentiated from theirs. This matter was privately discussed with the construction magistrates last year, and they said that construction matters were their responsibility and clothing matters were of no concern whatsoever. However, this time they reported matters that do not even hinder construction work, which is difficult to understand. Regarding this matter, although various opinions were expressed to the construction magistrates, since the inspectors handled it with the senior councillors' underlying intentions, the senior councillors heard the details of these matters and thought such things were reasonable, but if appeals continued, matters would become serious and might trouble the authorities. If the inspectors conveyed orders to remove squad leaders' swords, the construction magistrates would communicate this, so since it was not a matter of removal, everyone agreed after thorough discussion that it should definitely be removed, and requested that this approach be changed. This was reported to the senior councillors on May 29th, who heard the details and said it should definitely be handled that way. May duty officers Hori Matasaburo'emon and Ōi San'emon were called, but since Matasaburo'emon was on duty and San'emon went to Uemon'hachi and Chūza'emon's place, the matter of the senior councillors' acknowledgment and inspector handling was communicated. On June 9th, Uemon'hachi and San'emon went to Chūza'emon's place and communicated the senior councillors' detailed intentions to all senior colleagues. The senior councillors heard about the senior military leaders' feelings from the beginning and thought them reasonable, but since it was a construction site, they thought it appropriate for squad leaders to remove their swords. At this point, both magistrates communicated that they respectfully accepted this as the magistrates' intention, so this was immediately reported to Sakai Genba's place. Therefore, from this point forward:

Hereafter, at the Daianji construction site, senior group squad leaders shall remove their swords when serving. Also, between the temple and boat landing, when all foot soldiers are traveling without official duties, wearing short swords does not hinder construction work so they may wear them, but they must remove them when engaged in construction work. After inquiring whether this should be communicated to the construction magistrates, the construction magistrates were summoned. Since Hori Shinza'emon went to monthly duty officer Tochiya Han'emon's residence, this matter was communicated and acknowledged. At that time, Shinza'emon asked whether this matter was limited to Daianji construction. It was communicated that what was reported this time was definitely limited to Daianji, and this was again reported to Genba's place.

Genbun 1, Year of the Rabbit, 6th month, 16th day
　Due to construction of the Futakuchi New Bridge, cattle and horses should pass from the highway through Jizō-machi, and those suitable for walking should take the detour from Kaihatsu Bridge to in front of Matsumoto Tennō. When district magistrate Oguri Jiemon inquired whether signboards should be erected for this purpose, he was instructed through Matsudaira Shōbei that this should indeed be implemented.

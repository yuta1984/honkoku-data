However, the understanding of colleagues during off-duty months should follow the same procedures as when the lord is in residence.

1. In the 4th year of Kan'en (Year of the Sheep), Koma Tachimachi conveyed that during fires in the castle town when the lord is absent, senior retainers should proceed to within the Dismount Gate depending on wind conditions. At that time, it would be desirable for one magistrate to proceed to the same location. In this way, since all magistrates would go to the fire source, when senior retainers proceed to within the Dismount Gate, orders would be conveyed from the duty officer to the fire source, so it would be desirable for one colleague to proceed accompanied by foot soldier magistrates.

However, during years when the lord is in residence, they proceed to the lord's quarters. Of course, one foot soldier magistrate should bring all hand units.

1. On October 20th of Kyōhō 16 (Year of the Boar), during a fire at a place called Doihara near Mawari-machi at night, all magistrates proceeded there, but Kaifuku Chūzaemon was under house arrest and did not go to the fire scene.

1. During the Ōhashi bridge construction in Kyōhō 12 (Year of the Sheep), when asked about procedures for the naval commander during fires, there are records stating that he should proceed to the bridge post and during urgent fires, even cut through barrier seals to enter, with this information also conveyed to the construction magistrate.

1. During the great fire in Gofuku-machi in August of Kansei 4 (Year of the Rat), Construction Magistrate Suzuki Kohei's former deputy Nambu Rinemon was guilty of negligence, so Kohei was also ordered to refrain from activities outside official duties, but he proceeded to the fire source due to the great fire.

1. During castle town fires, when various retainers are stationed at assembly points, unit members submit written reports, which should be shown to senior retainers at the opportunity and also sent to colleagues in Edo.

However, inspections of assembly locations should be conducted by water patrol personnel day and night, and of course without carrying fire hooks.

1. During such occasions, town patrol unit members should first proceed quickly to the fire source, conduct preliminary inspections, and report the situation to their respective heads en route. Furthermore, among these personnel, observations of shrine fire brigades, Unshōji, Kōkenji, or bridge guards should be reported to the monthly duty officer later. However, without fire hooks.

1. When there are personnel changes and there are those in charge of fire locations, this should be reported by the monthly duty magistrate.

1. On February 14th of Kyōwa 1 (Year of the Rooster), regarding Nagami Matsunosuke, Takada Mibunosuke, and Ōta Umon concerning Unshōji fire brigade matters, there had been previous inquiries about procedural understanding which were reported to the senior retainers. They were told to convey the following, so this was communicated to the fire brigade personnel:

At Unshōji Temple, although the memorial tablet hall construction has been strictly ordered to be built as a fireproof storehouse, during nearby fires, it would be even better if the memorial tablet hall consulted and provided protection toward the mountain side depending on wind conditions. After confirming the handling of memorial tablets, the temple's fire brigade should be deeply concerned. Since there were previous definitive inquiries about this matter, this should be communicated to the Unshōji fire brigade.

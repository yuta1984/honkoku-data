suffered fire damage, so this was also reported in the same manner and conveyed to the Senior Monthly Duty Officer. At this time, since the Senior Unit had few personnel, it became difficult to dispatch Senior Unit members as supervisors for rice boats going down the Mikuni River, so this matter was reported to the Magistrate, requesting that Long Spear Unit members be reassigned as supervisors instead.

1. Since all members of Senior Commander Higuchi Kizaemon's group suffered fire damage, a written petition was submitted through Senior Monthly Duty Officer Ota Saburobē to the senior retainers requesting exemption from various duties. They were told to help each other in performing duties, so Kizaemon was informed that he would temporarily step down from regular duty and serve as an assistant. Additionally, although Saburobē's group members had all suffered fire damage, he reported that he could continue to maintain guard duty at the camp quarters in the third month.

1. May 1st, Kyōhō 12 (Year of the Sheep) - Sugita Dan'nana went to Masugi Shozaemon's residence and reported: "A man named Miyagawa Takebē from my group had an arson attempt at the toilet beside his house on the evening of the 29th of last month (Year of the Dragon). We discovered it and immediately extinguished it. The fire was not visible enough for people to notice, and even the neighbors were unaware, so we did not make an urgent report through intermediaries. However, since there had been an arson attempt at this person's place in previous years, making this the second incident, we conducted a thorough investigation." This matter is recorded in the files.

1. July 8th, Genbun 4 (Year of the Sheep) - Temple Town's Oguri Kuemon and Nakamura Tarozaemon's groups completely suffered fire damage. Since they could not perform official duties until temporary shelters were built, they submitted a written petition requesting exemption from guard duties and other obligations. The two men could not be officially told they were exempt from their foster parent duties due to their group members' fire damage, but it would be appropriate for the Chamberlain to inform them that their guard duties would be temporarily suspended due to their circumstances, as advised by the Construction Office. Details of the various arrangements are recorded under the entry for the 10th of the same month. On the 24th of the same month, there was a request to resume guard duties along with the reformed groups, and this is recorded in the arrangement files.

1. November 11th of the same year - A man named Saikawa Yazaemon from Hayashi Matazaemon's group caused a fire while away on official business delivering rice to the Hirose Granary. He was recalled on the 5th and placed under house arrest, but Matazaemon reported to the senior retainers requesting his release starting today.

1. On the 7th day of the 5th month of Bunka 1 (1804), ashigaru Kondo Gensuke, who was residing in the Keya borrowed residence for ashigaru-metsuke, petitioned to return the property. This was communicated to Kaifuku Ihei. Since the residence was to be left vacant, instructions were given to Imadate Sukezaemon to provide two naginata bearers as caretakers. During the handover, one group member was sent as a witness and reported that there were no issues. However, on the 2nd day of the 6th month, the elevated residence was lent to ashigaru-metsuke Makino Manemon, and this was conveyed to him. Since the property transfer was scheduled for around 4 o'clock on the 3rd day, the estate magistrate was instructed to handle it as before. It was communicated to the monthly magistrate that there was no need to provide caretakers after the transfer was completed. Additionally, instructions were given to the group leader to send one official group member during the property transfer. (Marginal note: Since the fence of the Keya residence was severely damaged, 15 monme of silver was provided from internal funds to Gensuke on the 23rd of the same month for self-repairs.)

1. 4th day of the intercalary 6th month of Bunka 5 (1808)
Regarding Yamaguchi Sakuemon of Nara Sukezaemon's group within the official land of ashigaru group leader Mizuno Seitadayu's elevated residence, who had been granted an exchange for archery ground: please acknowledge this matter and take appropriate action.
The same exchange petition was approved as requested, and this should be communicated to Sukezaemon. Murata Jutadayu
Regarding this matter, land survey should be conducted as before, as communicated to the estate magistrate.

These two articles are incorrectly placed here and should be included in the land section.

1. On the 20th day of the 1st month of Koka 1 (1844), regarding Okabe Sazen's residence which had no rear gate, a petition was approved to borrow land from the accounting office grounds to establish an emergency exit, with a land survey conducted on the 28th.

1. On the 25th day of the 4th month of the same year, the western portion of Higuchi Kizaemon's residential land, measuring five ken by seven ken and four shaku, was designated for official use and granted to Kuno Ihei due to the cramped conditions of his training facility.

1. In the [blank] month of Koka 1 (1844), regarding Yoshida Teizo, who serves as a Buddhist monk in the library department and is skilled in scholarship, when he inquired whether thatched roofing would be problematic for constructing a facility for teaching reading, he was informed that it would not be problematic.

[Red notation below] "On the 11th day of the 10th month, regarding Arako Rinzemon's quarters assistant Hachi, north of the Sakura Baba earthwork lower official residence, within the currently held Katsumi territory: due to certain circumstances, an exchange was ordered with ashigaru residential land south of the same location."

○1. On the 25th day of the 8th month of Kyoho 16 (1731), the senior retainers communicated that regarding the petition by Oka Hanemon for additional land for subordinate residences of ninja under Ihara Josuke's supervision, the same allocation previously granted to subordinates would be provided, as conveyed to Josuke at Edo, and this should be communicated to Hanemon.
However, on the 5th day of the 7th month, Hanemon petitioned through monthly administrator Atsumi Shinemon via written statement that since only two ninja subordinates were building and residing in houses, the standard allocation of forty tsubo and four bu per person (the character "ten" may be missing) [with the regulation being 20 tsubo 2 bu per person, two people would require 40 tsubo 4 bu] would make it difficult to build and maintain residences. Therefore, please grant additional land sufficient for two people to build houses and reside. Until two years ago, the residential land granted to two subordinates was provided in slightly larger amounts, as detailed in various records.
Note that two years ago, two ninja subordinates were discontinued due to cost-cutting measures, but last year two were again appointed, as noted in the various groups section.

1. On the 29th day of the 8th month of the same year, cleaning magistrate Kuzuoka Sozaemon petitioned that cleaning squad leader Masuda Yaemon, who resided in Kodogumachi, had his house destroyed in the recent flood. Since there was vacant granted land in the same town belonging to tool craftsmen, he requested an exchange to this location. After consultation among the magistrates, it was determined that tool craftsmen could petition for relocation at any time, making it difficult to transfer to others, and the palanquin bearers' group did not approve, so the matter was dropped, as detailed in the records.

○1. On the 25th day of the intercalary 5th month of Kyoho 17 (1732), the residential land granted to the aforementioned two ninja subordinates was located on ashigaru Yasumi Gonhachi's residential land near where the ninja group members resided. Including the additional land, the front measured 2 ken 3 shaku, extending 3 ken to the rear, plus a 2 shaku drainage channel, totaling slightly over 3 bu. As replacement for Gonhachi's residential land, substitute land was granted in the fire prevention area near Sakura Baba.

1. On the 11th day of the 11th month of the same year, ashigaru-metsuke Katsuda Monzo petitioned for suitable residential land near Nishimura Heikuro at the end of Kannonmachi, submitting a written statement to the senior retainers. On the 21st of the same month, he was granted land adjacent to Heikuro.

1. On the 16th day of the 6th month of Genbun 4 (1739), Hatano Bunemon reported that there had been 17 vacant granted residential lots for ashigaru in Esashimachi from before, but 10 were confiscated for Matsuoka relocation official use in previous years, leaving 7. Now, for Katayama Kumenosuke's relocation official use, replacement residential land should be provided as before. Previously, replacement land was granted at vacant Sakura Baba land, with the understanding that since Sakura Baba was fire prevention land, permission would be required for house construction and alternative land would be provided again. Since this time involves only 7 residential lots, it was requested that land be granted at Sakura Baba together with the previous 10 lots. The senior retainers responded on the 25th that 4 of the previously mentioned ashigaru would receive replacement land at Sakura Baba, and the remaining 3 would also receive residential land at the same location.

1. On the last day of the 1st month of Kan'en 2 (1749), Oguri Kuemon submitted the following written statement:
Memorandum of Oral Statement
My group town is located behind Katsumi Kawaraguchi-machi, with only one access road and no other routes. During fires, this causes difficulties. During frequent floods, passage becomes difficult. Therefore, please conduct an investigation and establish a passage route and back road from the group town to the main street. Please convey these matters to the senior retainers. Respectfully submitted to Nara Gonzaemon-sama, 1st month, Oguri Kuemon

When this was communicated to the senior retainers, after various investigations, it was determined that there were obstructing locations and the request could not be approved as petitioned, as communicated by Ashida Zusho's office.

1. While house construction petitions from samurai and above are communicated to senior retainers, regarding ashigaru residential house construction petitions, even when written statements are submitted by ashigaru leaders, these should be handled at the discretion of same-rank deliberation and communicated accordingly. This was communicated by the ashigaru leader and also to the estate magistrate.
However, matters communicated to ashigaru leaders should be conveyed as if communicated to senior retainers. On the 15th day of the 11th month of Kaei 1 (1848), ashigaru Oka Sagoemon's house construction petition followed this procedure.

1. Matters concerning the handling of ashigaru-metsuke official residence transfers appear in the official residences section.

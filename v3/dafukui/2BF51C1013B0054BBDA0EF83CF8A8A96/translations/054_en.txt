　　【Red notation】Regulations for Residence Inspections
　1. When a residence transfer is ordered and the resident reports that the house has been vacated, group members shall be dispatched to inspect, ensuring that tatami mats and other floor coverings are not touched at all. The residence magistrate shall go and inspect personally. Regarding floor coverings, the tea room and inner areas, especially the formal reception room, should have tatami mat flooring.
　　However, storage rooms and small chambers may use thin reed mats without issue. Areas below the tea room level may use thin reed mats or straw mats without problem. After the residence magistrate takes possession and transfers it to the resident, subsequent mutual exchanges of floor coverings and other items shall be at the discretion of the parties involved.
　1. Fixtures should be inspected to ensure nothing is lacking. Generally, where there are door sills and lintels both inside and outside, fixtures should be installed upon taking possession. However, regarding doors, sliding screens, shoji, or wooden doors are all acceptable, though there should be appropriate features according to the location. Rain shutters must be wooden doors.
　1. Regarding shelves and similar items, even if they are additions, if their removal causes no damage, there is no problem. If they are built-in fixtures that would cause damage upon removal, they must not be removed. Generally, additions are exceptional, but laid stone slabs or steps that are fixed installations attached to the ground must not be dug up and removed. Among items placed on the ground, mortars are considered movable equipment and may be taken. Also, for movable equipment, where there are second floors, ladders should be left behind, and where there are wells, buckets should be left behind.
　　However, stone sand baskets or stone bowls placed flat on the ground may be removed with proper notification. Water conduits and reservoirs should be left as they are.
　1. Plants, flowers, garden stones and similar items must not be touched at all. Generally, any places within the residence where soil has been newly disturbed should be carefully examined.

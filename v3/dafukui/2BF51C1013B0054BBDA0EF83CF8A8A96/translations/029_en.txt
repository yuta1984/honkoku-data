1. On March 29th, Bunka 1, Year of the Rat, commendations were given to those who showed diligence during the fire at Keya Twenty-three Houses District on the 16th, starting with the Takachi group.

[Red ink notation] On March 23rd, Genroku 5, Year of the Monkey, the seven fire brigade officials - Ashida Uemon, Honda Kankayu, Matsudaira Shuma, Sugita Danjō, Sasaji Daigaku, Inaba Uneme, and Saitō Ukon - were summoned to the Audience Chamber. Since each has the duty to rush out immediately when fires occur, this should be done accordingly. However, it is proper to generally ascertain the fire source before going out. Also, two people each should be designated as reserve duty from among these, in case there might be other fires elsewhere that need to be watched. Since Matsudaira Shuma serves as an elder, he should be fixed as a regular reserve among the reserve duties, and the other person should take turns. This was ordered as stated above, so today with Koma Mokunosuke, Honda Sahyōe, and Koma Taitō in attendance, Mokunosuke conveyed the lord's intentions to these individuals. Administrative Office Record.

1. Regarding going to the lord's residence for fires in Kan'en 1, Year of the Dragon, this was ordered and recorded in the Thunder and Earthquake section.

1. Same year, October 24th. Koma Moku, Sakai Naizen, Inaba Tamiya, Okabe Ukyō, Ōtani Sukeroku
Regarding ringing bells when fires occur, bells should be rung as soon as fires are discovered. This should have been done until now, but henceforth colleagues should consult together to ring them as quickly as possible. This way, various places can be notified promptly, which would be good. Regarding deployment, since this may not be possible at such times, [officials] should go out promptly as soon as preparations are complete. Of course, those whose preparations are complete may go out before the monthly duty officer. Such matters are not problematic. In any case, promptly notifying various places is most important. It was ordered that this should be communicated as stated.

[Red text] 1. On March 25th, Genroku 11, Year of the Tiger, it was ordered by His Lordship that the Takachi group should hang gongs at the fire watchtowers of the monthly fire brigade, which would be good for striking in case of fires. Today at Sakai Tenzui's residence, this was conveyed to Honda Tosho and Ashida Uemon. It was also communicated that this should be passed on to colleagues. However, if individuals do not possess gongs, they may be lent from the lord, and when this was communicated, since they wished to borrow them, this was also conveyed by Tenzui to Inspector Yukifuki Kizaemon to contact the Armory to provide them.

1. On November 17th, same 19th year, Year of the Tiger, at the Audience Chamber, the senior councilors told the inspectors at Sakai Gemba's quarters: At fire scenes [insect damage] regarding the fire brigade members' firefighting methods, personnel numbers, etc. [insect damage] giving overbearing instructions [insect damage] is unnecessary. Although the Takachi fire brigade has been discontinued in recent years [insect damage] you inspectors should understand that giving overbearing instructions to the fire brigade is unnecessary. The reason for this communication is that when particularly overbearing instructions are given during firefighting, there may be bad responses from the fire brigade, which would be problematic, so this is communicated for your understanding. Whatever we communicate follows your instructions, so we understand. We think that rushing to fire scenes is primarily for fire prevention, and we go out thinking it is loyal service to rush around and coordinate so that it doesn't become a major fire. Since this was communicated, even if we have opinions when we go out, we should keep them to ourselves. When this was communicated, Gemba said: Even understanding this way won't work. If there are things you think of at the scene, you should discuss without being overbearing, such as "might it be good to deploy your personnel?" When this was communicated again: Since fire scenes are different from quiet meetings, in the midst of confusion voices become loud, and at times when things can't be heard, the situation is not as you might wish, so how should this degree be handled? When this was asked, Gemba said: That is reasonable, but first understand it this way and exercise that degree of judgment. Understanding this, [the speaker] immediately assembled with colleagues, went before [the lord], and reported these details. The next day, the 18th, monthly duty officer Tochiaya Hanemon was summoned, and regarding yesterday's report about fire scene matters, His Lordship's thoughts would be communicated through retainers, which should be humbly received. This was communicated to colleagues, and on the 19th, Sasaji Gon'emon told colleagues: Regarding fire scene matters, each has things to say, but understand as Gemba communicated, don't be overbearing, and exercise that degree of judgment so it doesn't become a major fire. This was humbly received.

1. On the 28th of the same month, Matsudaira Shōbei and Koma Moku told monthly duty officer Hanemon: Until now, when fires occur in the castle town, bells are struck, but there are no instruments for false alarms. There are precedents of quickly dampening when bells are struck after mistaking fires in outlying areas or spotting slight smoke in the castle town. When bells are struck initially, since the situation is unclear whether it's quick dampening or a mistake, the castle town becomes agitated, so in such cases they wanted to strike boards at the watchtower. When asked whether striking these boards required permission or whether they should report to and consult with the senior councilors, they wanted to first report to the senior councilors for acknowledgment. When inquired, they were told that while such things were ordered at watchtowers when provincial inspectors visited in previous years, striking dampening boards regularly has never been done before, so it should be reported for hearing. On December 1st, Gemba told Hanemon that the boards should be struck depending on circumstances, which should be communicated to Shōbei and Moku. Regarding this, it was later communicated by Gemba that senior councilors should continue to communicate about striking dampening boards as before, and this was passed on to various people.

1. On March 29th, Genbun 2, Year of the Snake, to Magistrate Tsuchiya Jūrōemon: When fires occur in the castle town, town scaffolding workers whose houses are also affected by fire spread have previously received [insect damage] compensation when they work. This time, since many houses in Seigenji Village were affected by fire spread and they worked, one ryō in cash should be given to all scaffolding workers, as ordered by the senior councilors.

1. On June 15th, Enkyō 2, Year of the Ox, Tsuda Gennosuke was burning hemp wood ash at the archery range, so smoke would naturally rise. This precedent was also communicated by Gennosuke to the monthly fire brigade duty, but there was a slight misunderstanding and bells were struck {{causing a commotion | recorded}}.

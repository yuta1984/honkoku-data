1. On the 2nd day of the 2nd month of Kyōhō 9 (1724), regarding the petition submitted due to financial hardship of the advance foot soldiers:

1. Concerning the construction duties of the foot soldiers: there has been an established law from previous years, and those in service who finished their work diligently used to complete tasks and return home even before or after noon. However, in recent years, they have been ordered to work until the seventh hour (around 4 PM), and by the time they return home, it has become evening. Therefore, they prepare from around 7:30 AM and work until that time, but the lunch provided is insufficient, leading to various expenses and extreme hardship. The foot soldiers previously served 3-step or 5-step roles and, in addition to finishing their duties diligently, had assistants, so they could cover for sick or mourning personnel without requesting substitutes. However, as their duties have gradually increased, their household finances have become strained. Henceforth, they request that those promoted from gate guard duties and those who are sick or in mourning be appointed as substitutes. (Details omitted)

1. On the 25th day of the 9th month of the same 11th year: Nomura Kihei of Yamamoto Uemon-hachi's group, being naturally weak, found it extremely difficult to perform construction duties, so Uemon-hachi petitioned in the past 6th month for exemption from the 7-step role. After various deliberations by the senior councilors, it was found that Katsushima Kitauemon of Nomura Ichirōzaemon's group had also been exempted from the 7-step role from the beginning. With this precedent and no interference with other matters, the exemption from the 7-step role for Kihei was conveyed to Uemon-hachi, and it was decided that Shozaemon, the monthly duty officer, should inform the construction magistrates.

1. On the 6th day of the 4th month of the same 13th year: Regarding the construction for relocating the lord's residence, there is a record of transferring locks and keys at the small entrance from the castle deputy's office to the construction office during the construction period.

1. In the same 16th year: Regarding the matter of swords and short swords of the advance foot soldiers at the Daian-ji temple construction site, this case appears in the temple construction regulations.

1. On the 11th day of the 11th month of the same year: The construction tools and lumber held by the construction office had no previous accounting records. Henceforth, accounting for these items was ordered, and the senior councilors informed the construction magistrates in writing that annual accounting would be required.

1. On the 11th day of the 4th month of the same 17th year: When retainers wish to borrow tools from the construction office, if they are for unavoidable house construction needs, the items should be acknowledged and reported, and permission should be sought from the senior councilors each time before lending, as conveyed by the senior councilors to construction magistrate Suzuki Genbei.

1. From the 18th day of the 1st month of the same 19th year: Construction for relocating the lord's residence took place.

1. On the 13th day of the 11th month of Genbun 1 (1736): Okabe Sazen reported that Ihara Jōsuke, being in military service, was exempted from construction silver payments as ordered, and this was to be communicated to the construction magistrates by letter.

1. On the 16th day of the 12th month of Kanpō 1 (1741): The senior guard leaders petitioned for exemption from construction service silver. The senior councilors ordered the construction magistrates to investigate. After investigation, due to existing laws, granting the exemption would affect others adversely. Today, Ō Tōjibei reported this to the senior councilors, who acknowledged the report.

1. On the 9th day of the 6th month of Kyōhō 16 (1731): Regarding the Daian-ji stone pagoda construction, the advance group foot soldier squad leaders wore swords and construction foot soldiers wore short swords. The construction magistrates had their own opinions, with frequent reports from construction magistrates to the advance unit commanders. Since both sides had various opinions, after consultation, it was decided that squad leaders would not wear swords, construction foot soldiers would wear short swords up to the dock area, and during construction work they would remove short swords as per castle town regulations. This decision was communicated from inspector Tochiya Hanemon to the unit commanders.

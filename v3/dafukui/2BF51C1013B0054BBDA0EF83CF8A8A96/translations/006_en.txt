1. On April 23rd, Kyōhō 17 (Year of the Rat) - The second floor where firewood and other items were stored above the kitchen of yoriai Nagami Tamon caught fire slightly, but was quickly extinguished. However, the flames were visible from the window, and moreover, the roof had been damaged by recent strong winds and had not yet been repaired. With flames visible from such a location, various rumors about the fire spread externally. Although the fire did not spread to the roof, since this matter concerned the inner citadel, it was extremely improper and caused great distress. Consequently, it was reported that a period of restraint was imposed, as communicated by colleague Tominaga Shinzaemon. Since the fire did not spread to other houses, restraint was not necessary. However, regarding recent orders concerning matters within the inner citadel, it was instructed to communicate that such matters should be handled even more strictly.

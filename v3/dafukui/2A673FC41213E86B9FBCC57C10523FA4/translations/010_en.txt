There is a shrine to Myōjin. It is said to have been handed down that this was dedicated in ancient times, and there is a sword with the inscription "Munechika." It is a tachi (long sword) in a kaji-bōzaya (wooden scabbard). The Shinto priest of this shrine is called Yoshida Kunaishōyū. His father was called Yoshida Hyūga-no-kami. Perhaps this Hyūga-no-kami left a written record, as there is an inscription "Kogitsune-maru Akira" on the wooden scabbard. We have written down the detailed appearance of this tachi and sent it forward, so we respectfully submit it. For what reason and from whom was this tachi dedicated? We investigated whether there were any traditions or stories handed down regarding this tachi, but we could not learn anything about that matter at all.

We reported this. Besides this, we investigated the entire domain without exception, but there are no others. Please report the above matter when convenient. The above.

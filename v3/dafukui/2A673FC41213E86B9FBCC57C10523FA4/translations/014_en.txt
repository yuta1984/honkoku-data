went out, where he was ordered that in case of fires, personnel should be sent out for firefighting, and the following written instructions were given:

Matsudaira Iyo no kami
In case of fire, when the wind is strong and it appears it may become a great fire, you shall work to prevent it. You yourself need not go out personally, but shall send out only mounted personnel and other men. Regarding the said personnel, you should understand according to the separate written instructions. In connection with this, during times of fire, one person from among the keeper of residence should be stationed at the guard post at the corner intersection by the front gate of Sakakibara Shikibu Dayū's upper residence. Fire prevention duties will be assigned through the metsuke (inspectors) and ometsuke ban (guard officers), so you should bring personnel to the designated locations as instructed. The said prepared personnel should be stationed within the residence. The keeper of residence going out to that intersection guard post is not necessary for small fires or distant fires.

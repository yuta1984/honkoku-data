Such duties must be performed. Furthermore, consultation with Suzuki Hikotayū is required for proper execution. It would be wrong to think only of making tax collection strict. However, it would also be fruitless to be too lenient and fail to collect taxes. This matter should be discussed with Hikotayū. Generally, regarding tax collection offices, one should examine and handle which farmers among them can pay and which cannot. Lower officials arranging convenience through intermediation of gold, silver, and rice for tax payment should be strictly prohibited as this leads to confusion.

First and foremost, deputies must be strictly ordered not to accept even the smallest bribes. This matter is of utmost importance. Those who violate this, even if they perform well in all other aspects as tax collectors, will be considered extremely negligent. Even if deputies incur losses due to miscalculation, if there are circumstances warranting it upon investigation, there may be grounds for leniency. However, those involved in bribery will certainly face punishment, so this should be understood. Generally, in the domain territory, deputies should be ordered not to borrow gold, silver, or rice for financing purposes.

If there are deputies who have accumulated gold and silver, it is perfectly acceptable for them to provide financing externally, but they should report this without concealment. All matters should be discussed with Hikotayū before execution.

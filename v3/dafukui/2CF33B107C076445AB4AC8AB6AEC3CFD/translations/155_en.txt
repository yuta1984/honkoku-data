The announcement was made with his lordship's intention, after a long interval. On this occasion, the sliding doors between rooms were opened to the left and right, and the audiences with Hakuryuji Temple, Hokanji Temple, and Honryoin Temple were completed. After changing clothes and donning hakama, he took his seat on the upper level of the study. The abbot offered kelp and exchanged seasonal greetings, then withdrew. The kelp was retrieved by the page, and the hakama was removed. At this time, offerings were presented and announced by the chamberlain. Incidentally, there was a request for exemption from formal court dress, and the meal was taken in ordinary clothes by all present. He then entered the front garden and mountain area, guided leisurely by temple officials, and re-entered the study. Fine sake was offered, the retinue was assembled, and the abbot saw him off to the rest area with words of "Please take your time today." He returned to the palace, wearing hakama during the journey.

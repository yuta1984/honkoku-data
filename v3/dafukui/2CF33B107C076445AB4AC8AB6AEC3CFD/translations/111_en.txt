On the 17th day of the 7th month, due to intense residual heat causing discomfort in the interior rooms, in the evening moved to the main hall where the second meal was taken in the same room, continuing this practice thereafter

On the night of the 27th day of the 7th month, although retired in the Great Interior, from the first year of Tenpō (1830), after consultation with senior advisors, it was decided that henceforth retirement would be in the formal quarters. The reason this was not recorded in the inner guard logs was that in the previous two years there were scheduling conflicts requiring retirement in the formal quarters, so no special record was kept. From this year, orders were given to ensure no mistakes

However, as this interfered with rank protocols, the entire group of the same rank wished to petition together, but as this corresponded to disrespect, Shinemon and Kobei submitted a petition via written appeal to senior personal retainer Ōmiya Tōma. Today Tōma responded as follows, saying to understand the following going forward:
Previously it was announced that all oral reports should be written as "respectfully reported to the senior councilors," but as there are also matters of private communication, going forward they should be written as "please kindly relate to the senior councilors." The phrase "should there be inquiries" should not be written, so understand accordingly. There will be no renewed directive from the inspector regarding this matter, it was reported. However, even if submissions mixing "respectfully relate" are presented, the senior councilors will accept them.

One item: This evening's year-end celebration with soup, sake, and third meal was celebrated. For the same reason, gifts were received not before his lordship as in the year before last, but were ordered to be received in chambers, with record kept by the meal attendants.

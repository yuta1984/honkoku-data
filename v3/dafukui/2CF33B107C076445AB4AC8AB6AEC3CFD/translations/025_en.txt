Nakazawa Hayato has also been confined for a long time, leaving only Kobei, so following precedent and with permission, the duty shift ends. When one of the three Chamberlain Chiefs is absent, the remaining two serve alternate shifts. With only Kobei remaining, he serves duty on alternating days.

One　September 2nd　This morning before departing the palace, the archery initiation ceremony was held as His Lordship began studying archery, with Iijima Shiroemon and his son attending to arrangements. At the practice ground, decorations should be set up before the altar seven days prior to the ceremony, but this time in abbreviated form, decorations were set up and completed on the first day, then set up again on the actual day. When preparations were complete, Shiroemon reported and His Lordship entered the practice ground. He wore a hemp formal dress with silk hakama. First he worshipped before the altar, then Shiroemon presented the bow and arrows, which His Lordship received ceremonially, then passed to a page, then partook of sacred sake and was seated. Here Shiroemon performed the ritual entrance which His Lordship observed. When finished, Shiroemon expressed gratitude to the domain official, received words of praise ("auspicious"), the domain official responded, and received further words ("well done"), concluding the ceremony. However, no practice was conducted today. For this ceremony: one domain official, one practice supervisor, duty officials, two pages, and Shiroemon father and son wore silk and hemp formal dress; others wore ordinary clothes.

1. Today the senior retainers paid their respects and expressed their congratulations for the postponed birthday celebration of the young lord. For this occasion, gift lists were presented in the inner quarters.

1. 29th day of 8th month: As pine mushrooms are being sent successively from Mt. Tate, according to annual custom they were bestowed upon the senior retainers, middle-ranking elders, chamberlains, side attendants, escort leaders, physicians, retired physicians, and tea ceremony masters, with arrangements made by the meal attendants. Details are recorded elsewhere.

1. Tonight an express messenger departed, and salted sweetfish were sent to Edo as follows, arranged by the meal attendants:
　　　To Hime-gimi-sama: 50 salted sweetfish in tubs
　　　To Wakadono-sama, Kiku-hime-sama, Koto-hime-sama, Tsutsushimi-hime-sama: 30 each
　　　　　20 each　　　　　　　　　　to four senior ladies of the residence
　　　　　15 each　　　　　　　　　　to two personal senior ladies
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　to Jusen
　For the middle-ranking ladies and below of the residence, they were to receive more when sweetfish became available again, but since cormorant fishing was discontinued this year and sweetfish are in short supply, it was done this way.

1. 30th day of 8th month: From now on, during archery, spear, and sword practice sessions, Kengoro-sama should also enter the main castle, observe the proceedings, and depending on the situation, may also practice. Of course, this does not mean he must enter for every regular practice session, but should do so according to convenience. This intention was announced and conveyed to Nakane Shinroku.

1. A reply letter was sent to Matsudaira Hyuga-no-kami-sama:
　　　Nanako silk weave: 2 rolls
　　　Sea urchin: 1 jar
　The above were sent and submitted to the accounting office. They were sent out with tonight's town messenger. Of course, prior inquiry was made with the magistrate. However, on the 15th of this month from Hyuga-no-kami-sama in Osaka:
　　　Direct letter
　　　Confections: 1 box
　　　Chinese ink: 1 case
　　　Brushes: 2 pairs, large and small
　The above were sent with a letter from your side attendants. A person called Nagataya Sabrosuke of Kanazu rapeseed oil shop, who has long served in Hyuga-no-kami-sama's mansion, went to Osaka for congratulations, and brought these back when he returned, which is why they were presented.

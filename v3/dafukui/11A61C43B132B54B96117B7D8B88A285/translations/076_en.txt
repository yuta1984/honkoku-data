Places in the former domain's samurai residences and castle grounds
　　　where strange apparitions are said to appear

In the western part of Shin-yashiki's Sakura Baba (Cherry Blossom Horse Ground), along the road from Katsumi-suji, in the area of about two to three cho between Moto-gun-gumi and Yonban-cho, there are no residences on either side. In the middle of this area, at a three-way intersection, there is a small elevated earthwork called umadashi, where three large trees known as "Sanbon-matsu" (Three Pines) stand. Furthermore, the earthworks, tree-lined paths, and bamboo groves extending from the horse grounds grow thick, presenting an eerie atmosphere at night. In the dead of night, perhaps due to the work of tengu (supernatural beings), stones are thrown, and there have been those who, since ancient times, were terrified by what is called "tsurube-otoshi" - the sight of lanterns hanging from the branches of those pine trees.

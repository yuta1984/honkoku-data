Copy of document attached by the senior retainers when the above written report was sent to Edo:

1. Kome-machi Kanzaemon's father, Sōen, age 80
1. Same town's Kyūzaemon's father, Zencho, age 72

These two men state: One hyō of tax rice is measured as 5 to 6 shō using town measures. This has been established since the time of Shibata Katsuie, using stamped measures with his seal, called "Katsuie-sealed measures." Later, when Lord Ryūhōin entered the domain, hanging scales were established, and one hyō of tax rice came to be measured as 5 to 3 shō 6 gō. Kyoto measures and stipend measures - these two types have not existed in town for sixty years.

1. The difference between measures from Katsuie's time and hanging-scale measures is slight, within one shaku. The measures from Katsuie's time, used for 5 to 6 shō quantities, have no suspension [mechanism]

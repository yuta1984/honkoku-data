　　　　　Story of the Elderly
Learning from a child on one's back how to cross shallow waters - this is
　an age-old teaching metaphor. Also, when people are compassionate and kind,
　we call it "an old woman's heart," but why is it that old men
　lack such consideration? Instead, they tend to be disliked for being stubborn and bound to old customs.
　Six Poetic Sages of Old Age:
　　Wrinkles appear, moles develop, the back shrinks
　　The head goes bald, hair turns white
　　Hands tremble, feet stumble, teeth fall out
　　Ears grow deaf, eyes grow dim

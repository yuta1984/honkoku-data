Unable to achieve its purpose despite jumping repeatedly, the rat eventually hid somewhere.
After a while, many rats emerged in a group and noisily pulled something up to the beams with
squeaking sounds. Upon careful observation, it was found that they had placed
an aged rat with patchy, balding fur upon a horse's hoof.
Settling into a proper position and surveying the situation,
the old rat squeaked instructions to a young rat nearby.
The young rat immediately ran off and soon returned soaked with water,
appearing as a drowned rat, and crouched respectfully before the hoof. When the old rat squeaked again,
in an instant the young rat leaped at the bag, causing it to burst open
and spill out completely. The old rat then withdrew
as before. The master of the house, impressed by this old rat's ingenuity,
gave them the spilled contents without taking a single grain (to their nest).
Though this may seem like a trivial tale, if even such small creatures can devise such schemes,
how much more so must humans, being the masters of all creation, each possess
varying degrees of virtue and wisdom according to their nature, and through their various trades and occupations
surely have old stories of gains and losses, benefits and harms.
Therefore, one should make the effort to listen carefully to beneficial matters.

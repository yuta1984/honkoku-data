　　　　On Music
First, music has been transmitted to the three countries of Asia since ancient times, but following the changes of the times, Tenjiku (India) and China have undergone various changes from ancient times, while the orthodox musical scales and rhythms of the Eight Sounds and Five Pitches have been properly transmitted to our country (Japan). In Kyoto, houses of court musicians have been established, and they perform court music for various ceremonial occasions, serving in the execution of Shinto rituals and festival ceremonies. They also grant transmission licenses to those who earnestly wish to enter the discipline, and they invariably perform music at grand festivals of shrines throughout the provinces and Buddhist ceremonies at temples.

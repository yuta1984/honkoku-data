One Hundred Poems on Tea Ceremony
The heart that wishes to enter that path
Is itself the teacher within one's own being
Only by learning and observing can one truly know.
To speak of good and bad without learning is foolish
To those with deep aspiration, even a thousand times
One should teach with deep compassion and skill
Abandoning the self and asking others to learn
This becomes the foundation for later mastery
In tea procedure, do not forget weakness and be merely strong
Do not make the manners vulgar through self-styled ways
Do not think that tea procedure consists only of strength
Let the strong be weak, the light be heavy
I hear that tea procedure exists in thin tea,
Those who think it exists in thick tea are mistaken
In thick tea, abandon technique and with single focus
Do not scatter your breath worrying about the serving
In thick tea, let the hot water be hot, and the serving still
Without being thin, without lumps

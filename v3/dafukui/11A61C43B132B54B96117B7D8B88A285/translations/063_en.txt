One: A certain person living in Shinyashiki who was devoted entirely to military arts was illiterate, so whenever there were official notices from the head clerk, he would go to his neighbor's house through the back alley over the fence behind his gate. After exchanging seasonal greetings in familiar common language, he would indirectly ask, "Today another serious official notice has come - what do you think of it?" The neighbor, feeling sorry for him while understanding his true situation, would say, "It's nothing serious. Since the dry weather continues, it's just a notice from the inspector to be careful with fire." The man would respond with a puzzled expression, "Fire precautions and such - isn't each one extremely serious?" Then saying "I see," he would grasp the meaning and quickly leave. This became his regular practice, and the neighbor kindly taught him in this way.

One: This is not about a samurai but a person of lower status, yet illiteracy is such a regrettable matter that even one's own children mock it. A certain illiterate father was shown the character for "sake" (alcohol) by his child, who asked, "This is grandpa's favorite thing - what character is this?" The father scolded, "How dare you show such an improper character before your parent!"

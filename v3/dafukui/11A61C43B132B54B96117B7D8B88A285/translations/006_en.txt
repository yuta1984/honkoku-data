Those items should be recorded in catalogs and kept, and when occasions arise for exhibitions,
they should be brought out to gatherings, and when finished, stored as treasures in one's home again.
Also, in later years, when unavoidable circumstances require transferring them to others,
arrangements should be made as described above. It is inevitable that some
may have been sold or lost by now, but that cannot be helped. However, if we remain ashamed before society and keep them
hidden,
the distinguished family names and treasured heirloom items
will completely disappear for all future generations unless we record them in detail now.
Therefore, we should thoroughly investigate and compile without omission the provenance and catalogs of items that were possessed,
and for those who possess treasured
rare vessels and antiquities regardless of inherited provenance, not only former samurai but people from all walks of life should be

searched and recorded in detail to create a single volume,
which should be offered to Sakae Shrine, and furthermore printed,
so that future generations may know that the former domain had such retainers
and that there were people who possessed such treasures.
If exhibitions could be held from time to time, would this not be excellent?
This would surely accord with divine will, and the legacy of each family would remain
imperishable for ten thousand generations, and the spirits of ancestors would achieve their
cherished wishes, I believe.

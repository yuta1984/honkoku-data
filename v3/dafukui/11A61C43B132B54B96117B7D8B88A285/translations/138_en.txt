Records of Fukui　Household Transfer of the Onko-chō
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Testament
　For the three-year period of years 14, 15, and 16, this old man has completed the groundwork.
　Regarding the repair of somewhat inconsistent portions among the articles, which I have long
　requested, concerning the editorial insertions for the compilation, as is appropriate,
　I will consult with Professor Yamamoto Shōji and arrange things well regardless of circumstances,
　and will request consultation as soon as possible.
One: After the above is completed, for this year's portion, in addition to what I have recently
　recorded on the draft paper,
　please provide any written insertions without fail by next spring, March or April.

If you intend to display jars and such in the tokonoma alcove
They should be displayed before the flowers
For incense containers, famous pieces and such
Do not put firing ceramics directly in them, I hear
In summer, for charcoal use vegetable baskets and metal fire chopsticks
With kyara wood, incense containers, and ceramics, know this
In summer, water vessels should also be metal ones
In winter, use lacquered true katakuchi pitchers
If the lid rest has three legs, place two legs
Facing toward the front, keep this in mind

For water jars on two-mat or three-mat arrangements
First place them at the ninth line, this is the rule
For tea cloths, the dimensions, cloth width, and horizontal width also
(Know that one shaku horizontally is five sun by metal measure)
For wiping cloths, nine sun to one shaku, and additionally
Some people make them eight sun to nine sun
The interior of thin boards is one shaku three sun five bu
The horizontal width is nine sun, I hear
Thin boards should be seventeen lines from the floor frame
Or eighteen to nineteen lines is also good

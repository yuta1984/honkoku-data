　　　　　Regarding the March Hina Festival and Hamaya (demon-breaking bow)
First, the March seasonal festival was traditionally celebrated on the day of the snake (mi) in the early part of the month, which is why it was called the Jōmi no Sekku (Festival of the First Snake Day). At some point, however, it became fixed on the third day. Court dolls (dairi-bina) are displayed on tiered platforms, along with naked dolls and various other miniature accessories arranged on the tiers. Sacred sake, diamond-shaped rice cakes, confections, steamed buns, and all manner of feast items are offered without exception. Peach and willow fresh flowers and various crafted decorations are also hung. Since this is fundamentally a festival for girls, families of high status include these as part of the bridal trousseau according to their social standing. For the celebration of a daughter's first childbirth, regardless of social rank, it is customary for the natal family to send these items.

An Example of How a Family's Rise and Fall Depends on the Master's Understanding

When I was young, there was an elderly merchant who had been on intimate terms with my late father. His father was the son of a porter who would go out to the riverbank wharves to handle the loading and unloading of ships, stand in the marketplace shops, and make his living transporting goods, working with sincerity and honesty. The man himself had served at a wealthy household in the Katamachi area from his youth, persevered, and eventually became the head clerk. When his term of service was complete, he asked for leave, received capital, established his own household, combined it with the savings his parent had accumulated, and took up the pawnbroking business as his occupation. He rose to become a person of comfortable means, but he never forgot his humble origins and always bore in mind the debt of gratitude for his parent's hard work.

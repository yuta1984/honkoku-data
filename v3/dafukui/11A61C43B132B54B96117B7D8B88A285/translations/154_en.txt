In a six-tatami room with permanent alcoves built on all four sides, like a kotatsu tower with bucket and basket where one sees not, hears not, speaks not, even when called as "monkey child," it does not move. Thinking it better that such a monkey not go anywhere, with not just three strands but a completely bald head, using the foolish wisdom of a monkey retainer, the troubles of spring in the year of the Dog (not the Monkey) are things of the past. Now, taking the beginning of the harmonious first month as auspicious, with only thoughts of the essential methods for where the unaware monkey should go and contemplation of this historical collection, the monkey contentedly withdraws and enjoys himself.

Like Taigong Wang who withdrew in such a manner, the old man's sentiment—
Who knows this joyful heart of the monkey

Seventy-two-year-old man
In the clearly governed nineteenth year [Meiji 19, 1886]　Tomoyoshi

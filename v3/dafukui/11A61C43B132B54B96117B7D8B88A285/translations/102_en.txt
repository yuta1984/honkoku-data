The tea masters of that time each made their own.
　　During some military campaign, Lord Hosokawa Yūsai was deployed in formation when he was looking around in a bundle of bamboo to carve a tea scoop, and at that moment projectiles were fired from the enemy camp, scraping through the skylight.

However, as times changed again, the genuine works of the aforementioned famous houses came to surpass even the renowned craftsmanship of Kiyomizu Ninsei in value, and the raku pottery houses continued their traditions. Tea scoops too, depending on their makers, came to exceed even pure gold in value. While this appears to be merely trivial amusement and recreational cultivation, even during the turbulent and violent times of civil war, we occasionally hear accounts of gatherings. Furthermore, in the era of the former shogunate, for reasons still unknown to us, several tea masters from Uji received stipends, and in Edo there were numerous official tea masters. During the transport of new tea, they would display banners called "honorable tea jars" with strict authority, clearing the way with staffs. Without distinction between daimyo and court nobles, they enforced mandatory dismounting from horses and palanquins for all, made feudal lords step aside from the road and wait while avoiding encounters, and even officials who appeared to be of low rank wielded unexpected power.
　　A brief question: Calling this significant matter "not worth a cup of tea" seems to be some kind of mistake - how peculiar.

Nasu Harusuke, Oyama and others have changed the established duties, and the people of
Hitachi and Shimotsuke provinces do not observe the law. Because of this, retainers of various houses are being disrespectful and excessive.
This is both a source of discontent and a difficulty in governing this territory.
I hope that you will give even stricter orders to Tsuna and others from your side, so that there will be no disturbances as per established precedent. With fear and respect.

As a celebratory gift for the Chrysanthemum Festival, I am
sending one kosode robe. This is most joyous. Furthermore, Sakakibara
Minbu-no-taiyu will speak about this matter, so I will not go into details.
With fear and respect.

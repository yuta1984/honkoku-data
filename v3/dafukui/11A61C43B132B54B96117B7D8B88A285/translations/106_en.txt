In any case, to learn the proper serving technique
Make thick tea again and again to know it well
When whisking tea, pay careful attention to the tea whisk
Do not let it strike strongly against the outside of the tea bowl
At other places, after putting in tea with the tea scoop
Not striking the rim of the tea bowl is also proper etiquette
Take the lid of a chadutsu by grasping it from the side
The tea scoop should be placed in a rounded manner
For a natsume, take the lid by lifting it from above
The tea scoop should be placed at an angle
If the thin tea container has maki-e lacquer decoration or carving
One should learn the proper and reverse orientations when making tea
If making thick tea with a natsume, by all means
When putting on the lid, wipe it with the fukusa cloth
A katatsuki is the same as a chadutsu
One does not place fingers on its exterior
For bunrin, nasu, round jars, and natsume too
I hear one should hold them with fingers supporting the bottom
When handling a taikai, I hear the custom is
To hide the thumb to one side

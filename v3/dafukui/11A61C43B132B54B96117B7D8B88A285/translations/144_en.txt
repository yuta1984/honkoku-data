The family all came out to greet me, exchanging familiar greetings as usual. They helped carry my bundle, walking stick, and umbrella, and guided me to a suitable room. They prepared and brought out a complete set of furnishings: clothing rack, bath shelf, boxes, brazier, iron kettle, water jar, tea bowls, teapot, and other household items. Since I was there primarily for recuperation, I found their care and instructions somewhat bothersome, so I left everything to the inn's management and enjoyed soaking in the hot springs. After dinner, I bathed again. There were few guests at any of the inns, and I knew no one in the area, so I felt lonely, hanging my head and wondering if there might be someone to talk with. Along the road I had traveled today, my heart had opened to the snow and flowers, but now I wondered if it might close again. It seemed as if the moon, with whom I had a deep familiarity spanning many lifetimes, was graciously reflecting its sacred light together with me into the hot spring waters.

Does the moon see me as aged and shine upon me thus?
Alone and lonely at this Yamashiro inn

Having written down such random thoughts from my journey, I fell into deep sleep from the fatigue of the long road and passed the night. Fortunately, there was a notice posted that dharma sessions of my sect would be held at the local Senkoji Temple until the fifth day, so I attended without fail each day.

Section of Miscellaneous Stories
1. Since ancient times, there have been numerous miscellaneous tales of inspiring stories, strange tales, ghost stories, and humorous anecdotes. However, I defer to the excellent writings of my predecessors and will not record them here now. As the compilation proceeds, it is my intention to present them based on the principle of "learning from the past to understand the present" (onko chishin). Therefore, I have written out a few examples to compare different methods of supplementary recording. My hope is that in the future, without being bound by chronological order, these stories will be collected by category as much as possible and continued to be recorded for generations to come.

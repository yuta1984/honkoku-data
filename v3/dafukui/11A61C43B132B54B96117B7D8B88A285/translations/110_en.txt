When displaying the Kokin-shū collection in the tokonoma alcove
Do not display other poetry books, I hear
When viewing books with outer titles
Show the title to the host before opening
When displaying incense boxes or feather whisks
Examine carefully whether to use right or left feathers
At tea gatherings where famous tea bowls appear
Know that the etiquette changes somewhat
For morning tea gatherings in the sukiya, use andon lamps
For evening gatherings and such, place tankei lamps

When adding oil to lamps, add plenty
Know this as proper consideration so guests have sufficient light
There are two types of lamps: in and yō
Morning uses in (shadow), evening uses yō (light)
At ancient evening gatherings, in the tokonoma
There were neither hanging scrolls nor flowers, I hear
In winter, with charcoal in the fukube, handled fire chopsticks
Wooden incense containers and ceramics, I hear
In paintings too, there are left-facing, right-facing, and front-facing
However, it also depends on the convenience of the tokonoma

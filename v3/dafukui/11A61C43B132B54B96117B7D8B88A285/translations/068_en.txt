He deeply expressed his gratitude, and within about three days thereafter, he frequently visited, appropriately offering toys and sweets to the sons, daughters, and young children, and treats as gifts. He devoted himself to being pleasant even to the young retainers, servants, and pet cats, eventually becoming a trusted regular visitor. He was asked to help with all manner of tasks and even shopping, but he worked honestly and faithfully without flattery or superficiality. Believing the time had come to reveal the true purpose of his aspirations, he requested a formal audience with all present and spoke: "I am from a village in Nyu District in Echizen Province. Three of us companions made an agreement as friends when we came here - that unless we achieved outstanding success, we would never face each other again, and then we parted. I wonder what became of the other two. I have been accepted into the kurokuwagumi (construction corps), and I earnestly wish to work diligently in service through proper channels. I have been troubled by this for some time, but being originally from a distant rural area with no connections or acquaintances to rely upon, I devised a plan involving drinking alcohol (which I am poor at), leading to receiving your benevolent consideration this time. I humbly request that through your further mercy, you understand my sincere heart and graciously provide your good offices in various ways." When he explained this in detail, the deputies were extremely impressed and immediately reported this to their lord.

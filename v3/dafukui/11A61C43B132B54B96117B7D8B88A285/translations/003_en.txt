Regarding the founding of Fukui Castle, Sakae-no-miya-no-kami (Yuki Hideyasu) was
the second son of Toshogu (Tokugawa Ieyasu) and the elder brother of Shogun Hidetada,
and being particularly endowed with both literary and military virtues, many
remnants of various prestigious families sought to be taken into his service out of admiration for his威德. Moreover,
Chancellor Tadamasa (Matsudaira Tadamasa) inherited his legacy, and his military prowess flourished.
Being magnanimous and benevolent, those who had distinguished themselves with renowned
military achievements at Osaka and other places likewise gathered together, and many
parties with distinguished lineages were taken into service. However, from the first year of Kan'ei onward, they were gradually
assigned to branch families, and furthermore, due to the calamitous incident of the third year of Jokyo, they were dismissed from service.

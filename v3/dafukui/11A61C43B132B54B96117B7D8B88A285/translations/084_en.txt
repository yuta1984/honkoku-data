low, wondering "What will he do?" when the merchant took out a large furoshiki wrapping cloth and, looking troubled and embarrassed, said "Please, could you give me two or three rice straw sacks and some rope?" The samurai felt sorry for him and brought these out. The merchant skillfully wrapped the broken jar in them, said "Thank you very much," put down the three mon, bowed politely, shouldered his bundle and left.

Afterward, the samurai said to his household: "The merchant was so afraid of us samurai and our firm words that he was forced to buy it anyway. How pitiful for him!" He was laughing proudly when a neighborhood child came and said: "I followed that man who bought the broken jar earlier to see what he would do with it. At the corner over there, he threw it into the ditch, took only the rope and straw sacks, and quickly went off somewhere."

Upon hearing this, the samurai was greatly shocked and chagrined, but there was nothing to be done. He could only grit his teeth in regret.

The old saying "One becomes wise through one's trade" is indeed apt!

Thin boards also depend on the size of the tokonoma alcove, and again
They vary according to the utensils used

For flower container hanging nails, from the floor mat
Three shaku three sun, or two sun five bu as well

If flower containers come in different sizes, match them accordingly
Removing the metal fittings and hammering is also about metal

For bamboo nails, drive them with the bark side up, I hear
Driving them with the bark side down is a mistake

For three nails, from the center nail to both sides
Leave a space of seven sun three bu when driving them

To hang three hanging scrolls, hang the center one first
Then hang the right scroll, followed by the left scroll

When hanging scroll paintings, for the return suspension
Leave even one bu of space, so I hear

Depending on the painting, there may be much attention to flowers
There are no grasses and flowers that stand against the wind

When serving tea to people returning from flower viewing
It's not unusual - place both flowers and paintings

For impromptu occasions when guests arrive unexpectedly
Keep your heart calm and be especially careful with the details

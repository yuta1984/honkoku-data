The measures in question: using hanging [scales] for rough measurement, they measure to 5 to 6 shō. Accordingly, without [rough measurement], using hanging scales, it was established as the official regulation of 5 to 3 shō 6 gō.

When we investigated whether there might be others in this town who know about the matter of measures, these two men spoke as follows.

There are no others who know about this matter. When we inquired of Honda Jōtetsu, Ōtani Igiemon, Yamana Shōsuke and others, they had no clear recollection. When we asked Seki Matajūrō, he also did not know for certain. However, in Echigo they use only Kyoto measures. Those measures are still at Matajūrō's place. Regarding the situation in Echigo, Igiemon said the same thing.

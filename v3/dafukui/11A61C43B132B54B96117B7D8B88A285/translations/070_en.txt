He answered that he would pay and hand it over. So they said, "Then tomorrow when we leave the castle, let's go out early to meet him and arrange something special." The chief attendant and others conspired together, borrowing everything - swords (long and short), shoulder garments, hakama, appropriate clothing, tabi socks, and carrying items. The next morning, as soon as the attendants returned, they immediately prepared everything, chose an appropriate location, had him ride in a palanquin, formed a proper procession from there, and paraded around all the places he had wished to see. When he said he was finally satisfied, they had him dismount at an inconspicuous spot near Hirakawa Gate. He expressed deep gratitude and immediately handed over all his savings as promised. Everyone was greatly delighted and strictly forbade each other from speaking of this to others. As usual, they waited for their master at the dismounting area's bench, and after returning to the residence, the group conspired to buy sake, side dishes, and each person's favorite foods, planning to drink secretly in the large room of the continuous row houses. However, they gradually became intoxicated and excited, forgetting their initial agreement, and began singing, chanting festival narratives, and joruri ballads at the top of their voices. From the inner quarters, someone peered through the window wondering "what's going on?" and listened in. What could they not know? They shouted even louder, telling the whole story of the day's events. The master's anger was beyond measure - he immediately summoned his deputy and ordered that the chief attendant, close attendants, foot soldiers, and all the servant staff be dismissed entirely and expelled from the premises, causing great confusion and panic.

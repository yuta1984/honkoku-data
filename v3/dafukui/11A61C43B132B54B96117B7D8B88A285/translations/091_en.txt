Dumplings shaped like sacred jewels with their pointed tips colored with red pigment would be placed on earthenware vessels as offerings. When the favorable smallpox had successfully concluded, bamboo-leaf water would be sprinkled over them, and rice with red beans would be offered to the okiagari koboshi dolls, which were then worshipped and sent down the river in celebration. Of course, the methods of worship would vary from country to country and place to place, but in our locality, this was the customary practice for favorable smallpox.

However, while some cases ended with nothing more than playful activities throughout, many children died from contracting this severe illness. Even in the mildest cases, not one person escaped without scars, and in severe cases, marks would remain on the face, hands, feet, and entire body. In some cases, the eyes, nose, mouth, and other features would become distorted, and in the most severe cases, the individual pox would merge into one continuous mass of sores, with scabs falling off like a crab's shell, leaving bald, shiny scars behind. Even those born with beautiful faces would have their appearance changed, and many suffered such disfigurement. I don't know about other places, but in our locality, depending on their skin complexion, people called them "white pockmarked," "red pockmarked," or "crab pockmarked."

Under these circumstances, in Kaei 4, year of the boar (1851), we heard that Dutch people had brought over books on the principles and effectiveness of smallpox vaccination along with cowpox seedlings from the West. Immediately, the renowned physician of that time, Mr. Kasahara Ryōsaku, petitioned our lord, traveled to Nagasaki port, and returned after learning the techniques of medical treatment and methods of inoculation (marginal note: He was said to be the foremost leader in the three capitals and various provinces).

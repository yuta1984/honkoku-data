From the first year of Genji, the year of Kinoe-ne (1864), before the Meiji Restoration, as shown in a separate section on economic depression, domain paper money also underwent frequent changes. The government also issued gold certificates and newly minted gold and silver, causing rice prices to fluctuate even more dramatically. Since the chronological order is also questionable, I investigated gold and silver matters through the Komaya family, and rice prices through traditional rice dealers and sake brewers, writing down the details as thoroughly as possible. Furthermore, I entrusted the continuation of records regarding commercial law and products to respective companies, so that without negligence I could compile the annual economic conditions to serve as a precious mirror for posterity, making known the circumstances of each period until the end of time, hoping for the ever-greater prosperity of our domain - this is the intent with which I begin this writing.

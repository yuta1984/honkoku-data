They would not utter a single word to anyone, and when told "not needed," they would simply depart. I do not yet know the spiritual principles behind this sect's practices, but their attire consisted of plain kimono with large round head coverings (hand towels) tied around their heads, five-stripe kesa (Buddhist stoles) with ivory hanging cords made of black satin, shakuhachi flutes in black velvet bags worn like swords at their sides, and deep sedge hats on their heads. Those traveling to other provinces wore white cotton hand guards, hakama trousers, and leggings, carrying bone willow wrapped in large furoshiki cloth bundles on their backs.

These were called komusō (emptiness monks) or also komusō (straw mat monks), and were said to be hideaways for samurai. However, around the time of the Meiji Restoration, by imperial decree,

these followers of the Fuke sect were abolished.

Regarding this, there is one story. In our domain, there was a sword instructor named Yokoyama Jūrōbei, who among his generation was exceptionally skilled in his profession and had an honorable reputation, but who also favored the shakuhachi and became accomplished in that way. Many practitioners from neighboring provinces heard of him and came in great numbers. It was said that through his playing style, he could even conduct distant musical dialogues immediately. This Yokoyama's residence was located in the former Amakusa-chō, at a place that had the outer moat's earthworks as its back entrance, continuing from the Jizō-chō gate. When practitioners wandering around the area of the inner moat, near the former construction group residences, heard that he was skilled, they would immediately go to the rear earthworks.

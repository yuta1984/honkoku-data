Hori Echigo-no-kami Tadatoshi served Tokugawa Ieyasu. During the Battle of Sekigahara in Keichō 5 (1600), when an uprising occurred in Echigo Province, it was completely pacified through the efforts of the Hori clan. At this time, Tadatoshi's retainer Hori Kenmotsu Naomasa, his eldest son Utanosuke Naofumi, and his second son Tango-no-kami Naoyori made extraordinary efforts, and as a result of Ieyasu's special consideration, they were granted exceptional domains. However, after Kenmotsu Naomasa's death, his sons Naofumi and Naoyori fought over power, and Naoyori went to Suruga to file complaints against his lord Echigo-no-kami Tadatoshi and his elder brother Kenmotsu Naofumi. When Ieyasu heard of this and became angered by the unrest in that province, in the intercalary second month of Keichō 15 (1610), he placed Hori Echigo-no-kami Tadatoshi under the custody of Torii Sakyō-no-suke Tadamasa, lord of Iwaki in Ōshū, and confiscated his domain. The chief retainer Hori Kenmotsu Naofumi was exiled to Mogami in Ushū. Thus, the main Hori family line was extinguished.

Shinzaemon Narishige was the son of Echigo-no-kami Tadatoshi by a concubine. When Tadatoshi died in exile, his concubine, of the Kushima family, had relatives near Tsuchiura in Hitachi Province, so she moved there and gave birth the following year.

A protective sword that Hidemasasa had reportedly received from Oda Nobunaga was given by Tadatoshi to this concubine, and it is still passed down today.

However, being the child of an exile, he was raised in secrecy, and after reaching adulthood, he went to Edo. There, having maternal connections with the hatamoto Kitami Kyūdayū, he petitioned Matsudaira Mitsumichi and Shinzaemon Narishige was summoned into service with the Fukui domain.

In the 4th year of Jōkyō (1687) during the reign of Lord Yoshishina (Matsudaira Yoshishina), he was granted an inherited stipend.

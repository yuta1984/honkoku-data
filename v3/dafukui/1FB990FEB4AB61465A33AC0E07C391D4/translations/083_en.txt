1. Regarding the Nishi Honganji sectarian dispute, while this has been handled with exceptional compassion until now, instead there have been selfish acts committed without fear, which is extremely improper conduct. Particularly on the 27th and 29th of last month, large crowds gathered at Chōkei Temple in Kida-machi in the castle town,

engaging in violence and causing disturbances in the castle town. This constitutes a serious matter against public authority as it violates domain law. This time, security personnel have been deployed, and henceforth, should there be even the slightest violence, strict measures will be taken regardless of whether in domain territory or other territories. Naturally, this has been communicated to all relevant parties.

1. Gathering of ten or twenty people for consultation, regardless of the matter, has long been prohibited, so no form of factional assembly shall be permitted.

1. Regardless of the matter, circular letters and verbal communications are absolutely forbidden. Should such occur, within that village, those who circulated or communicated such messages shall be apprehended, and without forwarding the message, immediate report shall be made to the local administrative office. Should there be negligence, even if discovered later, punishment will certainly be imposed.

1. Except for official business and unavoidable matters, peasants gathering by mutual invitation is strictly prohibited. Village officials shall implement control measures.

1. Regarding the sectarian dispute, there have been instances of gathering at liaison offices in the castle town for consultation, but since sectarian matters do not involve domain administration, no restrictions were imposed until now. However, such disruptive matters do involve domain administration and cannot be overlooked. Henceforth, gathering even individually at liaison offices for consultation is absolutely forbidden. Should there be unavoidable business requiring consultation, names must be registered in advance as instructed to the liaison offices. Naturally, large gatherings are not permitted under any circumstances.

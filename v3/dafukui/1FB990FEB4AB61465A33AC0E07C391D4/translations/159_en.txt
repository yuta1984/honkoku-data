To All Monthly Duty Officers
○This time, loans have been authorized from both the Ofuda-sho (Certificate Office) and Goshui-kata offices as financial assistance for the retainers. This time, exceptionally large amounts of silver are being lent, with repayment temporarily set at interest only, with the specific intention of enabling households to continue functioning. Also, while frugality has been ordered repeatedly, clothing, social gatherings, and gift-giving have become extremely lax in recent years, so the previously issued directives are being reissued with renewed emphasis. Henceforth, frugality must be strictly observed without misunderstanding, and household finances must be maintained through any means of economizing. It is ordered that this matter be conveyed.
However, the allocation of loans will be communicated later by the Accounting Office.
January 20th - Down to all subordinates
The aforementioned loan amount is at a rate of 700 monme per 100 koku, with interest of 8 shu per month starting from the sixth month of this Year of the Ox, temporarily interest-only payments.

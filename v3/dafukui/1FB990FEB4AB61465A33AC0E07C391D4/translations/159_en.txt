January 15th

To all monthly duty officers
○This time, as financial assistance to the retainer class, loans will be offered through both the Ofuda-sho and Goshui-kata offices. This time, exceptionally large amounts of silver will be loaned, and for repayment, only interest payments will be required for the time being, with the sole purpose of enabling the continuation of financial management. Furthermore, although frugality has been repeatedly mandated, clothing, social gatherings, and gift-giving have become extremely lax in recent years. Therefore, the previous directives are being reissued with renewed emphasis. Henceforth, frugality must be strictly observed without any misunderstanding, and financial management must be continued through every possible means of economizing. You are ordered to communicate this matter.
However, regarding the loan allocation method, details will be communicated later by the accounting office.
May 20th　Down to all subordinates
The above loan amount is at a rate of 700 monme per 100 koku, with interest of 8 shu per month starting from the 6th month of this Year of the Ox, with only interest payments for the time being.

The root cause of this matter is their failure to follow the teachings of Honganji Temple. This time, through the authority of the government, we wish to make them submit by sincerely explaining the consequences and benefits so that they will comply with Honganji's teachings, and then have them depart for the capital. However, since these ignorant people only petition for their lord's mercy and compassion, it would be inappropriate to give harsh orders, so we humbly request that you grant a temporary postponement. The above.

　When this was communicated as above, on the 16th of the same month, instructions were issued through an official notice and warning document. The content of said official notice is as follows:
　　　As described in the document, causing difficulties upon receiving summons from the magistrate's office is improper conduct, so we believe orders for immediate departure should be given. However, if those summoned delay and large numbers gather to engage in forceful petitions, use the attached document to explain the consequences as thoroughly as possible and arrange for their dispersal. If even then they do not heed the warnings and persist in their willful ways, escalating to violence and becoming unmanageable, then depending on the circumstances, it would be appropriate for the domain lord to handle the situation as he sees fit, whether through arrests or dispersing them with firearms.
　　　　　　　　　2nd month of the Monkey Year

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Administrative Head
○Among the Nishi Honganji sect branch temples and followers who were summoned from Edo previously, summon the follower representatives and others to each office accordingly, communicate the attached instructions, and thoroughly explain the consequences.
　　　Previously, regarding the summons to Edo of clergy and followers, there were earnest petitions from both monks and laypeople, which led to various deliberations. Although this is an extremely serious matter, special efforts were made from your end, and repeated requests were made for some postponement of the summons. However, the government's decision is that obstructing summons from the magistrate's office is improper conduct, and they should depart immediately. Those who still do not comply after being warned of consequences should be dealt with strictly, as ordered. Furthermore, since written instructions regarding the method of explaining consequences have been provided, copies are hereby distributed. Everyone must understand these without exception and return them after review. The fact that such written instructions have been provided by the magistrate's office makes this an even more serious matter. If the content of these instructions is properly understood, it should be considered most gracious. From now on, those summoned must depart without fail, and followers must not make various excuses. If there are any misunderstandings, the strict measures ordered by the government will inevitably be implemented. This would be unfortunate for the domain's people, so it is ordered that consequences be thoroughly explained to prevent any misunderstandings.
　　　　　Attachment: Document explaining consequences to be communicated to temple followers
　　　You have traditionally been followers of Nishi Honganji Temple, and since you have continuously maintained the teachings inherited from the founder through teaching documents from successive head abbots, or from the head scholars of the main temple and other subsidiary temples, there should be nothing improper in this.
　　　However, since before the Year of the Rat, religious doctrine has become divided into two paths throughout the provinces, making it difficult for the head abbot's direct teachings to reach everyone. When appeals were made for official investigation by the magistrate's office, the magistrate's office conducted investigations again, and after inquiring with the head abbot based on the claims of this doctrinal division...

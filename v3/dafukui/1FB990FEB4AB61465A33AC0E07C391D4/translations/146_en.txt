1. Bunka 11, Year of the Dog (1814)
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Administrative Chiefs
○Regarding the tribute silver for silk and cocoons that was announced as domain policy in previous years, it has come to our attention that in recent years this has been gradually decreasing and being neglected, which is unacceptable. Therefore, from this year of the dog, the administrative method has been reformed and the following has been ordered. The individual records and origins of those handling silk and cocoons should be investigated and reported.
1. Those engaged in silk trading, regardless of the volume of their business, shall pay 5 monme of silver per person per year as tribute silver, and trading licenses shall be issued to them
1. Those who wish to become cocoon wholesalers shall pay 30 monme of silver per person per year as tribute silver, and trading licenses shall be issued to them
1. Cocoon middlemen shall pay 3 monme of silver per person per year as tribute silver, and trading licenses shall be issued to them
　　However, collection of these payments shall be made during summer and autumn when silk and cocoons are handled. If payments fall behind, trading licenses shall be confiscated
1. Those who handle both silk and cocoons must apply for both types of trading licenses
1. Silk brokers shall not enter rural areas to make direct purchases, but must purchase through the nearest wholesalers
1. Anyone other than wholesalers, even middlemen, must never make direct sales to people from other provinces or domains
　　However, purchasing from other domains is acceptable

1. In the castle town and the four surrounding districts, annual administrators and supervisors shall be appointed to ensure strict handling of accounts and all matters. If anyone is found to have misunderstood their duties, this must be reported immediately
　As announced above, this has been newly decreed from this year of the dog, so individual records of those applying for trading licenses should be investigated and reported. Of course, handling silk and cocoons without possessing a trading license is absolutely forbidden, so each person should be instructed to avoid any misunderstanding.

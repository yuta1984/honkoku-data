○As everyone knows, the domain's finances have long been in difficulty. The year before last, in the Year of the Dog, due to the great disaster in Edo, construction expenses were covered through half-reduction of retainer rice loans, commercial taxes from towns and villages, and other new financial arrangements.

　The upper residence and Reiganjima construction and residential quarters were completed,
　and Their Lordships were satisfied. However, since hand tools and daily-use implements were completely destroyed by fire, replacement tools had to be gradually procured, which also required enormous expenses. Both internal and external financing became excessive, making cash flow extremely difficult. Furthermore, since the half-reduction repayment by retainers has continued for a long time since the Year of the Ox, reports of extreme hardship and complete lack of liquidity in both towns and villages are frequently communicated from the administration. However, having no other means of assistance, the half-reduction rice loan exemption was unavoidably granted. This disrupted financial planning and caused delays in debt repayment, making it unavoidable to request extensions on loans from others, though this is regrettable. Therefore, arrangements were made for river works silver and rice certificate-backed financing that had been handled by offices in previous years. While this is an important funding source, due to the truly unavoidable circumstances mentioned above, repayment of the remaining silver amount was requested to be extended to thirty annual installments starting this year. Though this will cause hardship for the creditors, it is hoped they will arrange matters favorably.

○Regarding the town and village cooperative loan societies established in the previous Year of the Sheep, repayment had been twice yearly until now, but since both internal and external financing arrangements have been discontinued, these cooperative loan societies will also hereafter make repayment once yearly at 650 ryō each. Although there are precedents of reducing various debts, given the special nature of these cooperative arrangements, it is difficult to request the same from others. After careful investigation, this arrangement was decided upon, so though it will cause hardship,

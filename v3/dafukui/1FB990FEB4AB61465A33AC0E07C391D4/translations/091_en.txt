○Regarding the Korean envoy's visit to Tsushima next year (Mi year), this was previously ordered by the Shogunate, and at that time documents from the Shogunate's official notices were distributed.
Regarding this matter, tribute money was to be collected from each subordinate domain and submitted to the higher authorities. However, due to the fire at the Tokiwabashi residence in the year before last (Tora year) and the flood damage in last year (U year), a request was made to postpone the tribute payment. However, the flood damage was not recognized by the Shogunate, but due to the fire damage, both the domain tax and national tax payments were postponed for three years from this Tatsu year to the coming Uma year, and from the Hitsuji year onward, payments according to the prescribed rate shall be ordered. This matter should be communicated to each subordinate domain.

1. There are occasionally village areas that have been granted various tax exemptions since ancient times due to special circumstances. Should these portions be excluded?

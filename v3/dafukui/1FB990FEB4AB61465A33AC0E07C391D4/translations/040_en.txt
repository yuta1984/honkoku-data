　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To all monthly duty officers
1. Due to continued reductions in rice loans to retainers from previous years, they have gradually fallen into hardship, causing His Lordship great concern. However, having no other means of assistance available, this year a 50% reduction in rice loan repayment has been granted. While this further strains the domain's finances, it has been reported that retainers are particularly struggling until the end of this year, so orders have been issued to discuss earnestly any possible assistance measures, however small. However, as mentioned above, with the one-year reduction in half-payments and excessive expenditure of reserve funds this year, things cannot proceed as His Lordship wishes. Therefore, it has been ordered that for those in particular difficulty who petition, loans may be granted from the special purpose silver fund. Furthermore, regarding frugality, this has been repeatedly ordered, so it will not be specifically mentioned again, but it has been heard that some inappropriate conduct occurs despite general financial difficulties and lack of flexibility, so orders have been issued to avoid such misunderstandings.

　　The above treatment for weddings applies only to formal ceremonies

1. For childbirth:
　　Exchange delicacies one box worth twenty monme silver, but with lacquered stand, three sho of sake one barrel, but celebratory Ikawa sake
　　The above applies only to childbirth of the moneylender's wife and eldest son's wife

1. For illness and travel inquiries as sympathy visits, items worth about fifteen monme shall be the limit

　　Incense offering of one hundred hiki gold, one set of steamer baskets, worth ten monme for mourning period inquiries
　　There shall be no such treatment for legitimate grandsons and below

1. Giving domain products during hot and cold seasons shall continue as before. When magistrates change, souvenir treatment shall be lighter than before

1. The same applies when financial officers change

1. The annual New Year sixth day practice of providing sake and soup followed by meals at external venues shall be discontinued

1. The annual New Year practice of giving one box of delicacies to each moneylender shall be discontinued

1. The recent practice of senior retainers entertaining moneylenders and their sons at the Reiganjima tea house shall be discontinued
　　However, this practice originally arose because certain moneylenders worked diligently in procurement matters. Previously, only Mitani Shichiroemon and Ishii Taroemon were invited to the senior retainer's quarters for meals. Recently this became general practice, with all eight moneylenders and their sons now attending. In any case, the previous entertainment shall be discontinued, and only those who work with particular diligence shall be entertained at the senior retainer's quarters as before

1. For the Sanno festival and Kanda festival, as these occur on the fifteenth with monthly attendance, they shall continue as before, though during the term limit they shall be handled more lightly

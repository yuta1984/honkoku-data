　This should be understood accordingly　　Separate document　　　　　　　Officials

○While austerity investigations had been previously ordered, with the recent assignment of assistance duties, financial circulation has become increasingly difficult in all matters, and His Lordship is extremely troubled by this crucial matter of how future payments can be managed. Originally, the financial foundation is thin, and managing within the limits of tax collection has never been possible since ancient times. However, this time, with special consideration, it is ordered that a plan be formulated to match the tax collection amounts. Regarding this, extraordinary reductions will be gradually announced for both high and low ranks during the ten-year term, so this should be understood accordingly.

Furthermore, as stated in the main text, regardless of previous practices, any ideas for matters that could lead to economies should be reported. Additionally, regarding official duties, for example starting with guard duty rotations, if there are items that individuals notice could lead to convenient economies, these should be privately communicated to the inspectors, and after examination, matters that do not cause interference may be excused during the term period. Of course, since these relate to the relevant departments, it is ordered that this be thoroughly communicated to avoid misunderstandings.

○Due to the fire loss of the main residence building at the Edo upper mansion, half-reduced borrowed rice has been unavoidably ordered. Regarding the aftermath of the long-term half-reduced borrowed rice, and since town and rural service money has been ordered, the situation of particular financial difficulty and hardship has reached His Lordship's ears, causing him concern. Therefore, following the precedent of the previous Year of the Dragon, loan certificates will be issued upon application by those in difficulty. Further details will be communicated by the magistrates.

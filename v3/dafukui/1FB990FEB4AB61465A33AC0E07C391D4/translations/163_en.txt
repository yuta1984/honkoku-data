Four-District Magistrate
1. Regarding river flood control construction, until now construction has been ordered only for unavoidable locations, but from this Ox year forward, with particularly strict economies and regardless of previous practices, construction should be postponed as much as possible except for urgent repairs. Of course, even for unavoidable construction sites, bamboo and timber estimates should be carefully examined and detailed estimate books prepared. Also, from this Ox year forward, river flood control silver should be newly established as an annual silver amount allocation.
　　However, the matter of this silver amount should be communicated after investigation.
1. Regarding repairs of rural roads and bridges, other lower-rank laborers' wages, and highway road and bridge repair expenses, from the previous Monkey year to last Rat year, a five-year average silver amount with discount remaining silver amount has been allocated from this Ox year as fixed assessments, so arrangements should be made to handle affairs within this silver amount.
　　However, bamboo and timber matters should also be allocated as fixed assessments with discounts within the five-year average.
1. Irrigation channel construction matters should be the same as for river flood control magistrates. Of course, construction site expenses, bamboo and timber, etc., should also be specially reduced to enable estimate book preparation.
1. Regarding requests for rice and silver loans and assistance in rural areas, until now unavoidable villages have been reluctantly approved, but further regardless of previous practices, among impoverished villages under each jurisdiction, efforts should be made to explain well so that such requests do not arise.
1. Since rural impoverishment has been reported in recent years, falcon hunting ground road construction should be economized as much as possible.

Regarding auxiliary laborers, until now 10,000 people per year have been allocated, but during absence years this should be managed with about 5,000 people. However, depending on the roads, if construction is postponed for one year, it may conversely increase costs, so combining residence years and absence years, with 20,000 people over two years, regular and emergency major and minor repairs should be accomplished through careful consideration.
　　However, beyond this number of people, advancing next year's allocation for carried-over construction is not permitted.
　These matters should be carefully handled with due consideration.

1. For fixed contract work other than construction office arrangements, a 20% reduction from previous silver amounts is ordered. Also, regarding hedge wrapping, while this has been contracted until now, the wrapping work is temporarily suspended.
1. Regarding fixed distributions to casual workers and daily payments, these should be distributed after examination, but recently it appears that usage in various sectors has increased, so from this Ox year forward, not only daily payments but also fixed distribution usage should be specially reduced through coordination in all sectors.
　These matters should be handled appropriately.

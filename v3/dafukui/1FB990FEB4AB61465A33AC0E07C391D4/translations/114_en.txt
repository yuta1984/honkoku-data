○The town and rural assistance loan (o-tanomi-ko) was ordered in Kansei 11, year of the Sheep (1799). Regarding repayment, there have been successive postponements and deferrals. From Bunka 5, year of the Dragon (1808) to the recent year of the Horse, over three years, one-third of the silver disbursement was paid each time. From this year, the full amount should be paid as originally planned, but it has been ordered to continue as before. Also, regarding rice contributions and river maintenance procurement annual installments, the same has applied since the year of the Dragon, but this too shall continue to be paid as before. Communicate this appropriately to each party.

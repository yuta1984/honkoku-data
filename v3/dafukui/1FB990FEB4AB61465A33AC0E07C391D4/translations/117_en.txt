　　　12th month
　　　Announced at this place on the 8th day of the 1st month

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Town Magistrate
○Regarding Enkoji Temple, a temple serving as an administrative office for Nishi Honganji: when previously assigned duties by Honganji, they went directly to Edo without consulting our office, which is improper conduct violating domain law. Therefore, they have been confined to the detention house. This matter should be communicated to Enkoji upon their arrival. Furthermore, this should be handled in consultation with the inspectors.

○Regarding the current summons from Edo for Nishi Honganji sect temples, as domain territory headmen have also received respective summons, large gatherings in the castle town or elsewhere that violate domain law would be unacceptable. The village headmen should take care to ensure there are no misunderstandings and should communicate instructions accordingly.

○Regarding your own matter: you have been assigned official duties for the return journey to Edo, so you should depart as soon as preparations are complete.
　　　　　However, on the 29th day of the 2nd month, return with your group members
　1st month, 13th day

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Administrative Head
○Regarding the petition concerning the summons to Edo of Nishi Honganji sect clergy and followers: since these are subjects of our domain, it is naturally proper that full compassion be extended to all.
Summons from the shogunate are serious matters, and should there be any delays, it would trouble the shogunate and become a grave matter that would make it difficult to rely on compassion alone, so the petition is difficult to accept.
However, since inspectors have been dispatched this time, they have been ordered to proceed with full understanding of all matters. Furthermore, until departure for Edo, every possible consideration will be given, so from now on, each person should avoid misunderstandings, and all summoned persons should depart immediately regardless of location.
1. The inspector plans to depart on the coming 23rd day, so all summoned persons should be ordered to depart without exception before then. Moreover, upon arrival at that place, lodging will be provided within the Reiganjima official quarters, so this should also be communicated for their knowledge.

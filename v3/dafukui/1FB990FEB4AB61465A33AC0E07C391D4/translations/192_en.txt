Oral Statement
　1. Regarding the foreign ship surveillance matter ordered by the authorities, we acknowledge it as previously communicated. Furthermore, our understanding and preparedness is as follows:
　1. All people of the coastal villages, regardless of age or gender, should immediately notify officials if they spot suspicious ships at sea
　1. As for fishermen, who go out to sea two or three ri daily, if they sight foreign ships, they should hurry back to shore and report to village officials
　　However, they should follow the instructions of village officials
　1. Village officials should immediately report such matters to the government office. Since defense would be difficult if foreigners land after such reports are made, to prevent landing, flags should be erected on elevated spots along the shore, villagers should gather in large numbers and raise war cries, using conch shells, gongs, drums and other noisemakers to create an intimidating defensive formation, making it appear dangerous for foreigners to land or even approach
　If flags are not available, anything white and conspicuous such as cloth should be used to create flag-like displays. While drums should be available in most villages, conch shells and gongs may not be, so several bamboo flutes blown together would suffice. These matters should be discussed and prepared in each village

　　While maintaining such intimidation, messenger runners will reach the castle town, and the prepared defense officials will quickly rush to the scene
　1. Since unexpected nighttime landings cannot be predicted, and there would be no time for consultation or instructions in such cases, one must act with quick judgment according to circumstances
　　Regarding the above surveillance measures, if permanent assignments were made to villages for these procedures, it would burden villages with expenses, and of course there would be no compensation for such duties. Therefore, this matter should be communicated without fail from village leaders down to all residents, and since gongs, drums, and noisemakers are involved, temple officials should also be notified, and vigilance must be maintained day and night without relaxation

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Town Magistrate
　○Umbrella shop owner Sōzaemon from North Yokomachi, Matsumoto, petitions as follows: In previous years, he applied to establish a system in the Matsumoto area to collect garbage and refuse from various places, burn it into ash at fields outside Shinmachi, and use it as fertilizer. However, this system was not sustained in various locations and was discontinued. Now, as the Products Office is establishing various policies for domestic production, he wishes to undertake the garbage burning project again. Therefore, he requests permission to collect garbage and refuse throughout the castle town and burn it into ash, and asks that the senior councillors approve this petition as requested

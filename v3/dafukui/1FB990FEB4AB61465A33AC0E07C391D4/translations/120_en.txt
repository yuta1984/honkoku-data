Regarding the successive inheritance claims that were made, those who misinterpreted the religious doctrine and insisted on their own views were subjected to official punishment, while for the remaining temple followers who had misunderstandings, the magistrate's office communicated that the head abbot would provide gradual instruction. This led to procedures whereby emissary monks from various provinces would travel to provide religious guidance. However, in the villages of Echizen Province, there were difficulties in comprehending the main temple's teachings, and they even rejected these emissary monks. The main temple, concerned that even the slightest misunderstanding of the founder's spiritual peace could result in no evidence of proper devotion, summoned some of the branch temples, but they failed to appear. Consequently, it became unavoidable to report to the magistrate's office that religious instruction could not be properly implemented - an regrettable situation. While it may seem as though the current head abbot's initial correspondence regarding the dispute differs from the religious doctrine and spiritual peace that the head abbot should now communicate, since the head abbot states there should be no dual-path instruction, this is deeply suspicious. The current summons from the magistrate's office is fortunate, so if you promptly appear and clearly explain not only the spiritual peace you maintain, but also thoroughly present those doubtful points you cannot comprehend, right and wrong will quickly be distinguished, the righteousness you have long devoted yourselves to will swiftly be established, and your sincere wishes will be fulfilled. However, requesting postponement of the summons date represents the ultimate misunderstanding. Originally, apart from prohibited sects, the government does not forcibly direct matters of religious doctrine and spiritual understanding. However, since there were those who poorly interpreted religious doctrine and spiritual peace, creating a dual path that made people difficult to govern, and since the head abbot's direct efforts were insufficient, it became unavoidable to request government investigation. The fact that temple follower instruction matters were brought before the government is something the head abbot deeply regrets. While your intention should be to promptly depart for the capital and thoroughly study religious doctrine together, the fact that large numbers have gathered to earnestly request postponement of the summons is, first and foremost,

tantamount to grave lawlessness toward the government and represents no light misunderstanding. Therefore, those summoned must depart for the capital immediately. Even for those who remain, if there are further petitions, they should present details through two or three representatives and promptly submit them to the magistrate's office - this should be explained as a matter of consequences.

　As just announced, this recent matter involved great trouble and consideration in Edo, with special assistance from your end as well, so it can be surmised that there is nothing further to communicate to the government. In that case, everyone should understand this as an unavoidable matter. From now on, if clergy and lay followers petition the Kyoto main temple for withdrawal of the request, and the main temple grants this and communicates such to the government magistrate's office, that would be appropriate. If there are such intentions among you, this is a fortunate time. Although the government's consequences also mention that there may be suspicion about whether the head abbot's initial correspondence regarding the dispute differs from the religious doctrine and spiritual peace the head abbot should now communicate, since the head abbot states there should be no dual-path instruction, it is clear that there is no difference in spiritual peace. To clear these doubts and thoroughly understand these matters, even when engaging with this petition for withdrawal, the harmonious intentions of the four-article supplementary paper circulation that Shotokuji previously maintained should be set aside. Following the magistrate's office consequences and our domain lord's compassion, as this is an extremely weighty matter, we should gratefully submit in reverence. Even if there have been mishandled arrangements from the main temple until now, setting those matters aside, the matter of deeply contemplating domain law and compassion should accord with everyone's long-held intentions.

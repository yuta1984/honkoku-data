As ordered above, the matter has been communicated to each party, as reported by the goyōnin (administrative official).

To the Magistrate
○Regarding the mountain estate granted to Kanaya Yasuke: Although permission was granted last winter in the same manner as for retainers' walking grounds, due to his poor financial circumstances, he has requested to hire one or two mountain guards and stonecutters to quarry and sell stones as a commercial enterprise. However, given existing regulations, approval is difficult. Nevertheless, out of special compassion, permission is granted for ten years from this Year of the Boar to the coming Year of the Monkey, as requested. This decision shall be communicated accordingly.
However, this is limited to mountain guards and stonecutters only. Moreover, the names of both stonecutter representatives must be reported to the construction office. For all other matters, following regulations, all affairs must be consulted with the construction department and handled according to their instructions, ensuring no improper conduct occurs.

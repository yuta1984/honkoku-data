○Regarding domain finances, which have long been in difficulty, repeated fires have inevitably caused financial strain with no prospects for construction funds. Out of necessity, this spring we petitioned Kanda-bashi Dainagon-sama for financial assistance. Through his unchanged benevolence, he also appealed to the shogunate, and it was announced on the 13th at Hitotsubashi Palace that 15,000 ryō of gold would be lent with interest, to be repaid over ten years. This represents extraordinary kindness. You are instructed to inform others of this matter for their understanding.

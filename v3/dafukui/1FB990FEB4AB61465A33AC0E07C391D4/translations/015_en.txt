○Recently we have been ordered to undertake the dredging and construction work of the waterways in front of the ship warehouses on Ōkawa-dōri and the rivers in the Honjo area. Given our already difficult financial situation, I am deeply troubled about how to procure such excessive funds. As everyone knows, such duties have not been ordered for a long time, and we cannot allow any hindrance to this matter. Therefore, we have no choice but to request funds from the retainers as well as townspeople and rural areas. We are primarily requesting financial arrangements from other provinces, but given the large amount, the procurement method is uncertain. Regarding the retainers, we have already imposed borrowed rice payments, and in recent years have imposed long-term half-reduced borrowed rice, causing extreme hardship. Even for townspeople and rural areas, various procurement measures have been imposed, and I lament that the entire domain will fall into even greater poverty. However, these are unavoidable times, and I think that from the highest to lowest retainers, everyone should somehow manage and continue their duties. The senior counselors will communicate this further.　1st month

○As proclaimed in the personal handwriting, this time after a long interval, official duties have been ordered, and it is absolutely essential that these duties be carried out without any hindrance, which causes great concern. Therefore, financial arrangements are being primarily requested from Edo, Osaka, and various other provinces. Although various deliberations have been held, there are no alternatives. Therefore, from this year of the dog until the coming year of the rat, for three years, half-reduced borrowed rice has been ordered. This comes on top of the long-term half-reduced borrowed rice in recent years, followed by continued eight-bu borrowed rice that has been imposed

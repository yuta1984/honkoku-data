Bunsei 4th year (1821)

　　　　　Memorandum of instructions from the District Magistrate　　　　To the Head Village Officials
1. In recent years, many people from rural areas have been requesting to go serve in other domains, which may be why there is a shortage of servants for the lord's retainers. This spring in particular, the shortage is extreme and causing serious difficulties. Therefore, you should investigate and give the following instructions to the villages under your jurisdiction.
1. As a general rule, each village should first provide one person each
　However, those who have many brothers and whose absence would not interfere with farming should be selected after investigation. Since there will certainly be villages where farming is at full capacity and it is difficult to send people into service, villages with available manpower should send two or three people
1. For villages with stipend allocations, you should visit each stipend recipient's residence to ask about their needs, and promptly report to the office which residences will hire people and which residences have no need
1. Villages that receive stipends through domain warehouse distribution should also visit each residence to ask about their needs, with the same reporting method as the previous article
1. Villages that are too busy with mulberry cultivation to absolutely spare anyone should conduct thorough investigations and submit written reports to that effect. If there are people from that village who have gone to serve in other domains, they should be called back. However, if there are compelling reasons why those who have left cannot be called back due to their circumstances, that should be reported

1. For villages without stipend allocations and that are not domain warehouse stipend areas, after investigation, those who will enter service this time should report to either Notoya Naouemon or Yanagiya Jibei in Hamamachi within this month
1. Regarding those from villages who are currently serving lord's retainers, you should report which residences they are serving
1. Service in other domains is currently suspended, so this should be announced. However, there may be unavoidable circumstances, and if there are cases where people have traditionally gone to serve in other domains and contributed to tax collection, such cases should be reported
　However, you must strictly investigate whether there are any who have gone to other domains or territories secretly without even notifying village officials, and if there are such people, they should be reported as unregistered persons. While there should be no such people, this is announced for your understanding, so village officials should have head village officials report that the population registers are accurate
　Announce the above to all villages, and furthermore, send young and honest people, strictly instructing that there should be no haggling over their wages, and they should be sent within this month. If servants become even more scarce in the future and it becomes necessary to use corvée labor, difficulties may arise, so keep this in mind and handle matters appropriately

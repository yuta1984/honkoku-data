●999■ each one cries. How many voices is this? 999 crows times 999 voices equals ●998,000●●1 voice.

To divide this by 999 as described above. In square root extraction ●998,000●●1 voice is placed. Looking at the positions, there is no thousands place. Seeing it as nine hundred 《9 divided by 9》 subtract 810,000 voices. Place 900 crows above. Previously, on the left, double the 900 crows and place on the left, making 1,800 crows. Using this as a reference, divide the remaining voices by one digit. After 900 comes 90 《8 divided by 9》 subtract 72,000 voices. Small angle 《9 divided by 9》 subtract 8,100 voices. Again, double the current 90 and add to the left, making 198. With this, divide the remaining voices by one digit. After 990 comes 9 《9 divided by 9》 subtract 8,100 voices 《8 divided by 9》 subtract 720 voices. Small angle 《9 divided by 9》 subtract 81 voices and clear ●thus knowing it is 999 crows.

One: Also, in 999 bays with 999 crows each, if each crow cries 999 times, what is the number of voices? 999 bays times 999 crows, then times 999 voices equals

●9,970,000,000●●2,999 voices.

To divide this by 999 bays as described above. This is cube root extraction.

First, place 9,970,000,000●●2,999 voices. This also has no thousands place. Seeing it as the hundreds place, call it 99 《9 divided by 9》 subtract 7,290,000,000. Place 900 bays above.

Remaining voices: 2,680,000,000●●2,999 voices. Previously multiply the master's 900 bays, now multiply this by 30,000 to get 243. With this, divide the remaining voices by one digit. After 900 comes 90. The left reference is broken calculation. Again, previously multiply the current 90 and place on the left. Previously multiply the head 900 by triangle and add the current 90 to get 279. Multiply this by the left 81 to get 225,990,000 voices. Subtract this from the right remaining voices. Remaining: 26,703,999 voices. The left reference is broken calculation. Again, previously place the master's 99 on both sides and multiply to get 98●1. Multiply this by 30,000 to get 294●3. Using this as reference, divide the remaining voices by one digit. After 990 comes 9. Remaining

Remaining voices: 241,299 voices. The left reference is calculation. Again multiply the current 9 and place on the left. Previously multiply the master's 99 by triangle, add the current 9 to get 2,979. Multiply this by the left 81 to get 241,299 voices. Subtract this from the remaining voices and clear, thus knowing it is 999 bays.

As the rain continued to fall, we were sitting inside during the evening, telling various stories about this floating world, when someone told this tale: In Nagasaki, there was a wealthy merchant named Tarojinamed who dealt in Chinese goods. One time, he loaded his trading goods onto a large ship bound for Osaka, but due to some natural disaster, the wind suddenly changed direction, the ship could no longer proceed, and his cargo disappeared like foam on the waves. From that point on, Taroji's household gradually fell into ruin, and he came to live in such poverty that even his morning meals and evening lamp oil were uncertain, passing his days in this manner.

Now, one day, his old friends had gathered at the back room of the neighboring Tsuboya shop to enjoy linked verse and haikai poetry, but when that entertainment ended, they made a great commotion with shamisen, koto, and dancing, creating nothing but merriment.

When Taroji heard these sounds, he was moved to nostalgia for the old days and sat there with nothing but tears. "No, wait," he said to his heart, "they say that sake can dispel cold and wind within three inches, and there are also folk sayings that it can chase away sorrows." So he prepared what little drinking vessel he had and, talking to himself, poured large cups - serving himself and drinking by himself. As he drank, savoring the floral fragrance like plum blossoms, the sake was quickly exhausted, leaving him feeling even more melancholy. "Perhaps I should abandon this world and become a monk," he muttered to himself. Hearing this, his wife rushed to stop him in alarm. Soon the guests from the Tsuboya shop also came out, and seeing this scene, they cried "This is Taroji!" in shock. After hearing the whole story, they reflected that the world is built upon impermanence, and such circumstances are truly pitiful. Tomorrow, like the waves, we cannot know today.

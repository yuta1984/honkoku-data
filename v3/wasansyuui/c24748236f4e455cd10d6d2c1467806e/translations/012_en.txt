To help the abandoned ship, everyone took hold of ropes and started a ten-thousand ryō mutual financing association (mujin). They decided to let Taroji take the first turn, and just then a ship arrived at the port, so he was able to buy trading goods and make profits from buying and selling again. Year after year, he lent money at 16% annual interest, and just as they were saying how fortunate this was, the dream was shattered and only the mujin remained.

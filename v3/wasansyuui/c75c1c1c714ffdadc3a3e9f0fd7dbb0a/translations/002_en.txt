Preface to Hōen Hiken-shū, Volume 1

Mathematics has been practiced since ancient times, with knowledgeable calculators establishing various ingenious methods. However, when we examine the books that have gained attention in recent times, we find works such as "Jinkōki," "Shikaku Mondō," "Enpō Yonkan," and "Ketsugi-shū." These books appear to be used for human practice and study. Nevertheless, these four collections are by no means trivial and are beyond the reach of the ignorant. Although there are various methods available, the four collections differ only slightly from one another, and if one considers their methods and applies oneself diligently to practice, one can make them part of one's own knowledge.

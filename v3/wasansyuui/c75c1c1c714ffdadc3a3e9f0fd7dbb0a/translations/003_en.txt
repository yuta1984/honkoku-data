Nevertheless, among these four collections, there are many mathematical problems for which no solutions are provided. With my foolish mind, I have named this work "Hōen Hiken-shū" (Secret Views on Squares and Circles) and written down matters similar to existing methods. While it may be embarrassing to show this to others, and the author's techniques may be shallow and inadequate, I have compiled these writings thinking that perhaps someone even more foolish than myself might find them helpful for practice.

Now again establish another 5 ken in the quotient. Compare this 5 ken with the corner using the multiplication table to add 5 from 1×5 to the auxiliary divisor (廉), making it 35. Again compare this auxiliary divisor with the quotient using the multiplication table to add 15 from 3×5 and 25 from 5×5 to the divisor, making it 475. Again compare this divisor with the quotient using the multiplication table to subtract from the dividend: subtract 2,000 tsubo from 4×5, subtract 350 tsubo from 5×7, subtract 25 tsubo from 5×5. When all are subtracted from the dividend and balanced, we know the quotient is 15 ken on four sides and six faces. The subsequent divisor, auxiliary divisor, and corner are not needed.

Establish the unknown quantity (天元) as 1 for the cubic face, square it again to make it the cubic volume. It cancels with the stated volume. Opening this by cube root extraction yields a quotient of 15 ken. This matches the problem.

《Title: Eighth Section - Strip Vertical Cube Root Extraction Method (taijū kairitsu-hō)》
▲There is a cubic volume of 2,304 tsubo. The height is 4 ken longer than the square face. What are this height and square face?
　Answer: 《Square face: 22 ken, Height: 16 ken》

〽Place the volume of 2,304 tsubo in the dividend. Also place the length of 4 ken in the auxiliary divisor. Place 1 in the corner. When examining the place values, it is the tens place. Raise both the auxiliary divisor and corner by one place and establish 10 ken in the quotient.
　　　　　　This is shown in the next diagram.

〽Now compare the quotient with the corner using the multiplication table to add 1 from 1×1 to the auxiliary divisor, making it 14. Again compare this auxiliary divisor with the quotient using the multiplication table to add 1 from 1×1 and 4 from 1×4 to the divisor, making it 14. Again compare this divisor with the quotient using the multiplication table to subtract from the dividend: subtract 1,000 tsubo from 1×1, and subtract 400 tsubo from 1×4 from the dividend. This is also shown in the next diagram.

〽Now again compare the quotient with the corner using the multiplication table of 1×1 to add to the auxiliary divisor, making it 24. Again compare this auxiliary divisor with the quotient using the multiplication table to add 2 from 1×2 and 4 from 1×4 to the divisor, making it 38. Now again compare the quotient with the corner using the multiplication table to add 1 from 1×1 to the auxiliary divisor, making it 34. The divisor and auxiliary divisor □ descend by one place.

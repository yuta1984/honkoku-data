Preface
At some point in time, the business called "Nagasaki Mujin" began in the world, serving as assistance for people to make their way through life. However, without properly understanding the distinction between profit and loss, people naturally became absorbed in acquiring gold and silver. Consequently, in calculations with an interest rate of 16%, when we examine what the profits are, there are only differences of opinion in the world from beginning to end. Perhaps the abacus calculations in this remote region are mistaken? Generally speaking, arithmetic measures the mysteries of heaven and earth. Now here, I humbly explain as one who understands the calculation methods of mujin.

Someone asked me about Nagasaki Mujin:
1. Assuming one bu of gold, eleven participants in the mujin, calculated at 16% interest rate, those who receive pay out 40 me of eirakusen annually, completing payment in ten years
1. The first position receives 250 me, the eleventh position receives 400 me. From the second position onward, each receives progressively more
   [Illegible text] The gold gradually decreases. Payments are made through the eighth position, from the ninth position onward, no payments are made
1. Working with interest-free money, each person's payments from start to finish. Similarly, the profit and loss of money received. Asking about gradual interest
1. Working with money at 20% interest, asking about money received. Similarly, profit and loss
1. [Illegible text] At the end, asking about gradual interest. Profit and loss from start to finish. Additionally, asking about compound interest
1. Square root method, cube root method, immediate oral instruction

I answer and say:　　　　　　　●Ei refers to 100 me per ryō of gold
　　　○Receiving increases
First position receives: 250 me of eirakusen　　Second position: 257 momme 5 bu of eirakusen
Third position: 265 momme　　　Fourth position: 272 momme 5 bu

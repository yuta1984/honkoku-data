1. The monthly courtesy ceremony was conducted for all retainers as usual. ○ Before the ceremony at the Oshoin (Small Study), Hanosuke-kata and Mitsue-kata were appointed as Senior Retainer-level Political Affairs Trainees, and it was announced that they would handle all matters in the same way as those who had previously served as trainees. This matter was communicated through an official written notice. The chamberlains and chief inspectors attended in the second room of the Oshoin, and the financial officials who served today, following precedent, all wore formal hemp kamishimo.

1. Regarding the aforementioned appointments, while it is customary to communicate such matters to all domain retainers through circular letters from the inspectors, since fortunately everyone was in attendance today, it was deemed that circular letters were unnecessary and oral communication would suffice. This was conveyed to the monthly duty inspector Nakanishi Raizo, and instructions were given to notify villages, town magistrates, local officials, and temple and shrine officials throughout the domain according to established precedent. ○ As congratulations today, ten sea bream from Hama[□] and one barrel of fine sake (containing two sho) were presented to the two parties.

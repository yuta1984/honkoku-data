When planting, do not scatter the seeds. After germination, keep two or three seedlings in one spot and pull out the rest. After germination, pile soil outside the plot to make ridges. Dig beside each plot and put in plenty of manure, which is good. Also place composted soil around the melon roots. When the vines grow to a good length, distribute and spread the vines, placing a little soil at each joint. If you do this, roots will grow from the joints as well, causing vigorous growth and many fruits. When the vine reaches one foot in length, quickly pinch off the tips. If you don't pinch the tips, there will be few fruits. Remove melon worms daily. Lift vines that crawl onto walkways back onto the ridges. Avoid continuous cropping on the same land - change the soil for planting. However, if you create new plots with fresh soil, you can plant in the same location every year. If you water with clear water, the roots will harden and the soil will become poor, not thriving for long. Add three buckets of water to one bucket of manure, put it in a large jar for three or four days, then pour this mixture. Generally, fine melons can be found at Toji in Kyoto, Makuwa village in Mino, Senshu border, and Edo. In ancient times, Koma melons from Yamashiro were even mentioned in old poems, but that name no longer exists.

Pumpkin (Bōbura): Shizhen says to plant seeds in the third month. Sandy, fertile soil is good. ○ In the second month, expose to sun and plant in good, soft, fertile soil. Make the ground slightly concave, plant the seeds, and cover with ash. Use manure as they grow. If planted in shaded areas, they will not bear fruit.

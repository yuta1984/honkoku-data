Water Pepper (Tade) - Suitable for waterside or wetlands. Produces spikes in autumn. There is a small water pepper that produces spikes early in spring and summer. There is also a large water pepper with very large spikes. It grows abundantly on Mount Hiko in Buzen province, called "hikotate," and should be used as a condiment. Separately, there is another large water pepper, and also Chinese water pepper, which has leaves larger than ordinary water pepper with purple color. It has a milder taste than small water pepper, which is good. Generally, water pepper eliminates fish toxins and dispels liver qi. This is also an indispensable item among vegetables. However, eating too much reduces blood and dries bodily fluids. Its nature is not good. The taste of the boiled broth is sweet.

Coriander (Koenisui) - Harvest seeds in summer months and sow in the 8th month. Should be planted sparsely. Grows in winter and spring. In the language of Nanban (foreigners), it is called "koentoro." Both its fruits and leaves when raw have a very bad smell. However, it effectively removes bad odors. When eating something with a bad smell that makes one's breath foul, chewing a little coriander seed will make it disappear immediately. When sprinkled lightly on raw fish and meat with fishy odors, pork, chicken, or other foul-smelling things, the fishy smell and bad odor disappear instantly. When suffering from smallpox and the complexion becomes poor due to contact with foul-smelling things or impurities, coriander seeds should be decocted and poured over rice porridge, which will cure it immediately. Grind the seeds to powder, keep in a small container, and occasionally sprinkle on fishy things like fish and meat before eating.

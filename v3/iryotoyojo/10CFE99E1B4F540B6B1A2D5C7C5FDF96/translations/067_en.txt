Grains

Cowpea (Sasage) - Writing sasage as "kakumame" (角豆) is incorrect. According to the Agricultural Administration Complete Book, seeds should be sown around the time of Grain Rain (mid-third month). According to Kōgi, cover jars with ash.

Cowpea refers to sasage whose vines grow long and climb on hedges. There are white ones, colored ones, and red ones, all with the same taste and good properties. The long pods reach one shaku four to five sun, up to two shaku in length. There are also short ones that bear many pods in one cluster. All can be boiled and eaten together with their pods. They have good properties and are among the finest summer vegetables. Their utility to common people rivals that of eggplant. From before the third month until mid-sixth month, they should be planted successively at intervals of about ten to fifteen days. If planted too early, they will be damaged by cold and wither quickly. By planting successively later, fruits will bear until the seventh, eighth, and ninth months. Those planted late in the sixth month will bear fruit in the eighth and ninth months.

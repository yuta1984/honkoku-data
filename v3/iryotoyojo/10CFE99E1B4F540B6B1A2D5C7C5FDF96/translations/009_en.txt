Proceed in this manner to plant seeds. For ridge planting, make the planting area slightly lower than ground level, spread fertilizer in the furrows, dry it, then plant. For both broadcast and furrow planting, mix fertilizer soil with the seeds before planting. Since liquid fertilizer will be applied later, broadcast planting is not good. Use ridge planting instead. If the land area is limited, to conserve space, make the ridges narrow and plant densely, then later thin out the middle rows after the vegetables have grown a little.

Daikon radish, napa cabbage, carrot, spinach, mustard, lettuce, mustard greens, spatterdock, and chives - all of these are best planted in rows. This method is suitable for applying liquid fertilizer. For areas where fertilizer has been spread abundantly beforehand, broadcast sowing is also acceptable. For large seeds, cover them lightly with soil. Small seeds should not be covered with soil. Seeds like mustard should simply be scattered by sweeping with a broom. For seeds that scatter in the wind, cover them with straw or similar material. Follow according to what suits each plant's nature. Also, if sandy soil is plowed many times, the soil's vital energy escapes and the soil fertility weakens. This depends on the type of soil.

If you frequently plow in summer and plant seeds in soft soil, there will be many soil insects. If you suddenly plow hard soil to soften it and then sow seeds, there will be fewer insects. After wheat harvest, there are fewer cutworms. For wetlands and muddy soil, turn the field over and dry it well in the sun before planting.

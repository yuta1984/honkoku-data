...should not be done, say some people. Looking at Li Shizhen's "Food Materia Medica," there is no doubt it is butterbur (gidong). When butterbur first emerges with small leaves, it is called "coin butterbur" (zeni-fuki) and eaten together with the leaves. The stems are eaten from February to April. ○ There is a type of grass called tsuba (Japanese silver leaf). Its leaves and stems resemble butterbur and have a glossy appearance. It produces yellow flowers in autumn. It does not appear in the Materia Medica. Like butterbur, remove the skin, boil well, and soak in water for a long time before eating. Its taste is like butterbur. Its nature is cold. It eliminates various poisons. It especially kills fish poison. When poisoned by pufferfish (fugu), grind this and extract the juice to be taken. It is extremely effective. When ground and applied to red swellings, it shows signs of reducing them. Steaming and making dried goods is also good. This grass also appears in ancient texts.

Amaranth (Hiyu) - The "Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration" states: "Sow seeds in February, transplant beside eggplant ridges in late March. Water similarly and they will flourish." Shizhen says: "Scatter seeds in March. After June they are not suitable for eating." ○ There are many types of amaranth: white amaranth, red amaranth, purple amaranth, and also variegated ones. White amaranth is the best. What is called "Chinese amaranth" - perhaps it was so named because it came from China in recent times? Seeds should be sown freely throughout the garden. They self-seed and flourish abundantly. This too is an excellent summer vegetable. Especially good in drought years. ○ When amaranth stems grow long, pick and break them off early. Later, harvest the young leaves that grow thickly again. Should be picked repeatedly.

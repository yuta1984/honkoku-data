Generally, when sowing seeds, first soak them in water for two to three days, then mix with fertilizer and sand before sowing. If sown too densely, the seedlings will have difficulty growing. They should be sown sparsely. After germination, occasionally pour fish juice or white honey over them. When transplanting, leave two shaku and five sun between rows, enough space for a person to pass through. The distance between individual plants should be about one shaku and five sun. If planted too densely, they will not flourish and will produce few fruits. Wide spacing is better. The places where seedlings are planted should be lower and deeper than the ground surface. It is good to pour water, stir the soil, and place fertilizer. If too high, they will be damaged by the sun. If the ground is high, even when liquid fertilizer is poured, it will flow to the sides and not remain. Prepare by digging the ground to create sections, and add soil when planting.

Another method for planting eggplants: from the frost month (November), make ridges one shaku apart, dig holes one shaku square and about one shaku deep, with distances of over one shaku between each hole. In winter, put rotted straw, horse manure, and anything else that can serve as fertilizer into the holes, and also place December snow inside. When summer comes, plant two eggplant seedlings in each hole. Remove any that wither. Doing this will make them grow large with abundant fruit. After the eggplant seedlings have grown, caterpillars appear on the undersides of leaves and eat them, preventing proper growth, so these should be removed daily. As they dislike drought, muddy water should be poured every evening. Generally, when planting eggplants...

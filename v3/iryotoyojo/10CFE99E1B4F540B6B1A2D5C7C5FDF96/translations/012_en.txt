not yet gone, so it is difficult for seeds to germinate. If planted late in autumn, the cold air has already settled in the ground and seeds are difficult to germinate. Even if they germinate, they are difficult to grow.

Also it is said that "the first duty in planting seeds is to gather manure." The methods of gathering manure are not limited to one way. Human excrement and urine, water used for human bathing, livestock manure, muddy water from sewers, ash from stoves, burnt soil from stoves, mud from ditches, river mud, water used to wash fish and birds, fish and bird entrails, also rotted straw and thatch, as well as leaves of plants and trees - all of these become fertilizer. Also, the rice washing water from washing rice morning and evening should be put in a designated container and left to rot for a long time, then poured on vegetable roots, especially butterbur roots. It is good to add half urine. If only rice washing water is poured, the ground will harden afterwards.

When watering plants and trees during hot weather, morning and evening are good. Avoid midday. In the evening when the ground heat has not yet cooled, water should not be poured. Early morning watering is considered best. In the evening too, water should be poured late after the ground heat has cooled.

For poppy seeds, carrots, lettuce and such, after sowing the seeds, if they are exposed to sun and become dry without moisture, they are difficult to germinate. Above what has been sown, construct a bamboo frame and spread reed mats or straw mats

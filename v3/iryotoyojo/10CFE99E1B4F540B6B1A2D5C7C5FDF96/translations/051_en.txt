They should be planted early so they grow vigorously during the rainy season. If the seedlings encounter heat early after the rainy season ends when they are still young, they will have difficulty growing. Fertilizer should be applied twice before the rainy season. If transplanted to wheat field bottoms or hard ground, there will be no boring insects (kirimushi). However, if the hard ground is not plowed first and the soil becomes soft, boring insects will appear. First plant them, and when the seedlings have grown large and are free from insect damage, then transplant them. However, while this method eliminates insect problems, growth is slow. If the base of the seedlings is wrapped with bamboo bark cut into pieces of two to three sun, there will be no insect problems. Shiran leaves or omoto leaves are also good. Those remaining in the seedbed should be allowed to take root before transplanting the seedlings, then they will grow quickly and bear fruit. Moreover, because the soil is hard, cutworms will not eat them. After planting, if they are thriving, urine should occasionally be poured on them. Those in the seedbed are not damaged even by drought and grow vigorously easily.

Generally, eggplants should not be planted in shaded places. If planted in the shade of cowpeas or trees, they will not grow or bear fruit. The Honzo (materia medica) states that the nature of eggplant is extremely bad. Raw eggplant has the worst nature, but the skin should be removed, cut, and soaked in water for a long time to extract the yellow juice. For morning meals, soak from the previous evening; for evening meals, soak from morning. When well-cooked and soft, the taste changes and there is no toxicity. There is no harm even from long-term consumption. However, it should be avoided by those with malaria, dysentery, typhoid fever, and postpartum women.

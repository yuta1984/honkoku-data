seed production becomes delayed. Also, choose the day to plant, and when they sprout, pull out and eat the small ones. The spacing between each plant should be about one shaku (approximately 30 cm). If transplanting, when they reach five to six sun (15-18 cm) in length, select the larger ones to transplant. It also says: The planting method is to first remove weeds, and after rain passes, cultivate the ground. If it doesn't rain, water the ground from one day before to moisten it, and the next day plow well and make ridges. Either cut ridges or sow broadly. Cover with soil to a thickness of about one finger's width.

If there is rain within five to six days, water is not needed; if there is no rain, add a little water. Too much will harden the ground. When seedlings grow to more than one sun (about 3 cm), pour liquid manure on them. It also says: Plant in sandy soil. In places without sandy soil, use plenty of grass ash to soften the ground. If the soil is hard, the roots will not grow large.

It also says: Turnips ripen slowly. If they encounter the rainy season, many will not ripen well and there will be many empty seeds. When planting, select seeds and remove the empty ones. Or shake them, which is good. Use seeds that are large and round. If you plant empty seeds, the roots will not grow large and insects will eat the leaves. If you sow seeds in August, the leaves will be good but the roots small. Only if you plant in early July will both roots and leaves be good. ○ "Kyoka Hitsuyō" says: Take fertile land and make it six

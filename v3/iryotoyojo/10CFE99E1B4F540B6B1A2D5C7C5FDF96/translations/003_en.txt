I have been not only without virtue since my youth, but also lack the talent to establish merit or wise words. Moreover, if I were to live in this world without farming yet being satisfied with food, without weaving yet wearing warm clothing, squandering the world's wealth, and becoming nothing but a pest between heaven and earth, I would die like birds and beasts and decay like plants and trees - this would be most regrettable. Therefore, though it is not my true intention to do something akin to discarding precious gems to pick up dirt and stones, I wish at least to create these humble and trifling writings within my limited capabilities, to assist the teachings of experienced gardeners and serve as a tiny supplement - perhaps one ten-thousandth - to the livelihood of the people. In this regard, I am not ashamed of criticism from the gentlemen scholars of our time who study moral philosophy.

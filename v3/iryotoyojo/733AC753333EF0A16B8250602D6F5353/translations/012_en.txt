The boss of the "yani-sagari" group, from Kokubu to Shinichi,
there is no such thing as "yani-sagari."
Though a connoisseur, he is very wealthy
and is a regular customer of a courtesan named Sarasa.
He put money in a measuring box and
scattered it like bean-throwing
to please her. Nowadays, those who
spend a lot of money are said
to spend "happa."
Since Kokubu tobacco
is easy to use,
"happa"
refers to tobacco.
Thus the expression "happa to"
comes from this.
Generally, in pleasure quarters,
one bu is called one bu.
Until now, one ryo has
never been called
four bu either,
starting from Kokubu

One ryo is called one bu,
five ryo called five monme,
ten ryo called
ten monme.
Because of tobacco,
wordplay began.
Indeed,
what we call
a great connoisseur
says good
things.
Wealthy people
rejoice in the recession of big money,
and Wankyu thinks
he himself is
a Fujiya

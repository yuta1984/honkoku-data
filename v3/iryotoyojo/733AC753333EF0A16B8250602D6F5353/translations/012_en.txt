The boss of the slouchers, first of all from here,
there is no such thing as "yani-sagari" (slouching).
Despite being a connoisseur, he is very wealthy,
and is a regular customer of a courtesan named Sarasa.
He put money in measuring boxes and
scattered it around like bean-throwing
to please her. Now, those who
spend a lot of money are said to
"spend happa" - there is such
an expression. Since he uses
Kokubu tobacco,
"happa"
refers to tobacco.
Thus the origin of saying "happa"
comes from this matter.
Generally speaking, in pleasure quarters,
one bu is called one bu.
Until now, one ryo has never
been called
four bu either,
but from Kokubu...

Because of tobacco,
this stylish talk began.
Indeed,
what we call
a great connoisseur
says good
things.
Rich people
handle large sums
with joy, and in their pleasure-seeking
they think of themselves
as lattice house

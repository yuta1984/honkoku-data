Even boorish people,
if they have money,
are popular, but
when a connoisseur has money,
it's like giving
a club to an ogre—
nothing can match it.
Even I myself, if I don't smoke tobacco
when going out to play, this is what happens.
Now in Yoshiwara establishments,
there isn't a single courtesan
who doesn't have a tobacco tray ready.
At Koji-saki,
the addictive tobacco—
there's no one who leaves
without smoking tobacco
in an uncouth manner.
I've never heard of or seen
such a person.
〽One puff
of tobacco
is worth a thousand ryo
in business,
but that's fine

Going together with
Tateshinten,
resting at
a tea house
by the horse stable.
To show the
neighboring father,
Kokubu rests.
Being there, only that way,
taking Kokubu's matter as a guess,
about the master who speaks to Shinten—
it doesn't matter if you call him boorish.
There are no bold fellows among boorish people.
As for the so-called "street-wise" people, about half
are stylish but have boorish hearts,
it's said there are many such fellows.
Though speaking ill of Kokubu,
he pays no heed.
I think he's someone who watched
with a carefree spirit.

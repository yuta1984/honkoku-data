In the Tensho era,
famous horses
from various provinces,
not wanting to be outdone,
numbered up to a thousand.
Regardless of high or low quality,
they all fought from daytime, so among the group
in a building they named it "tateto" (establishing reputation),
all having fierce temperaments, yet also having gentle
qualities, so many lives were not visible.

With skillful nature,
sword fighting
was expertly done,
so even in theater
performances,
performing "tate" (stage combat)
refers to this

The enemy side had Ryuo as general, and from the plucking onward,
only those of extremely soft disposition, fighting at the aged Kawakami of the previous generation,
but since no battle was decided either way, Oyamada
brought peace negotiations to both sides, and though each side
expressed their schemes, it was ultimately
internal strife.
Whether preferring soft or hard, nothing would work, so
going round and round the peace conference venue,
from this point on, for any tobacco,
they established
a firm
promise
to have
Oyamada
handle
the
blending.

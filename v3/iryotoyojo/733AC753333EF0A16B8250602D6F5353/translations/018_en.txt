When one dreams about
what one thinks about,
Tōbei,
who in his daily life
devotes his heart
to business,
therefore
while dozing
had a dream and awoke.
Well, well, at first
if one thinks rationally and carefully,
it was nothing more than
a dream like viewing
a kusazōshi (illustrated storybook).
However, since
there is such a thing as prophetic dreams,
thinking it might not be
entirely false,
generally speaking, proper
writers present what they have told truthfully for your perusal.

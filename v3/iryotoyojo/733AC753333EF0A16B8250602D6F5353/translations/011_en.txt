Takao Chisugumo is
a courtesan's mentor,
and that Usugumo's
sword-making iro (a type of courtesan)

During the fight at the riverbank,

posted in Naka-no-cho, he only

with a truly loyal character free of quirks,
and since he's one who upholds men's honor,
he bullies
tough guys and
favors
gentle ones

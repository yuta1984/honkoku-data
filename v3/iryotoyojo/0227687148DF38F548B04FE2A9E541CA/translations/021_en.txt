After a thousand years following the extinction of Entsu, a strange herb came to life and gradually consumed the fields. The countryside follows the times and greedily pursues profit, while society follows custom and specializes in loving this. Though finely chopped into thread-like pieces, it does not yet spin brocade; though smoke is briefly inhaled, it is not to seek healing. When it comes to the rise and decline of things, the sage's foresight is without error.

Mixed with dust in the Ryōbu shrine, tobacco perhaps, with soft shadows and good to drink
Emerging from the fire house of the pipe bowl, tobacco smoke, blowing rings of three wheels
Is it seducing gentle women with good-colored tobacco, seeing and tapping the mouth of the ash container?
In morning tobacco has both color and fragrance, by evening it becomes smoke and turns to ash
As one smokes, the smoldering thoughts become smoke and blow through the tobacco
Speaking of busy cutting, even a pinch has tobacco's fragrance and color excelling
If one fears not the forbidden smoking pipe, somewhere the pipe bowl too will be consumed

Kasen (Poetic Chain)

Eastern wind blows with long curtains of persimmon red　　　Keeping rhythm while cutting seven herbs
Through the window of a palanquin, piercing the mist　　　Three characters seen as one on the shop sign
Rolling tongue blows rings of moon in evening cool　　　Tasting miso in drunken stupor with loquat

Country beauty's charm called Genji in pretense　　　Dozing fragrance, also a shop friend
Even stone-splitting is helpless against the whetstone, growing gaunt　　　Never removing the moxa points
Hanging upside down from the eaves, autumn colors　　　Mist emerges from the nose in two streams
In the mouth opposite, the moon's shadow moves　　　Large bunch-like dog collar beads
Clearly Tamba Tarō speaks his mind　　　Blood-stopping potions are miraculous medicine
Pale-colored flowers' fragrance is high in the divided village　　　Drink tea later, you who change like wind

(Abbreviated below)
Cut matchcord - except for hunters, mountain cherry

Additional Poems

In the morning it is called golden thread residing in a golden pouch; in the evening it becomes ash and dust stored in a saliva bag. Not far from the northern suburbs, the pipe's
mouth sets aside impermanence and one puff is fragrant.

Who in the past cut the tobacco of the southern barbarians? Cut like threads, making small heaps in the dish. This is not the blue tube conducting wine vapors,
but should move the reed ash in the jade pipe. Mountain pleasures bring and present clouds, while flying discourse at the banquet rolls up and brings mist.
Do not ask about the arts of the Purple Yang Immortal - dining on mist and inhaling scenery, one arrives at Penglai.

Planted full in good fields, pressing down rice and hemp, harvested and arranged in ranks, combining wine and tea. The ornate knife cuts finely into golden threads
in disorder. The carved pipe burns lightly with slanted blue threads. At guest banquets assisting conversation, casting jade dust, in study curtains driving away sleep, dropping
lamp flowers. Containing joy and swallowing sorrow, people are about to grow old. Most pitiable are homes of morning clouds and evening rain.

This precious herb, same as tea, spreads throughout countless villages. Clouds and mist divide colors, especially transmitting fragrance. At pleasure banquets appreciating flowers, silver pipes lie
crosswise; welcoming the moon from high towers, wearing brocade pouches. Resentful women hold it and find peace in their thin fate; where poets pick it up, they refine their
poetic hearts. Mountain village accumulated rain most bears the flavor, further breaking loneliness. The eight interests are lasting.

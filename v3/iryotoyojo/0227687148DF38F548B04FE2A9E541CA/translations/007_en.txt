　　Tobacco Record
Since foreign visitors brought smoking pipes (kiseru), the people of Nagasaki used these as models to make kiseru from copper for smoking. Alternatively, they would make only the bowl and stem portions and connect them with thin bamboo tubes for use.

If so, reaching the present Hōreki 5, it has been approximately 160-170 years.

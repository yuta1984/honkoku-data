Preface
Since tobacco came into use in the world, one substance has many names, having both efficacy and toxicity, both benefits and harm. People of the present age use it daily as a substitute for tea and sake, never going without it, regarding it as something to be respected and loved. The "Bencao Huiyan" (Comprehensive Discussion of Materia Medica) by Ni Zhumo of the Great Qing states: "Northern people use it daily as a matter of course; when guests arrive, they immediately light tobacco and offer it to express their respect." Here we know that although Japan and China differ in land, human sentiments are the same. In recent times, those who discourse on tobacco are beyond counting. I once compiled excerpts based on what I saw and heard, amounting to several dozen pages, but now I have converted more than half into vernacular script (hiragana) to provide amusement for children and women, calling it the "Record of Tobacco."

"Hanashi Banzai" by Katsura Bunrai (author) and Miki Tangetsusai (illustrator), 5 volumes complete: This work presents various interesting stories of the present day, making readers hold their sides with laughter. As a companion for evening entertainment, nothing could surpass this.

"Kokkei Manga" by Akatsuki Shōsei, 1 volume complete: This takes all manner of contemporary items and cleverly adapts them into patterns like medium-sized textile designs, adding kyōka comic poems and miscellaneous haiku. The humor and entertainment value is beyond comparison.

"Kyōkun Dōsō" by Ryūen Shushun, 2 volumes complete (some with color illustrations): This book focuses primarily on the way of loyalty and filial piety, explaining the distinction between flatterers and wise men, encouraging self-restraint and warning against avarice, further cautioning against loose conduct and debauchery. It presents various examples of cause and effect from recent times, mixing illustrations with waka, kyōka, and haikai poetry to awaken children from their slumber all at once. This entertaining book is also suitable as gifts for young masters and ladies.

"Same, Later Volume" by the same author (recent publication), 2 volumes complete: This clearly presents various teachings omitted from the previous volume, similarly mixing illustrations to serve as an aid in guiding women. It should be sought following the previous volume. It is a book of wide benefit.

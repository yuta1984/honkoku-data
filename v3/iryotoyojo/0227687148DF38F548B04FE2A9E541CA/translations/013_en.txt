Remove some plants and let their flowers bloom to collect seeds. For all the rest, remove the top shoots to prevent flowering, and customarily remove the lateral branches between leaves, making people concentrate their energy on the leaves, which makes the leaves thick and the flavor excellent.

For each tobacco plant, the several leaves at the top are called "gairo (tochiba)." The flavor is most excellent. The subsequent leaves gradually descend in quality, and the flavor gradually diminishes. On autumn days, take the leaves, sandwich and bind them with bamboo blinds, bleach and dry them, remove the thick veins on the leaf surface, spray with warmed sake, cut the leaves into fine shapes like hair, and bundle every sixteen ryō into one package for trade throughout the realm. The names are not uniform - there are distinctions between "shinken" and "kaken," and differences between "gairo," "tōō," and "niō."

Recently, in manufacturing northern tobacco, instead of cutting it into threads, they knead raw bleached tobacco pieces into lumps, making it common like pu-erh tea and brick tea. When using it, they rub and crush it into powder and put it in tobacco pouches.

The pipes for smoking tobacco are not uniform - there are four types: gold, silver, copper, and iron.

The length is generally about seven to eight sun for bamboo pipes; short ones are one to two shaku, long ones exceed one jō. Those who favor elegance consider it beautiful when using long pipes because the smoke comes slowly.

People throughout the realm who enjoy smoking tobacco, regardless of social status or gender, substitute it for tea and sake, cannot do without it even briefly, and never tire of it until the end of their lives. Therefore, it is also called "sōshisō" (mutual longing grass).

The taste is pungent and warm, with toxicity. It treats wind-cold, rheumatic paralysis, stagnant qi, and accumulated phlegm; benefits the head and eyes; removes hundreds of diseases; and resolves the miasmic qi of mountain mists. Consuming this in frontier regions with border miasma is most suitable.

Generally, those who consume tobacco place tobacco inside the bowl of the pipe, light it, burn and inhale it to fill the mouth, and swallow the smoke. After a while, it circulates throughout the body, making the person feel comfortable throughout their entire being. Then when they exhale it, it makes the sober intoxicated and the intoxicated sober, satisfies the hungry and makes the satisfied hungry. It is the most extraordinary of foods.

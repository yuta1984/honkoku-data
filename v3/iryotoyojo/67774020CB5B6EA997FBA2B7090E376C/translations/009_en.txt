It is said that the close ones supplement their children. When children are hungry and take their mother's food, this should be reasonable. Since the Five Elements are thus, all things born from the Five Elements do not deviate from this original intention. Regarding the birth of things through the union of yin and yang, the principle is the same for both sentient and non-sentient beings. When qi is normal, there is no disease.

Qi diminishes when it scatters, but it also diminishes when it becomes depressed. Neither depressing nor scattering, simply retaining qi

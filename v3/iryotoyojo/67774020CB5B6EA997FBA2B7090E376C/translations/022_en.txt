It is dense and without gaps. Though we say that pathogenic qi takes advantage of deficiency to enter, even if a person's skin becomes deficient and loses its density, it is not like wind blowing into a house through thin cloth stretched over windows with an empty interior. When wind blows on the skin, it cools and the skin increasingly contracts and closes up. Therefore, there is even less way for wind to blow in. It is simply that when exposed to wind and cold, the surface yang qi enters inward, and the surface becomes increasingly cold. As it becomes increasingly cold, it increasingly presses inward, and because qi steams within, the interior becomes heated by this. That heat rises to the head causing headaches, attacks the lungs causing coughing, and draws clear nasal discharge to the nose. Nasal discharge occurs because the interior heats up and bubbles forth, so the steam rises to the lungs and comes out through the nose. It is like the steam from hot water. Outside is wind

and cold, while inside is heat from qi. Therefore, to disperse this outward, taking medicines of the same nature as wind qi is the principle of blowing wind internally and blowing out the qi that exists within. This qi entered inward because wind and cold blew in from outside, and likewise it is the principle of pushing it out from within using wind medicines. It is not about dispelling wind that exists within, but the principle of using wind to dispel outward the qi that was pressed inward by wind. Duhuo and Qianghuo are already called "grass that sways without wind," so they are not medicines that remove wind, but rather these medicines have the nature of wind. Fangfeng and Suye all move well, blow wind internally, and expel qi outward. When qi returns to the surface and the skin warms and sweats emerge, recovery occurs. Residual heat is the aftermath of where qi had gathered

Record of Cultivating Body and Mind

All things in nature are diseases of heaven and earth. Generally speaking, when things arise from nothingness and events occur from tranquility, these are diseases of heaven when they occur in heaven, diseases of earth when they occur on earth, diseases of the nation when they occur in the nation, diseases of people when they occur in people, diseases of plants when they occur in plants and trees, and diseases of birds and beasts when they occur in birds and beasts. To put it succinctly, they are diseases of heaven and earth.

During times of clear blue skies and bright sun, there is nothing and no events - this is when heaven is free from disease. When clouds suddenly arise, thunder roars, and lightning flashes, this is when things arise from nothingness and events occur from tranquility - that is, heaven's disease. The sudden arising of clouds is like when phlegm suddenly accumulates in a person's chest. Thunder roaring is like when fire moves in a person's belly and the intestines rumble. Clouds are water. The resonance of thunder occurs when water clouds envelop fire energy, causing fire to move and race within.

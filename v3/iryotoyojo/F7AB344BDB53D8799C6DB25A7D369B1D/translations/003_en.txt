Generally, in treating illness, one must first correctly determine its name.
Not correctly determining its name is like climbing
a tree to seek fish. The common people call hernia
"lower wind." According to Ma Xuantai's commentary on the Inner Classic,
just as accumulated earth that becomes high and large is called a mountain, hernia
means gradual accumulation. According to the Treatise on Disease Origins,
hernia means penetration. There are seven types of hernia: reversal
hernia, mass hernia, cold hernia, qi hernia, pelvic
hernia, visceral hernia, and wolf hernia. This is
Chao's classification. Also mentioned are cold hernia, water
hernia, qi hernia, blood hernia, fox hernia, scrotal
hernia, and sinew hernia, which is Zhang Zihe's
classification. Although each has a different name, their origin
is illness caused by changes in water and qi. [Seal]

It is said that unless a doctor comes from three generations of physicians, one should not take medicine,
but if one reads the medical texts of three generations, one is no different from
a three-generation physician. Therefore, not only medical families but even laypeople should
cultivate the medical way. Thus Kenkō in his
Essays in Idleness also said that the third thing
one should study is medicine. Although this book is originally
meant as entertainment, Tōzandō's Senshaku-tō decoction
is an unparalleled famous prescription throughout history, so from the benevolent heart
of wanting to spread and make it known widely
in all directions, even though it is playful, it arose from sincere thought.
Therefore, I explain the reasoning behind it.

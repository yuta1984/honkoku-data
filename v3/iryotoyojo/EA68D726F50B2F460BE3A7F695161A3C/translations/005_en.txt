Yōjō Zuihitsu (Essays on Health Preservation), Volume 1
Oral teachings of Kawai Genseki, recorded by his disciple Shinohara Etsu

In the "Hong Fan" chapter of the Book of Documents, it states: "The first of the five blessings is longevity." Longevity is what people desire. However, few people reach one hundred years of age. Even those who reach seventy have been rare since ancient times. There are also those who die young, not even reaching fifty or forty years. There are also those who die in early childhood. And there are many who fail to conduct themselves properly and meet unnatural deaths. The ancients said: "Do your utmost in human affairs and await the mandate of Heaven."

This heavenly mandate also comes through human effort, and without exhausting human effort, one can hardly speak of heavenly mandate. Mencius said: "Those who understand fate do not stand beneath a precipitous wall." If someone stands in a dangerous place beneath a steep cliff and dies crushed by falling rocks, this is not a natural death but an unnatural one.

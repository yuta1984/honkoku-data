are not equal in length. The length of those joints varies according to the size of each bamboo stalk. When people observe moderation, it differs for each person among thousands and tens of thousands. The key point for maintaining moderation in health preservation is: "What can well sustain life can also well harm it; what can well nourish oneself can also well injure oneself." To use an analogy, it is like water being able to float a boat well but also able to capsize it, and wind being able to propel a boat well but also able to overturn it. What causes capsizing and overturning is when both wind and water exceed proper limits. Thus, the way of men and women is the natural way of heaven and earth, yin and yang, and is the source of generating all things. The Book of Songs begins with "Guan Ju," stating that "the way of the gentleman originates from husband and wife." Therefore, loving beauty is universal human emotion, and this way of men and women can well sustain oneself, can well harm oneself, can well nourish oneself, and can well injure oneself. When emperors, feudal lords, ministers, scholar-officials, and commoners, according to their status, household, and country's limitations, either have empresses and concubines, or establish secondary wives, and each properly maintains moderation according to their own station, they can thereby well continue their family line, well nourish their body, well enjoy their lifetime, and well preserve their longevity. Men are nourished through women, and women through men. The way of Japanese poetry mainly sings of love, the chapters of the Tale of Genji exhaust the emotions between men and women, and Kenko said that "a man who does not love beauty feels like a jeweled cup without a bottom." The emotion of men and women loving each other is originally the emotion of heaven and earth, and it is not only humans who are thus. Stags yearn for does, and hens love roosters. Those in the world who keep birds in cages say that if they do not keep male and female together, the birds will inevitably become thin and weak. Also, if one wishes to hear their singing, by separating the cages so that male and female are apart, they will long for their mates and necessarily sing daily. This is the same as people composing songs.

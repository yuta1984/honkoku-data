Long, long ago, there lived a famous doctor whose exact name is unclear, but who was called "Katetsuho-sensei." Because he told lies about the origins of disabilities, he became known by this name. He did not specialize in speech disorders, gynecology, internal medicine, or surgery. Though he had a medicine box, he carried no medicines and did not take pulses. He was a most wondrous physician who could cure patients immediately simply by having them describe their physical condition. Many people flocked to him seeking treatment.

The Inner Canon states: "When the spirit guards the interior, how can disease enter?" Therefore, keeping the interior of the five bodies strong is the most important thing.

The pulse should not be examined. Taking a patient's hand is a bad thing to do.

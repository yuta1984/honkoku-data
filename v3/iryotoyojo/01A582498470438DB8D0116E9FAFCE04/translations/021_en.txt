　it is said, but there is no benefit to oneself whatsoever. This book honors benevolent government, considers one's proper station in life,
　does not give rise to feelings of want for material things, and will certainly make one an honest and loyal person, therefore it is beneficial and
　of great scope.
《Title: Extensive Benevolence for Emergency Relief《Note: by Master Taki Ranke》Three volumes in total》
　This book was specifically created out of concern that in remote countryside or isolated regions, or while traveling, where doctors are scarce, when sudden illness
　strikes, one might collapse and die on the spot. It is written in hiragana,
　selecting prescriptions of one or two ingredients with miraculous effects, specializing in easily obtainable medicines from plants, trees, insects, and fish,
　illustrating their appearance, and also depicting treatment methods for hanging and drowning deaths, as well as detailed
　diagrams of acupuncture points. Not only for serious sudden illnesses in adults and children, but also for various poisonings, dog bites,
　insect stings, and even burns—any ordinary person who reads this book
　can understand the treatment methods at a glance, truly enabling one to save lives and relieve suffering without waiting for a doctor.
　Therefore, everyone should possess a copy for unexpected emergencies. Moreover, these prescriptions are naturally
　selected from ancient and modern medical texts and are proven effective methods, so even medical practitioners—how could they do without this book?

《Title: 《Note: Licensed publication》Tales of National Gratitude in the Great Peace 《Note: by Kato Zaishi》Complete fifteen volumes bound in five volumes》
　This book describes how the four classes of people should never forget, morning and evening, the great benevolence and benevolent government of successive generations during this great peace. However,
　in Buddhist teaching, the four debts of gratitude are said to be gratitude to heaven and earth, to the emperor, to parents, and to teachers, as also seen in the Jitsugo-kyō.
　Now, although everyone understands the profound benevolent governance and deep benevolence of this peaceful administration,
　few people engrave it deeply and sincerely in their hearts. Therefore, this work uses everyday occupational conversations as a pretext, sometimes setting up question-
　and-answer formats, sometimes quoting the books of sages, showing the contrast between the hardships of all people in chaotic times and the
　happiness of all people under benevolent rule, with benevolent grace reaching every bay and inlet without a single neglected corner, making the gratitude for
　such benevolence clearly visible before one's eyes. Indeed, in our country there has been no disorder as long as the Ōnin War, which
　was once settled but then became chaotic again, until truly in the Genna period, through the martial virtue of the Nikkō-sama, the four seas were first pacified and
　governed. From that time to now, over two hundred years, the benevolent government of successive generations has flowed throughout the four seas, and the imperial grace has extended to birds, beasts,
　plants and trees. Neither the governance of the Engi and Tenryaku eras nor that of China's two emperors and three kings can compare to the present. Carefully considering what is described in this book,
　the four classes of people should, following the great imperial deities within and without, revere and yearn for the benevolent grace of Nikkō-sama,
　never forgetting it day or night, morning or evening. Humorous books in the world move people's jaws

Water bamboo shoots　Also called "gatsugonome." This is what is called "kojun" (water bamboo shoots), which are buds that grow from the roots of wild rice. Harvest them for use as food.
Boil until cooked and season with miso and soy sauce to eat. Alternatively, harvest the seeds, pound them into rice-like grains,
　mix with rice and wheat, and boil into porridge to eat.
Reed shoots　Called "yoshinome" or "yoshinoko." Dig up the soil in spring to harvest them. The flesh is thick and tender. They are
　superior to other varieties. Those that are exposed above ground and floating on water are not suitable for eating. Harvest young shoots, boil until cooked, and season with miso or
　soy sauce to eat. The roots are sweet. They are also good to chew and eat raw. Those that first grow from underwater
　are best.
Butterbur　Also called "watabuki" or "yama no fuki" (mountain butterbur). The leaves, stems, and flowers can all be used as food. The flowers are bitter and pungent.
　After boiling and soaking in the cooking water to bleach, then soaking in running water for one night will remove the bitterness. Leaves and
　stems have no bitterness if boiled before eating. The detoxification method is as described previously.

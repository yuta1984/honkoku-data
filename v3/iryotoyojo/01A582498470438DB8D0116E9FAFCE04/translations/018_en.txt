Pokeweed　Also called tōgobō. The taste is pungent and sour, with neutral nature but poisonous. One theory says it is bitter with cold nature. Take the white root,
　cut into pieces, boil and soak while changing water to wash clean. To prepare this, slice thinly,
　soak in running water for two nights, remove and use bean leaves as dividers in a steamer basket to steam for about six hours,
　then remove and use as food. If bean leaves are unavailable, beans may be used. This appears in the "Kōsei Yōran."
　It is also said to be good when boiled well in lye water, changing water repeatedly and soaking for two to three nights.
　The leaves should also be boiled in lye water and used as food. That people with dropsy regularly use pokeweed
　is well known.
Wild carrot　Grows in wasteland, with seedlings and leaves resembling cultivated carrot but both being small. Its
　root tastes sweet and is good eaten raw or steamed. It is also acceptable to wash clean, remove the skin, and eat raw.
Groundnut　Take the root, boil until cooked and eat. Adding salt causes no harm.

Dock seedlings (Gishigishi)　Resembles the leaves of Japanese rhubarb and Chinese rhubarb but differs from them.
　As medicinal herbs they are purgatives but greatly different. The "Jiuhuang Bencao" states to take young seedlings and leaves,
　boil and soak in water to remove bitterness, then season with soy sauce to eat. When the seeds ripen,
　pound the seeds into rice-like grains, rinse three to five times with hot water, put in a pot
　and make into porridge to eat. It somewhat upsets the stomach. One book says when tried now, the leaf taste is slightly
　sour and the root taste is bitter. No matter how much you rinse, it is difficult to eat. Leaves are fine
　just boiled.
Jujube　Should not be eaten by those with abdominal distension or emaciation. Also should not be eaten together with green onions. Can be made into noodles
　called sour jujube noodles. In spring, pick young leaves, boil until cooked, soak in water until they turn yellow, rinse clean, season with soy
　sauce or miso and eat. It is also good mixed with rice. This plant spreads its roots underground.

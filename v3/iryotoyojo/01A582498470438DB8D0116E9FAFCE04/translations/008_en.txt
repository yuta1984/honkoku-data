Okera (Atractylodes)　Take the roots, remove the black skin, slice thinly, soak in water for two or three nights to remove bitterness, then boil until cooked before eating.
Solomon's seal young shoots　Harvest young leaves, boil and change the water to soak, remove bitterness, wash clean and season with salt and soy sauce
　for eating. The roots should be bleached nine times and cooked extremely thoroughly. If not properly cooked, they will irritate the throat and be
　difficult to eat.
Sweet flag　Harvest roots that are fat, thick, and have few nodes, soak in water to remove bad taste, then boil and eat. If it comes into contact with iron,
　it will cause people to vomit and feel nauseous. If cut with an iron knife, boil thoroughly in lye water and change the water,
　soaking for two or three nights will eliminate harm.
Cattail shoots　These are the young shoots of cattail. Harvest the white shoots near the roots, twist to peel off the skin, boil until cooked, then season with soy sauce or
　miso for eating. Steaming and eating is also good. Alternatively, harvest the roots, peel off the coarse skin, bleach,
　grind like dried noodles and pound into rice cakes for eating - all methods are good.

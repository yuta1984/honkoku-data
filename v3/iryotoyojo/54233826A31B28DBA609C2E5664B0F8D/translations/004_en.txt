Long ago, at the foot of Nihonbashi, there was a doctor called "Ibuki Kunsai" who could show immediate results with moxa treatment for any difficult illness, so everyone nicknamed him the "moxa doctor." His reputation was such that even the Nio guardian deity of Himonya would throw off his large straw sandals and flee barefoot.

In the neighborhood there was a homeless vagrant who had collapsed, and the ban-taro (neighborhood watchman), landlords, and five-person groups were at their wit's end trying to deal with him. They tried to handle the matter for 200 mon, but he wouldn't agree and kept extorting them, so they asked the kunsai doctor for treatment.

The doctor said "I understand" and brought his moxa box. He administered moxa about the size of a thumb pad to the vagrant's anus, whereupon the vagrant was greatly subdued and was promptly sent off to the next district. The skill of that treatment was truly remarkable.

The townspeople were overjoyed and came to give thanks. The kunsai doctor unexpectedly concluded with "if it's about payment..."

The inn fees at tea houses paid on credit, and even the uniforms for the kamuro (child attendants), all the expenses for keeping up appearances are squeezed from Agemaki's earnings.

Sukeroku is the head clerk Shinbei. Believing that Sukeroku's dissolute behavior is entirely due to Agemaki, he thinks that if he ransoms her and makes her the flower of his shop, her behavior will improve and she'll develop a mind for business and earning money. Not knowing that their souls have switched, he agrees to pay seven hundred ryō for Agemaki's ransom and successfully redeems her, but unexpectedly, Agemaki truly declares she's "retiring from the pleasure quarters today" - a case of "stock withdrawal."

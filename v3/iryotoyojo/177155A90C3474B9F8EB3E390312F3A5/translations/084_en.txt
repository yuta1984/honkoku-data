He succeeded. When someone on Mount Kasagi observed this, they saw that the monkey trainer had made his monkey hold a gourd and float it down the river, pulling a rope while crouching beside the boat. All the ways that supernatural beings deceive people are of this type.

This happened recently. On a cold day when the evening smoke from a salt-making hut looked very lonely, a woman came carrying a child and said, "Please let this child warm himself by the fire." The salt-maker gave permission and let the child warm up. When viewed from above the furnace, it appeared to be a woman holding a child by the fire. When viewed from below the furnace, it was a fox singeing the feathers of a pheasant. They chased it away as it was and obtained the pheasant. From this we can understand something. Both illusionists and supernatural creatures have

boundaries to their power to bewitch people, and when they reach places outside those boundaries where their influence cannot extend, their true forms and original appearances are revealed. The reason the monkey trainer at Hashimoto didn't know he was being watched from Mount Kasagi, and the fox didn't know it was being observed from below the furnace, is because their supernatural energy didn't reach those places. It's like when strange beings cause thunder and lightning - they suddenly fall through breaks in the clouds. Although it's said that foxes and raccoon dogs can speak human language when driving people mad, the foxes and raccoon dogs don't actually say anything at all. What the bewitched person hears in their ears comes from their own deluded mind. The noise in one's own ears is like tinnitus that others cannot hear.

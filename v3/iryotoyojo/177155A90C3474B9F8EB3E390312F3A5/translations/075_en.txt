They become despised and make errors in treatment. They take off their shoes, lie down sideways, and engage in long conversations until late at night. When there are celebrations or wedding ceremonies, they rush to be the first to attend, acting as if they are in charge of arrangements. At wedding banquets, they wear formal court dress (jittoku), showing off their cleverness, and when caught up in the excitement of drinking parties, they sing noh chants and recite joruri, presenting an unseemly appearance. As a bad habit of such doctors, when medical treatment is needed, they make excuses saying "Well, that person is..." and fail to provide proper treatment. Since both military arts and medicine are said to be dangerous tools, it is better not to eagerly participate in celebrations and weddings, but to attend after others do. Doctors who show off through gift-giving and act obsequiously will become subordinate shrines to the god of pestilence.

One hundred bundles - when called "a messenger from the lord," he asked "Which group are you from, what is your family name?" The man answered "So-and-so from the foot soldier group." Mosai did not come out to greet him, but while holding a tea bowl in the kitchen said "Yesterday I went to the castle and was of some small service, but since I provided medicine, there is no reason to accept such gifts. Take them back quickly." The messenger was perplexed and said "Regardless of not accepting gifts, the lord has gracious intentions. Without meeting the messenger at least once, the messenger's honor cannot be maintained," and made a commotion with an angry voice. Then Mosai opened the sliding door and said "I do not speak to belittle you.

Now, relay exactly what Mosai says without error. On the battlefield, not one person who receives the lord's stipend fails to stand at the front of the lord's arrows, and there is not one person without the loyal heart to take the lord's place with their life. When he was laid low with illness as yesterday, was there anyone who helped him? I went there, but had I been half an hour later, even I would have been useless. When I went to where his fate was about to end, using the method of confronting with the same thing and taking it away, I was able to save his life - this was likely due to the merit of faith."

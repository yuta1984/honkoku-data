Even without restraint, what naturally stops is sexual desire. But one must not be careless about this. In an old tale, there was a lawsuit about the adulterous affair between a 67-year-old old woman and a 16-year-old shop apprentice that even Lord Suō found troublesome. I have seen in jōruri accompanied by shamisen the story of a 71-year-old old man and a 14-year-old girl who committed love suicide. It seems not all of these are lies.

"Even among the most humble things, there are exceptionally useful functions" - A discourse

As Han Yu said, "even cow urine, horse dung mushrooms, and the skin of broken drums" should be stored and preserved awaiting their use, leaving nothing unused - this is the excellence of medicine. One should keep in mind and remember what use cow urine, horse dung mushrooms, and broken drum skins might serve. Doctors and wives can ascend to the jade throne and golden cushions even without noble lineage. Women require chastity and beauty as essentials. Doctors require cleanliness and expertise in their art as essentials. If one wishes to be expert in the art, one should know that when, for example, a deranged patient cannot urinate or a treasured daughter suffers from genital pain, even cow dung can be useful. Long ago, during the Genna era, when a court noble suffered from difficult childbirth with labor pains, Manase so-and-so presented "hidden dragon liver" and immediately achieved safe delivery, and for this merit, Manase was granted a new family name.

It is a medicine that strengthens the qi, containing one qian of malt sugar (飴). The character for malt sugar (飴) has the food radical with the character 台. Lead (鉛) has the metal radical with the character 沿 (without the water radical). This doctor confused them because the food radical and metal radical look similar, and the characters 沿 and 台 also look similar, so he mixed them up. However, malt sugar is a warming and tonifying substance that nourishes the spleen and stomach, while lead is a cold substance that harms the spleen and stomach. It is strange that such a pitiful doctor who doesn't know the proper preparation of medicinal substances due to misreading characters should become so popular.

In our country too, there are such doctors. Not knowing that the Japanese name for quince (木瓜) is "boke," he read the characters literally as "kiuri" (cucumber). Since cucumber is called "kiuri" in Japanese, he mistakenly thought cucumber was the same as quince (木瓜). In the fifth and sixth months, he would dry many cucumbers in the blazing sun and store them to use for treating beriberi. Particularly ignorant that cucumbers should be avoided in beriberi cases, he had heard superficially that quince is used for beriberi, and foolishly thought quince was "kiuri" (cucumber). This was quite pathetic. Nevertheless, he became so popular that the coming and going of people seeking medicine blocked the roads and stopped the couriers.

Doctors' Discourse, Volume 2
Discussion on the Large and Small [Dosages] of Pharmaceutical Prescriptions

Among the students who come regularly, there is one called Shimamura Kanizō who is rather arrogant. He steps forward and says: "I have recently been reading Zhongjing's 'Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders' (Shanghan lun), and when I look at the dosages for Guizhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) and Mahuang Tang (Ephedra Decoction), I find that Guizhi Tang contains: cinnamon twig 3 liang, peony root 3 liang, licorice root 2 liang, fresh ginger 3 liang, and Chinese jujube 12 pieces. Since the Song and Yuan dynasties, including the medical texts of the Ming dynasty, it is stated that the ancient 3 liang equals today's 1 liang. In the Ming dynasty, 1 liang equals 10 monme. Therefore, the five medicinal ingredients of Guizhi Tang together amount to about 42 monme."

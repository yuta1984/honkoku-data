Indeed, as Bian Que said, what afflicts people is the multitude of diseases, while what afflicts doctors is the scarcity of therapeutic methods. Generally speaking, the methods of treatment consist only of the five approaches: sweating, purging, purgation, warming, and resolution. However, nowadays the three methods of sweating, vomiting, and purgation are set aside and not used, with only warming and tonification being considered essential, and doctors who even use harmonizing resolution are rare.

The ailments that afflict people are infinitely varied. Just as human faces are not identical, the four syndromes of qi, blood, cold, and heat are never the same, and the differences in disease patterns are impossible to fully comprehend. Among the good abilities of physicians, it is considered excellent skill to discern serious conditions from mild symptoms and to distinguish between curable and incurable cases in severe situations. I believe that when there is a serious illness in a wealthy household nowadays, many doctors are gathered to debate the disease. This is a greatly futile practice.

Patient families constantly think that all doctors' opinions are unanimous, but they are never truly in agreement. Due to professional difficulties, they secretly harbor jealousy and envy toward each other, each enduring and wanting to claim credit for themselves alone. Therefore, in gatherings of many physicians, those with authority rely on their eloquent speech to argue down other doctors. Or, even doctors who are said to be learned but have bad intentions remain flattering and silent in public without offering criticism, but work behind the scenes to obstruct others, becoming rather a hindrance. This applies not only to physicians in the marketplace, but also to stipendiary doctors and those in official service.

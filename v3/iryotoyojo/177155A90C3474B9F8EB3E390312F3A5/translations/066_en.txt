seeing that buckwheat noodles would not cook properly in a pot with seaweed, he concluded "so seaweed must aid in digesting buckwheat." However, since this has not been tested, it is difficult to determine conclusively. But rather than relying on seaweed to overeat buckwheat and drink alcohol, it is better to eat moderately and not drink alcohol after eating buckwheat. However, from what I have observed, a certain person at a travel inn overate half-cooked buckwheat noodles, then drank too much alcohol on top of that, causing stagnation in his chest and abdomen where he could neither vomit nor defecate, and died after seven days. Another person - who was moreover a doctor - overate at buckwheat noodle banquets for two consecutive days while drinking, and on the second day died suddenly right there at the gathering.

In any case, there is a folk saying: "buckwheat never reaches the point of chewing, alcohol never reaches the point of intoxication, and sexual desire has no stopping point." When buckwheat noodles fill you up to the point of wearing prayer beads, you must chew them. When alcohol fills the chest, you must breathe it out. That sexual desire has no stopping point refers to the saying "exchange wisdom for sexual desire," but one should know that sexual desire is harder to sever than wisdom. If it says to exchange for wisdom, then wisdom must be easier to endure. Originally, if one is wise, one would not drown in sexual desire, but because one is unwise, one drowns. Therefore it says "wisdom as wisdom," but even though it is said there is no stopping point, when age declines and sexual desire weakens, who would restrain

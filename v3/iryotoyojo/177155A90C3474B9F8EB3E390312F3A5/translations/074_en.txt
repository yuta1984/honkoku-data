Such qualities exist in these people as well. Samurai treat death lightly and value honor highly, so when facing battle, they forget themselves and think to stand at the forefront before their lord's arrows. Official court physicians, who constantly receive stipends and favors just like samurai, should forget personal interests and simply protect their lord's well-being day and night, not sleeping peacefully at night, not traveling far during the day, not drinking heavily, not engaging in fights or arguments, maintaining good harmony with fellow physicians, constantly engaging in medical discussions and lectures, and when their lord falls ill, all should unite in purpose to provide medical care. However, how difficult it is for many physicians to unite in purpose! For this reason,

If one wishes to hear the medical opinions of many doctors, each should submit their individual proposals in sealed envelopes to be decided by majority evaluation. However, public opinions vary widely, and with favoritism present, there are times when it becomes as difficult to decide as calling a boat a mountain. In such times, one should rely on a trusted person with learning who is honest and senior in years. This is what the common saying refers to: "Doctors, wise men, and fortunate people are the three beneficial associations." Therefore, physicians who regularly visit should have proper understanding. Since doctors approach the inner chambers, their regular visits should not be treated casually. If not careful, internal discord may arise, and if one becomes too familiar and lets down their guard through constant association, they will not be strict when treating illness and will be taken lightly.

Therefore, doctors who went there once learned their lesson and never went twice. Last year too, the young master of that house, Tokuzaemon, suffered from a serious illness, and Kansetsu of Kitayama provided lengthy treatment. Toward the end of last year, they sent someone to Kansetsu to inquire about the number of medicine doses, and he said it was 216 doses. When Tokuske heard this and calculated it at the usual rate of two bu per dose, it came to more than one piece of silver. This was quite a substantial medical fee. They sent a messenger saying they would give one roll of Kaga silk worth thirty me, but Kansetsu was greatly offended and said: "This is meant as a congratulatory gift for Master Tokuzaemon's recovery from illness, carefully prepared as ceremonial clothing, and I am grateful for the Kaga silk you have sent. However, Master Tokuzaemon's illness was both serious and difficult to treat, and I used precious medicinal ingredients to finally cure it.

Therefore, the pharmaceutical arrangements cannot be settled, so please pay for the medicine ingredients in silver. I am returning this silk for now." And he sent it back. Just then a medicine dealer arrived, so when they told him about this situation, he said: "That's three times five equals twenty-five - a great mistake! What medicine did you use?" "Kihi-to decoction, 216 doses." "That uses medicinal ingredients that have been expensive in recent years. What did you do about the ginseng?"

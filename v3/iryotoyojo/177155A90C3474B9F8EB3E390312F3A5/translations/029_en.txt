In the present age, both physicians and patients think that merely saying "supplement" is sufficient, and unlearned doctors speak as if there were no other tonifying medicines besides ginseng. Ginseng is a tonifying medicine for the qi aspect of the spleen and lungs, not a tonifying medicine for the blood aspect. Generally, there are many tonifying medicines for the qi aspect besides ginseng, and there are also many tonifying medicines for the blood aspect. As Cheng Mingyu said, "People today know that tonification can tonify but do not know that tonification can purge; they know that purging can purge but do not know that purging can tonify" - this is quite reasonable. Without understanding that within tonification there is purging, and within purging there is tonification, to solely rely on tonifying medicines is the height of ignorance and foolishness. Originally, in Xue's medical cases it says "Buzhong Yiqi Tang in the morning, Dihuang Pills in the evening." Dissolute people all rely on this and make tonifying medicines their business. Medicine should not be used when there is nothing wrong. Even Dihuang Yiqi Tang, if used when nothing is wrong, will cause hidden harm. Modern scholars mostly rely on Xue's methods. From this, medical learning has become lofty but technique has declined. The venerable Ikkei, Dosan, was skilled in technique though his learning did not match today's physicians, but Japan should specialize in Japanese learning. Looking at the old medical cases of Dosan that were in the court collection, they were all written in kana script, making them easy for women to read and convenient for patient care. The books taught to disciples, including the "Complete Nine Collections," are also written in kana.

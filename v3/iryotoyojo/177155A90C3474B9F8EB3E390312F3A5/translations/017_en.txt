When thinking that if this beloved, precious child dies, one would enter the fire together with them, and when no medicine shows any effect - at the stage where nothing but dokusanto (ginseng decoction) will serve as a restorative medicine - even if it were bellflower or dried radish, if someone said "this is ginseng," one would cling to it as something tremendously reliable. Even a sardine's head can have mysterious and wondrous effects through faith alone. If you doubt, even the sacred mantra "Abiraunken" has no power. With single-minded determination, even chanting nonsensical words like "oil bucket sowaka" as a spell, there are examples of old women stopping pain. One should not necessarily despise something just because it's fake ginseng rather than real ginseng.

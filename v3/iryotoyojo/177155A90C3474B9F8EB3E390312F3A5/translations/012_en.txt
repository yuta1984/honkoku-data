This deceives people and wastes their household wealth - ginseng does not help people but rather kills them. Though it is a useless thing, it still seems to be popular in distant rural areas. Recently fashionable doctors cannot openly state their true names, but their secret name is said to be "ginseng brokers." With four palanquin bearers, regular attendants, medicine box carriers, sandal bearers, and young servants - eight people in total making a grand procession - these doctor gentlemen obtain cheap large ginseng from药stores and present it to patients' homes as high-quality Korean ginseng. Everyone, impressed by the momentum of the palanquin, accepts it as genuine Korean ginseng. This happened last year - in Muromachi there was a man who always kept a thousand ryo in cash but lived without comfort. His only son, eighteen years old, suffered from yin deficiency and fire movement syndrome, with lung fire rising high, coughing violently. Since the master was presumptuous and extravagant, he thought there was no doctor other than this palanquin doctor, revered him as a medicine master, and from daybreak refused to show his son to other doctors, clinging to this palanquin doctor and not letting go. The palanquin gentleman also noticed the appearance, the house structure, and the kitchen smoke that showed no poverty, and after considerable observation said "you should use the ginseng I provide as a carrying fee," writing down one tael of the usual dubious ginseng for ten ryo in payment. Taking it in hand, he put two bu in each dose of monkey mochi, two doses per day for three years.

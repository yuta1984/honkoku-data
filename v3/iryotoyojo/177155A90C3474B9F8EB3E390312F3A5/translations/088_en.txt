At night they knock on gates from inside, and during the day they hire people to ask if there is a doctor named so-and-so in the neighborhood. If there are five or seven sick households, they visit fifty or seventy homes. The palanquin bearers find their pace too slow, so they hitch up their robes and run around, but things don't become popular as hoped. Thus they become discouraged. Following the way of the world, they cater to people's hearts that desire palanquins and vehicles, and force themselves to ride in vehicles, but this becomes a "cart of fire" (financial ruin). When times are hard, they borrow money from medicine suppliers, face the demands of many creditors, and eventually quietly withdraw to the end of Senbon Street or the Shimogyo Suzaku area to change professions. Among these, even a humble doctor who barely makes a living as a husband and wife selling pill medicine may suddenly become popular, and unstoppably rise to become a great medical institution, even attaining the ranks of hōgen or hōin - this is Heaven's will. What we call Heaven is really about human connections. This applies not only to doctors but to gods and Buddhas as well. We can see how stone and wooden Buddha statues suddenly become popular when their miraculous powers are proclaimed. Originally, there should be nothing mysteriously wonderful about the essence of wood and stone. Kyomizu's Kannon became enormously popular during the Daidō era through Tamura-maro's devotion. For the next three hundred years there was no word of it, then around the Genryaku era it became popular again through the spiritual power of Morihisa and Kagekiyo. After that, wars and fires continued, and it became somewhat popular again during Higashiyama-dono's time.

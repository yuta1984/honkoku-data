Turbid yin submits to pure yang, and the clarification of turbid things is the inevitable principle, so one should not doubt the remarkable effects of the thousand-volume dharani. However, giving one envelope of offerings to one monk is disagreeable. From this point, the spirit in the monk's heart becomes turbid, and his repeated departures are like avoiding the stone-throwing rope path.

With shrimp meat and octopus soup jumping about in his chest, the lumber (distracting thoughts) in the monk's heart becomes more confused than evil spirits. The same applies to doctors using medicine. Without clearly understanding the principles of yin-yang ascent and descent, cold-heat and warm-cool, they apply prescriptions that ancient people troubled themselves over, without knowing any reason, just making do with makeshift remedies.

The clerks were greatly astonished and said, "In stories we have heard that there is something called Rokuro-kubi Island in foreign countries, but we believe there is no such thing in Japan. But then, does it actually exist here in our locality? In which direction might it be?" He replied, "Not very far away, in a back shop on Hon-chō street, there is a rōnin's daughter who has good looks but suffers from this unpleasant disease. I hear that she is to be married in the coming months, so they have been searching for a doctor who can cure this illness. When they discovered that my family lineage has been treating this disease through generations of transmission, they have been earnestly requesting my help recently, so I seek this medicine. However, there are genuine and fake versions of this drug. All that came on the black ships are counterfeits. The genuine article arrived in small quantities during the Keichō era, but now there is none at all. What is regrettable is that I have run out of means to treat that patient. What I see now is a counterfeit, so it is of no use." As he was about to leave, the head clerk thought this very suspicious and said, "You must know the name of that patient's parent, but could you not tell us?"

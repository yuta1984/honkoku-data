The Lustful Drinker

When the September changeover of servants is prohibited by the authorities for about three months, one becomes even more deeply infatuated with the serving girls. He had set his heart on the plump buttocks of a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl who had just begun service this season, wearing her obi tied in back, knowing she was still a virgin. However, since her family background was respectable and though she used an alias, he was intimidated by her stern expression and had never even held her hand, conducting himself as a most upright and steadfast master. But at a tanomoshi gathering at Saishōan temple, he got foolishly drunk from the organizer's hospitality. On his way back, instead of settling down in Sakamachi or Dōtonbori as planned, he was dragged home by his teetotaler companions. His wife was already asleep, and when he caught a glimpse through his drunken eyes of that very servant girl opening the gate with a paper torch in her hand, he lost all sense of propriety and forced himself upon her. That single incident became his downfall - now he feels nauseous like someone craving unripe plums, completely drained of everything, and considering his mother-in-law and his wife's feelings... truly, sake is not separate from the heart!

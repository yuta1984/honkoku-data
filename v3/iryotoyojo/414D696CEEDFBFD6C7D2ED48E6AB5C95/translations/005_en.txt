　　　The Diligent Drinker

The "diligent drinker" type is one who regularly associates with people of higher social standing and joins their drinking parties. When the mood strikes, they may drink heavily, but they never engage in vulgar behavior such as speaking ill of others, being rude, or acting improperly. Since they drink not from physical appetite but for other purposes, even when faced with delicious food, they do not eat excessively. Even though their drinking spirit is good, they do not greedily pursue alcohol, and because they drink while maintaining their composure, they never become disheveled or collapse from drunkenness. Depending on the atmosphere and excitement of the gathering, they have hidden talents they have mastered - perhaps dancing, performing joruri puppet theater, mimicry, singing kouta songs, or playing the shamisen.

They truly add to the enjoyment of the gathering. However, unlike professional entertainers (houkan) who hold court, they maintain proper etiquette throughout, and no matter what kind of heavy drinker they encounter, their skillful methods of handling the situation cannot be acquired through just a day or two of practice. This is why they are called "diligent drinkers," but such a character cannot be easily manufactured or constructed. It becomes a natural habit, and even when drinking with peers and friends of equal standing, they never abandon this mindset. This should be called a type of extraordinary drinker.

The Talkative Drinker

When sober without any alcohol in their system, people keep their hearts locked away in inner chambers, wearing faces as if they've sucked on bitter persimmons. But once they've had five or six cups, their tongues somehow loosen, and as the sake continues to flow, they launch into unsolicited personal stories, gossip about others, and worldly chatter, speaking in voices so loud they could make the deaf hear. Indeed, the difference between their state when drinking and their usual gloomy demeanor is as vast as heaven and earth, clouds and mud - as different as wooden clogs and grilled miso paste. At such times, even the mountain god's wife would bring over warmed sake.

Even such talkative drinkers inevitably have subjects they struggle with. When the conversation turns to scholarly matters, they somehow lose their vigor and from that point say absolutely nothing, with some even resting their head on their hand and falling asleep. Similarly, when talk turns to tea ceremony, discussions of calligraphy and painting, or any somewhat refined matters in fields unfamiliar to them, even the most talkative will predictably fall completely silent.

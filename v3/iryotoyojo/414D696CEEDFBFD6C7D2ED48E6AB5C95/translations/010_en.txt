The Laughing Drinker

The laughing drinker is a rare thing in this world. I have spent several years as a sage of wine, attending banquets in various places, but I have yet to see a true laughing drinker. When people drink and engage in cheerful conversation, that is ordinary behavior and cannot be called a drinking habit. A real laughing drinker is someone who doubles over with laughter at things that aren't even funny, almost like suffering from a disease called "laughing palsy," unable to control themselves.

I once drank with someone who could be called a laughing drinker. He kept stroking a bearskin futon with his hand and laughed outrageously. A person nearby, quickly catching on, said, "I trust your wife is doing well too" - thinking it was that old story. When I suggested this, the man shook his head and said, "No, that's not it. It just looks so much like my son Shichizo's big round head that it's hilarious," and he doubled over with laughter.

Such people who laugh at things that aren't even funny are indeed precious and rare.

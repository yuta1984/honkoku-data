The Porter Drinker

Even on the hottest days of summer's peak heat, or the coldest nights of harsh winter, wearing only torn tabi socks and a single short coat, carrying loads on bamboo shoulder poles and making the tenements their lodging with a carefree lifestyle - this is called a kumasuke (porter). Among drinkers, there's a type nicknamed "porter drinker" because their behavior at drinking gatherings is vulgar and they cannot sit properly in polite company.

First, when beginning to drink, they find the currently fashionable small Rikyū-style cups troublesome, and from the start use large stone-like vessels to gulp down alcohol. They take side dishes like abalone, kamaboko, or teppo-ae (a type of salad) and yakko tofu with soy sauce mixed with green peppers, throw everything into one container, and eat by passing it around from the edges - doing nothing but things that refined people would never do. Moreover, they get drunk quickly, and by the time the sea bream rice comes out from the kitchen, no amount of shaking or rousing will wake them. When occasionally forced awake, they become sick at the very sight of alcohol.

They grab the serving women, geishas, or waitresses, knocking them over and rolling them around, stepping on and breaking shamisen, spilling water from bowls, completely killing both the entertainment and the drinking mood. It always ends in arguments and terrible scenes. These should be classified as the vulgar behaviors of drunkards.

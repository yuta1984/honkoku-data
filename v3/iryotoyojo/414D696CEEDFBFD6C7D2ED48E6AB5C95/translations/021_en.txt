The Sleepy Drinker

On peaceful spring days, carrying lunch boxes and small bamboo flasks, treading on young grass in the fields while skylarks sing high overhead, spreading a felt mat and beginning to drink - even teetotalers would envy such scenes. Then in summer evenings, poling a river boat, floating sake cups on the flowing water while fireworks bloom in the sky - such beauty is beyond description. In autumn, mushroom hunting in the northern mountains while drinking among the bush clover and autumn leaves, and in the bitter cold of winter, gathering around the hearth where kindred spirits come together to warm and serve sake - these too represent the ultimate earthly pleasures.

Besides these, whether at pleasure quarters or theaters, enjoying snow, moon and flowers, at celebrations or funerals, or mediating quarrels - everything becomes interesting only when accompanied by drinking. Then, becoming somewhat intoxicated and relaxed with each other, sharing things usually left unsaid and unheard, in the midst of such amusing and delightful moments, there are drinkers who collapse and sleep, snoring very loudly. While this causes no harm, it greatly diminishes the pleasure of drinking.

Fellow drinkers call this "a state of complete senselessness."

The Disgraceful Drinker

What is written in the "Tsurezuregusa" as "doing unspeakable things and scattering them about" refers to what we now call a disgraceful drinker. Indeed, vomiting is the point where a drinker's momentum reaches its peak, equivalent to a warrior's death in battle. There is also a type of person who, in order to drink more, sticks their finger down their throat, forcibly vomits, and then returns to drinking. This cannot be called heavy drinking.

It is the same as temporarily making one's belly a lodging for food and drink, only to soon expel it. Although vomiting may be considered one of the diversions of drinkers, it is vulgar behavior and an unseemly act for a heavy drinker.

The Overstaying Drinker

With cups, trays, and stands, along with appetizers and sweets already served, from salted fish to Bizen pottery sake vessels - such complete hospitality with nothing left wanting. When the host and guests unanimously suggest "Now please accept this final cup" and move to the cleanup phase, this type declares "Now the real drinking begins!" They chatter away mindlessly, oblivious even to the sake server nodding off. This greatly troubles the kitchen staff, as there's never a moment's break from the stench of vomit and nausea. This is called "overstaying drinking," and while teetotalers intensely dislike such behavior, it's really just another manifestation of loving sake. Once they've drunk as much as they want, they find it bothersome to remain at the gathering - such drinkers are truly pathetic.

The Conceited Drinker

"Unubore" (conceit) is an Edo dialect term that means the same as what Osaka people call "miso wo ageru" (showing off). There are few people in this world without conceit. Some take pride in their wit, others boast of their artistic talents, claim expertise in matters of love, or believe themselves superior in appearance - each person, according to their station, falls in love with themselves. Yet when sober, they exercise restraint and don't voice such thoughts, but when intoxicated, their true nature emerges as they brag about how courtesans supposedly flirted with them.

However, when you actually ask the courtesans in the pleasure quarters, these men are nothing more than ordinary customers. Yet the person who criticizes them saying "What terrible conceit!" is also conceited, those who come are conceited, and those who leave are conceited. Since we live in a world overflowing with conceit, you can well imagine that this author's conceit should also be understood.

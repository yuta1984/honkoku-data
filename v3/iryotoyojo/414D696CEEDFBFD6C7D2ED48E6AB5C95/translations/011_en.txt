The Crying Drinker

A crying drinker is not someone who simply starts crying as soon as they drink alcohol. Since alcohol fundamentally reveals a person's true nature, those who usually harbor discontent in their hearts, or hold grudges against others, or feel frustrated inside—when they find themselves in pleasant company with like-minded friends, engaging in lively conversation, with good food and soup to accompany their drinks, and they drink deeply—become more intoxicated than usual. When casual talk about the floating world and gossip about people suddenly strikes the core of their resentments, they pour out everything in their hearts, shedding tears like rolling pearls, forgetting how others see them and their reputation, and break down crying.

This only happens to people who combine an essentially honest nature with irritability and stubbornness, and who are also heavy drinkers—only such people reach the point of crying.

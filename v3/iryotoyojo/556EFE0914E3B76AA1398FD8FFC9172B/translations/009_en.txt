Preface to Essential Treatise for Patient Families
Medicine is the weapon for treating illness, and the physician is the general who repels disease. When the country is well-governed, weapons of war are not deployed; when people are healthy, medicinal stones are not used. Throughout history, there has never been a good general without effective weapons, just as there has never been a good physician without divine medicines.

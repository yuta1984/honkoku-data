From this I make my considerations. Furthermore, for structural divination (kensō), I measure the frontage and depth of the house construction in ken, and take the center point to establish as the central point of the building. I record everything: storehouses, granaries, storage buildings, warehouses, detached rooms, hidden residences, areas in front of gates, all openings, along with their measurements, locations for cattle and horses, the layout of enclosures, various entrances and exits, walls, fences, the overall structure, the heights of roofs, the distance from the main house to the storehouse, the distance to the gate - recording all distances completely, as well as the garden areas, beyond the gate, the flow of rainwater, and documenting all these details. Now for house divination (kasō), I examine: the main room of so many ken by so many ken, the next room, storage rooms, kitchen, the arrangement of tatami mats in all rooms, wooden floors, the condition of verandas, door storage spaces, sliding doors, paper screens, entrances, alcoves, staggered shelves, bag shelves, closets, Shinto altars, Buddhist altars, decorative objects, inner gardens - everything without exception. Generally, I take the center point of the tatami-floored areas as the central point and main seat for house divination. This is called the three forms of divination: land divination, structural divination, and house divination. Usually I consider from the central point of the house divination.

If there is careful examination needed, I also consider the central point of the structural divination. For extremely careful examination, I combine all three, including the central point of the land divination. In such cases, I use what is called a "raised diagram," which can be prepared if you commission a carpenter. Small houses do not require such measures. Such diagrams are completed three days after submission. Furthermore, details will be provided in the latter part of the charitable book. As described above, I consider everything thoroughly, combining three methods of consideration, and only then do I provide my judgment. Using only one method can lead to oversights. My approach involves recording all various considerations and methods that lead to beneficial outcomes, then sealing them with my seal, so there is nothing crude about it. Unlike others who speak carelessly, causing the client to mishear, forget, or misremember - which would be unfortunate. Especially problematic would be later claiming "I didn't say such a thing," which would be against my principles. Therefore, I have everything recorded step by step from the beginning, making this consideration the first priority.

Those who say
　various things about me
　are just being sore losers
　　Try to imitate even
　　one percent of what I do

The above is certainly not boasting. I write this from my shallow thinking, believing that if I maintain my resolve so my heart does not waver, and if spirits are lifted, it would be good for all of us.

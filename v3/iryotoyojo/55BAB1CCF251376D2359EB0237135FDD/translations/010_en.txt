exists. Otherwise, essential matters become secondary, and if one also includes things that are not currently necessary, it becomes inconvenient. From the great river over there, one should be considerate of crossing the small river before one's eyes. If there are matters of great importance, I seal them in letters with my name written on them, so that intermediaries do not open them, and there is absolutely no disclosure to others. Now, the way of thinking of those who make their living [by divination] is to praise everyone. They get mired in this and depend on it. If things go as they say, it would be fine, but when they don't, it's like having one's husband stolen by a maid. Particularly, they say compatibility is bad and have people break off relationships, say the house is bad and have them move, or have them sell off fields and residential land, remove storehouses, and otherwise greatly disturb the household. This is entirely due to shallow wisdom. Even without doing such things, one should pray for forgiveness for divine retribution and focus on driving away obstacles. Poor fortune can be supplemented, and for the seven calamities and eight sufferings, and anything else regardless, if prayers are offered according to their respective severity and one's circumstances, there will be mysteriously beneficial effects. If there are no

benefits, it is because the ritual officiant lacks virtue, so it is better to request this from others. However, the Outline says "Life exists in food." If that is so, unless the ritual officiant's virtue, the person's faith, and food combine as three elements, it appears that extreme difficulties are hard to escape. Longevity depends on food, strength and weakness depend on food, onset of illness depends on food, serious illness depends on food, whether various medicines are effective depends on food, death depends on food. Also, poverty and wealth depend on food. If this is so, the management of good and bad foods is of primary importance. Now, those who have accumulated various books about foods can collect and read them, but what about poor people? This is truly lamentable. Therefore, I arrange this in an easy-to-read format, organized by the Japanese syllabary, and make it a charitable book. If people lend this to sick households and such, there is no greater hidden virtue than this. Now, although there are many varieties of foods, what is good for one aspect may be bad for another, and there may be interference with various medicines. Additionally, there are errors from misremembering or misspeaking, which lead to confusion. Therefore, not only for ordinary people but even for sick people, I include only what helps rather than hinders or obstructs. Nevertheless, even the reeds of Naniwa and those of Ise

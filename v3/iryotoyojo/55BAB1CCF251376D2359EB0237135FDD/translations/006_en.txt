...making a living in the asura realm, making a living through duplicity, making a living with sincere heart, making a living with evil heart, making a living with hidden virtue, and making a living with thievish heart. Among these twelve stages, one makes a living according to what one prefers. The paper scrap collector said: "I entered this path unwillingly." I replied: "You appear to be merely honest but poor in conduct. Henceforth, from the morning hour of six (6 AM) for half an hour, do what is called 'ground searching' - go around picking up things that people dropped the previous night. Then do your usual paper scrap collecting. Also, from evening six o'clock to four o'clock during rainy weather, do rice hulling for pay, work as a courier, and serve as a town messenger. For the benefit of both parties, honesty is best in all cases. Though this is the work of three people, house rent and various expenses remain the same. If you do this, in ten years you can accumulate five or ten kan of silver. Use that money for business, don't forget your former paper scrap collecting, and if you persevere, you will accord with heaven's principle, and acquiring three or five houses will require no effort at all."

Everyone acts only according to their own convenience, so they ruin their fortune. Then they fail in their obligations to others and exhaust their spirit, becoming sickly. Dead things are exceptional - there is not one thing between heaven and earth that does not move. For people, working is medicine. Blood and qi circulate well, there are no worries at year-end settlements, and living pleasantly in all things naturally leads to freedom from illness and longevity. I do not speak of my own poor understanding, but pretending to know what others know, or criticizing one's superiors, is like a nearsighted person looking through the wrong end of a telescope. Though I can understand the arts of those below me, I can hardly understand any of the arts of my superiors. This is called "beyond one's sight." Speaking such criticism is like a deaf person eavesdropping. Rather than speaking of others' mistakes, it is better first to guard against one's own faults. This is called clarity.

For one who thinks of clouds that hide the sun and moon, polish yourself and the above will be clear.

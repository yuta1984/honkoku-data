Birthing chairs provide no benefit and are rather harmful. Also, in homes without birthing chairs, they surround three sides with chests or straw bales, make the parturient woman sit inside, prevent her legs from extending, and also surround the front side, strictly restricting her for one seven-night period, not allowing her to sleep comfortably. Thinking this is postpartum care is a great mistake. I believe that in recent times, there are those whose legs remain bent and cannot extend after childbirth, and those whose backs curve due to lower back pain. This is likely because, in many cases, they sit formally for long periods after childbirth, causing bad blood to stagnate and fresh blood not to circulate. I will illustrate how to make the parturient woman lie down in the lower volume. This should be referenced together.

Six: Regarding medicines to be used during childbirth
Because medicines used during childbirth are called "催生" (labor-inducing), some people think that using medicine will lead to quick birth, and they exclusively use medicine to hasten delivery. This is because they do not know that childbirth follows natural principles. For those with strong bodies and no other ailments, there is no harm in not using medicine. However, if the body is weak, medicine should be used to support the qi and blood. Kyuki-to (Chuanxiong and Angelica Decoction) is recommended.

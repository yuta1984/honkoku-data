Seeing that the pulse is deep and the hands and feet are cold, people panic and make a commotion, thinking it is generally dangerous, and carelessly overuse preparations of ginseng and aconite, sometimes causing harm instead.

○The wife of a certain Confucian scholar in Kyoto gave birth facing the sunlight in a house with shallow eaves after a fire. Blood dizziness suddenly occurred. Since the condition was severe, surgical procedures were attempted and large amounts of ginseng decoction were used, but there was no effect. Since the placenta had not yet descended, a certain physician greatly feared this as a fatal condition. However, the husband realized that "since she is exhausted after childbirth and her body is weakened, this condition probably occurs because sunlight is striking her." When he quickly blocked the sun with doors, the blood dizziness subsided after a while. One should understand such cases beforehand.

○On summer days, since parturient women suffer from heat, they sweat and feel oppressed in the chest, with qi rising upward, so blood dizziness occurs frequently. First, open the shoji screens to create coolness, sprinkle water in the garden, reduce the number of people nearby, and ensure the living room does not become stuffy.

The four conditions including blood dizziness are common after childbirth, so one should beforehand apply one's mind to medical knowledge and master these matters. The medicines to be used are recorded here.

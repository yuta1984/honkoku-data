become ill. This is absolutely untrue. Since cutting a child's hair at the end of three months after birth

with disturbed breathing, hoarse voice, and die.
People do not understand what causes this and simply call it "intestinal worms"

Nine: Things to watch for in a newborn's mouth
When a child is born, attention should be paid to the mouth. If there is a white swelling
on the upper jaw, it should be punctured with a needle, and the white rice-like substance
inside the swelling should be removed. If one neglects to puncture it, it becomes difficult to remove and may harm the child.
Sometimes white spots appear on the gums. This is called "horse teeth."
Often the child cannot nurse properly, so it should be quickly punctured to let out blood. There is also
a condition called "double tongue," commonly known as "kojita," where red
flesh grows under the tongue like pomegranate seeds. The muscle under the tongue should be quickly pricked to let out blood.

From conception until delivery, there are prohibitions in all things, it is said. Therefore in ancient times there was something called prenatal education (taikyō), where pregnant women would not look upon improper sights with their eyes, nor listen to lewd sounds with their ears, and such teachings existed. If the mother's heart turns toward good, the child in her womb will benefit from this and become a good person; if it turns toward evil, the child will be influenced and become a bad person. However, people of recent times do not know that there is reason in such influence, and say in proverbs things like "that pregnant woman over there ate rabbit meat, but her child was not born with a cleft lip," or "the wife here witnessed a fire, but the child born had no red birthmarks." This is being overly rigid in one's thinking, and it is wrong not to avoid all things that should be avoided.

During the Genroku era, the great scholar Asami So-and-so was living in Edo when he encountered a house fire. A cat kept in his house was pregnant at the time, but because the fire was sudden, it lost its composure in fleeing and ran into the flames. However, fortunately it saved its life and escaped. When things settled down, they caught that cat. All the hair on its entire body had been burned off, leaving it completely bare. Later it gave birth to four kittens, and it is said that those kittens' fur was burned and all their hair tips were completely frizzled. Seeing this, prenatal education must not be abandoned.

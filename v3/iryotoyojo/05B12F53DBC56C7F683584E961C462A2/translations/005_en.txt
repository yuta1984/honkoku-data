Most people in the world do not enjoy reading books, and physicians are also unable to provide sufficient instruction and guidance. Therefore, they remain ignorant of the principles of pregnancy and childbirth, and act contrary to proper methods of seasonal care and nourishment. Consequently, they frequently encounter breech births and transverse presentations, and—how lamentable—cry out in agony during the night. Who would not feel pity for such suffering? Kojima Naoyoshi of Harima, constantly moved by compassion for this situation, compiled the essential points of various wise men's works and wrote them in kana script, organizing them into three volumes. Covering prenatal education, prenatal care, labor induction, infant care, and various postpartum ailments, everything is included without omission. Even village midwives and local women can easily read and understand it.

If people regularly study this book at home, they will have nothing to worry about or fear during emergencies. Each birth will be successful, and there will surely be joyous celebrations. Kiyo Shukusenri of Naniwa sent a letter requesting my words. I greatly praise his compassionate heart in rescuing the common people and the circulation of this obstetric treasure in the world. Therefore, I do not decline to write this preface at the beginning to honor Naoyoshi's meritorious work in supporting moral transformation.

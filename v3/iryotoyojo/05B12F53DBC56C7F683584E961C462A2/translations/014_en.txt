It was already spread to the world in the first year, but before many years had passed, the old printing blocks were completely destroyed by fire. This time I have renamed it "Hahakogusa" (Mother and Child Grass) and am publishing it again. Since the name is different but the meaning is the same, I mention this here in case readers might have doubts.

The fact that women conceive children is a natural constant of heaven and earth, so it has been determined since heaven and earth first opened. In the Book of Changes it states: "Heaven and earth intermingle in harmony, and all things are transformed and purified; male and female unite their essence, and all things are transformed and born." That there are male and female among humans is like there being yin and yang in heaven. Heaven is above and represents the male position. Earth is below and represents the female form. Heaven gives and earth produces - this is the principle by which husband and wife unite in harmony to bear children.

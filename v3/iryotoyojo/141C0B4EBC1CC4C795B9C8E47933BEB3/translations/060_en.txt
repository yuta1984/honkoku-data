If even a little remains, it will inevitably cause suppuration, so after thoroughly removing it, one should light a paper twist or wooden splint coated with oil, drip oil into the wound, and then apply a mixture of lead white kneaded with wax and oil on top. Making a mixture of raw egg and oil is also good.

▲Double tongue is a condition where swelling appears under the tongue as if another tongue were layered there, gradually extending. Inside this is a pale pink liquid containing viscous water mixed with a little blood. If there is no medical lancet, one can use a small knife to cut the skin and drain the fluid, which will heal on its own. Since applying medicine inside the mouth is inconvenient, it need not go that far, but applying a fine powder of about 2-3 bu of borax mixed with 5-6 rin of calcined alum is also good. Powdered lead sugar is also effective.

▲Vaginal discharge is a women's disease. White viscous fluid flows out. When this is mixed with yellow, foul-smelling fluid, it comes from women who have had intercourse with men suffering from syphilis and gonorrhea, contracted syphilis, and developed sores at the cervix, causing pus to mix with the discharge. Therefore, it is difficult to cure with ordinary treatment methods. In any case, when this disease manifests during travel, it causes difficulty in walking. At such times, one should steam-wash every evening with hot water in which about 2-3 monme each of cnidium seed, fennel, and Job's tears flowers have been soaked. Reduce salt intake, avoid rich and oily foods, and if barley and red beans are available, use those. For internal medicine, the Miwa Shinko preparation mentioned in the later section on edema can be used. If it is ordinary vaginal discharge not caused by syphilis, using diuretic medicines will provide swift recovery. For cases accompanied by urinary dribbling and pain at the urethral opening, one can decoct 2 monme of peach gum with 7-8 bu of licorice, or grind walnut meat, add sugar, and dissolve in hot water for use. Alternatively, roasting barley with plenty of licorice and decocting it is also good.

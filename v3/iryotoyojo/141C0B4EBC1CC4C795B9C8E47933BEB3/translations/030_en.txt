Using only those medicinal formulas makes it difficult to cure modern beriberi. Modern beriberi is mostly caused by poor digestion in the intestines and stomach, leading to poor urination due to water retention, and when this progresses to press against the chest and abdomen and even affects the heart, it is not the same as the beriberi that was epidemic during the Tang dynasty, which had evil toxins that could transmit from person to person.

For modern beriberi where the body is swollen with edema and water has accumulated in the chest and abdomen, causing spasms and cramping so severe that one cannot even lie down, there is no choice but to drain the water to save the patient from danger. For a readily available water-draining remedy, combine three monme of buckthorn seeds with one monme each of costus root, dried ginger, and evodia, making six monme as one dose. Boil this in two gō of water down to six shaku, and using two or three doses will drain water through the bowels and relieve the heart pressure.

If the situation is urgent, use about three bu of orpiment (used by painters) with ginger juice added to hot water. Since this substance tends to easily induce vomiting, to prevent this, add a little water and dissolve it over fire, then add about three times as much powdered dried ginger to make pills. Taking these with a decoction of two to three monme of jujube dates will prevent vomiting.

Also, depending on the condition, some cases should be treated with aconite preparations, and some should use aconite preparations after first draining the water. Since the changes in the disease are not fixed, the prescriptions are also not uniform. Therefore, here I have only recorded what should be done to save patients from immediate danger.

However, the proper treatment method is to direct water retention through urination, and leading it to the bowels is not desirable. When treating beriberi with heart involvement using areca nut, chaenomeles fruit, evodia, inula flower, rhinoceros horn, perilla leaves, and other medicines totaling barely two monme per dose, if it is cured, this is not because the medicine was effective, but because the disease was mild and healed naturally. One should well distinguish this reasoning.

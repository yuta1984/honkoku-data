It is also used for retained fluids (accumulation of water in the chest) and is particularly effective when used for childhood malnutrition disorders (kanshitsu). Since there are various distinctions in the treatment methods for dysentery, what is described here should be understood as merely showing convenient methods among the initial treatment approaches for excess-type dysentery.

For dysentery in general, what is effective is the charred preparation of soapberry (mukuroji). This is prepared by placing both the skin and fruit as they are into an earthenware pot, tying it in a cross pattern with copper wire, sealing the gaps in the lid with mud mixed with a little salt, and burning it with fire. The result is taken out, ground into fine powder, and used repeatedly at one monme per dose. Also, the charred preparation of mole is effective for various types of dysentery, so these should be prepared in advance and carried during military campaigns or travels. The charred soapberry is also effective for diarrhea caused by poor digestion in the intestines and stomach. I have heard that in certain domains, the lords themselves have traditionally prepared this and distributed it widely.

For blisters caused by chafing from straw sandals, break the blister to drain the fluid, then mix equal parts of burned red whelk shell and pinellia into fine powder, combine with rice paste, and apply - this will heal it. It is also good to apply fish glue plaster or the commonly known "instant effect paper" mentioned in the wound treatment section later.

Beriberi sometimes begins without any swelling in the legs, with the legs simply feeling heavy and causing difficulty in walking. Sometimes it starts with swelling from the ankles, spreads throughout the body, and increasingly prevents urination. In all cases, there is numbness in both legs. If during military campaigns or travels there is poor urination, weak legs, and numbness of the skin, one should quickly use the urination-promoting medicine of Miwa Shinko mentioned in the later section on edema, observe its contraindications, and promptly restore smooth urination. The beriberi that in ancient Tang times spread from Lingnan, the far south, and gradually transmitted northward, was a type of epidemic disease, and since its pathological cause differs greatly from modern beriberi,

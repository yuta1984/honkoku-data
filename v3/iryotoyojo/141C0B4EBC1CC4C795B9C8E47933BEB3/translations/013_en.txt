this should be understood. However, during travel or military service, immediate relief becomes necessary, so I shall transmit a moxibustion method that can treat this without causing future harm. Feel with your fingertips for the end of the spine - there is a bone below that is pointed and moveable. This is commonly called the "turtle's tail." Move this bone aside and apply seven moxa cones daily for about seven days to the slightly depressed area beneath it. The itching will immediately stop and become bearable. If you continue daily moxibustion at this point without neglect, there is no need for topical medicines or internal remedies, and it will heal without future harm - this is miraculous. This moxibustion also has effects superior to medicine for swelling and pain of hemorrhoids and non-healing anal fistulas. It has also proven effective for persistent diarrhea, hernia, spasmodic conditions, and consumptive disorders, so it should not be treated lightly. ▲For damp and itchy genitals, gather houttuynia cordata growing in fields or roadsides (dried forms are available at medicine shops), decoct in water and wash with it. Using plantain leaves or chrysanthemum stems and leaves is also good. Sprinkling cattail pollen or sulfur flowers used in gunpowder (also available at pharmacies) is also effective. ▲For lice in the genital area, commonly sprinkle calomel after bathing. ▲For chafed vaginal opening, grind cuttlefish bone or eggshell to fine powder and mix with egg white to apply. ▲For sudden paralysis of shoulder and back, break a nearby teacup or similar object and scrape the tense area of the shoulder to draw much blood. If time passes and blood stops flowing, death may occur, so speed is essential. Then give about one gō of fresh water to drink. When somewhat settled, use a purgative to induce bowel movement. This condition can suddenly onset when one thinks half the shoulder feels blocked, and death can occur without treatment, so quick action as described can provide rescue. ▲For toothache, there are various types, but detailed discussion is not recorded here. For cavity pain, use squeezed daikon radish juice or grate wasabi and apply the juice to the painful area.

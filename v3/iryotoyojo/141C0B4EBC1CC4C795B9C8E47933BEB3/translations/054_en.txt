without being hasty, with a calm heart and devoted compassion, handling gently without roughness. However, those whose tongues protrude, who drool from the mouth and leak feces are difficult to save.

▲For fractures and dislocations, pulling and stretching the displaced joint connections is the ultimate secret transmission of orthopedic medicine. For shoulder bones, either pull downward, or take it backward and rotate it forward while pulling. For the elbow, place the left hand against the ribs and pull with the right hand. For any joint, once you understand that if you pull in one direction, it will engage in the other direction, there is no bone in the body that cannot be set. Thus, orthopedic medicine can have its secret fully explained in one statement, which is why orthopedic disciples are reluctant - there is nothing else to transmit. When joints are dislocated, if you understand this principle well and treat it promptly, there will be little swelling, and it will heal as is, returning to its original state. Vinegar dissolves blood, while alcohol coagulates blood, so for all contusions and fractures, it is good to add camphor to vinegar, warm it slightly, and apply as a poultice.

However, when orthopedic practitioners use alcohol to prepare topical medicines, this is a misunderstanding. Also, when bones of the upper arm, elbow, thigh, or shin are broken, wrap many layers of cotton soaked in vinegar, then wrap with thick phellodendron bark that has been soaked in hot water, and bind it tightly over that. For thigh injuries, arrange for urination and defecation to be done while lying down; for hand injuries, have others feed the patient, ensuring no movement whatsoever. After two or three days pass, it will naturally reconnect, and within ten days or so will return to normal. The supreme wonder of the divine mechanism of heaven and earth's creation is truly astonishing. Thus recording the secrets of orthopedic medicine indiscriminately may be questionable toward practitioners, but for those who might encounter unexpected disasters while traveling, [I record] this much.

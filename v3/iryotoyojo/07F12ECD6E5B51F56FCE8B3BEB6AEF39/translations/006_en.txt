When drinking water, one should not seek flavor, nor desire to fill the stomach.
The health preservation method I expound here, though not yet able to enjoy natural foods in their pure form, still seeks to return to the customs of ancient times through contemplation. What does it mean to moderate food and drink? That is: not seeking flavor, not desiring a full stomach, always eating cold foods, drinking water, deliberately not eating warm or hot foods, and never consuming salt. This is the custom of ancient times and is now the foremost excellent method of health preservation. Moreover, for nourishing life, there is nothing better than eating cold foods, and nothing more harmful to life than eating warm foods.

Water is fundamentally the basis of nourishment, while fire is fundamentally the beginning of transformation. If something is born, it grows; if it transforms, it dies. Therefore, nothing changes the natural state of things more severely than fire. Moreover, among all things born between heaven and earth, there is probably nothing that can maintain life apart from water. Birds, beasts, insects, and fish, and indeed all things down to plants and trees, all use water as nourishment. Yet humans constantly drink hot water. Is there anything between heaven and earth, apart from humans, that should be nourished with hot water? I have never seen such a thing. When hot water is poured on plants, they wither; when poured on birds and beasts, their flesh rots and decays. Even warm water does this, much less boiling water. [marginal note: oneself] Recently...

Divine Land Restoration Guide to Health Preservation - Written by Fukken Dōshi Gyokkai

Generally, the way to nourish life lies solely in moderating food and drink. As for the thousand-year crane and ten-thousand-year turtle (secrets of longevity), I do not yet know these. Originally, in the age of our Divine Land's (Japan's) founding ancestral deities, people enjoyed natural foods and each lived for tens of thousands of years. From the beginning, there was no hardship or illness. Gradually, as the world developed and people gained wisdom, they gradually lost their natural way and began to harm human life. What do we call "natural"? That is, never having eaten food cooked with fire, and never having eaten mixed combinations (of different ingredients). They ate all varieties of living things in their pure state and consumed only their vital essence.

From atop the platform, she dove into the water with a splash. The spray that shot up dissolved away like ephemeral foam bubbles that remain for a moment, and as her precious life thread snapped and faded away, the boat suddenly erupted in commotion. Voices cried out "Yaegiri has drowned!" but there was no answer. Though they had people search here and there among the storm-blown waves, it was entirely to no avail. Kikunojō, through his tears, showed his resolve to also drown himself, saying "With circumstances I cannot openly speak of, it would be difficult to maintain honor while living." Though unaware of the full situation, Heikunojō was alarmed by this state and restrained him, saying, "Indeed, though we call this a pleasure boat outing that you arranged, Yaegiri's drowning is ultimately an unexpected accident. Since we too were all together on this boat, this is not your fault alone. We should report to the authorities, and in any case, we should all stay together." Yosahachi, the boatman, and all the others exhausted their words to restrain him. With a heart too painful to speak openly of, shedding constant tears, they relied on their large boat to search here and there among the waves, but her form was nowhere to be found, carried away by the indifferent waters. Though he prayed to the gods about this sorrowful matter that had befallen him like night rain, there was nothing to be done. He went down to the shore, followed the sacred path, and when he told his young wife what had happened, his dew-like existence seemed ready to vanish, not knowing even where to place himself, with no trace left by the waves.

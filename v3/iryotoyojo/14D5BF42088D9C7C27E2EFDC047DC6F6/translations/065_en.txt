Even the sage left behind his parents' country because, though the state of Lu was vast, there seemed to be no kindred spirit there. Also, when he met Master Cheng and tilted his hat, talking so long on the road that his legs went numb, it was because their hearts connected from their very first meeting. When hearts do not harmonize, even parents and children, brothers become like bitter enemies; when hearts do harmonize, all within the four seas become like brothers and young companions. These are words born from experiencing both the bitter and the sweet.

Therefore, since Rokō is now the most acclaimed of all, who would not desire him? Everyone says he has fine looks, and many are moved in heart just by seeing the patterns on his cotton garments. Yet why is it that not a single person has succeeded in winning him?

But this man, through a chance encounter, managed to win him in such a manner - truly he could be called the tutelary deity of this way. Before long the two rose up and did something - perhaps ablutions - in a most refined manner. When they returned to their original seats and exchanged cups of sake, somehow they appeared much more relaxed than at the beginning.

The moon gradually rose higher, the boat's interior became bright as day, and the river breeze blew gently across, giving the feeling that summer had departed and autumn had arrived - a most enchanting scene. Then that man gazed intently at Rokō's face, at first appearing melancholy, but his uncontainable feelings showed outwardly, and tears began to flow in streams.

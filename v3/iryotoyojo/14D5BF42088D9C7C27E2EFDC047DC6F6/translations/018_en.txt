it cannot be called the wisdom of a great king. If this is truly your earnest desire, then let us send an envoy to capture and bring him here. What problem could there be? What do you all think?" When he said this, all the assembled people spoke in unison that "King Byōdō's deliberation is extremely reasonable," and even the previously stubborn great king acknowledged it as "quite right."

King Taizan said: "Generally speaking, people are not born to come to this land unless it is their predetermined karma. Come now, we should examine the book of predetermined karma." He had it brought out and, reading it thoroughly over and over, said: "It says that Sanogawa Ichimatsu should die in the frost month of the Horse year, and Nakamura Sukegōrō should die of a tumor in the seventh month of the Sheep year, but Kikunojō's life has not yet reached the time when it should end. Even if you send an envoy, in that country there are Ise Hachiman and others, including his tutelary deity, the Inari of Ōji - troublesome old men who don't eat four or five [meals a day] and look down directly upon even this realm, protecting him in great numbers. It would be quite difficult for an official envoy to succeed. What should be done about this matter?" When he said this, King Shokō stepped forward and said: "That should be an easy matter. If we commission Tarōbō of Mount Atago, Jirōbō of Mount Hira and such, they would immediately seize and bring him here.

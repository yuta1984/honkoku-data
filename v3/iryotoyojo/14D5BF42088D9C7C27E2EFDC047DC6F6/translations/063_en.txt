Using the boat's rudder as a pillow, they would share a night of intimacy, and if they could reveal the deep feelings of Arisoumi to each other, the desires of this world would be fulfilled. So saying, he takes Rokō's hand and draws close. Though possessing refined elegance, the feelings from the other side are also very deep, and I too think "this person and no other," with such heavy feelings that words fail. Taking up the sake flask and offering a cup, the man courteously accepts it, drains it completely, and passes it to Rokō. Drinking and passing, passing and drinking in turn, unable to restrain themselves, being only two people, their numerous encounters must be the work of the god of unions. Night has already reached the fifth hour (around 8-9 PM), and intimately becoming like clouds and dragons, with the moon-lit crow as witness to their hearts, their mutual pledge is not shallow. Neither quite awake nor quite asleep, their obi loosened, they whisper together on their shared pillows. What dreams they saw - who can say?

I name this "Konnan Shigusa" (Root South Gesture). Though it cannot be compared to Shakyamuni's dove eggs, the ravings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, or Murasaki Shikibu's countless lies, when it comes to discussing human nature, both theirs and mine are but momentary expressions.

Root South Gesture, Volume One
"My lord, do not cross the river. My lord finally crosses the river, falls into the river and dies. What is to be done about my lord?"
This was composed as a poem expressing the lament of a wife in ancient China who could not bear the grief of her husband drowning and dying. Similarly, around the sixth month of Hōreki 13, an actor named Ogino Yaegiri is said to have entered the water and died, which became the talk of the town, but no one knows the definite facts. When I investigate the origin of this, it was not like Qu Yuan, who in his anger at having his pure whiteness stained by worldly dust, sank into the Miluo River, nor was it like someone diving to the ocean floor to retrieve jewels from the dragon palace

It seems as though people have emptied their homes from all provinces to come here, and the dust and dirt filling the air gives one the feeling that even the world's clouds originate from this place. As the common saying goes, "From morning till evening, three lines of spears never cease on Ryōgoku Bridge" - this appears to be the usual state of affairs. From midsummer to early autumn, when evening cooling is at its peak, the crowd is so dense that five or even ten lines of spears never break. The famous evening cooling at Shijō Riverbank in Kyoto pales in comparison - it's merely of such scale that even apprentices with slicked hair could be taken there. Even amidst such commotion, because there is something called love, mansion servants become entranced by female entertainers and forget their curfew, or push through crowds toward an attractive figure from behind, only to be startled by an unexpectedly plain face. When praising the beauty of a woman who has passed ahead, the women following behind, thinking the compliment refers to them, smile sweetly - how amusing! The skillful work of Tamaya shooting from tubes, Kagiya's ingenious devices that unlock the locks of dark nights. No sooner is "Look, fireworks!" called out than shooting stars appear, and spectators create an avalanche of people from the opposite riverbank to the bridge, causing an uproar. Even in the middle of the river, voices of food vendors call out - dengaku, sake, refined sake. The drool of Ruyang, Li Bai's vomit, Liu Bolin tapping the bottom of his purse, and orangutans spitting out heated stones. Tea boats, flat boats, boar-tusk boats, roofed boats, and pleasure barges.

This was also good entertainment. After rowing around here and there all day, they decided to leave the noisy places and enjoy themselves, rowing their boat to a place called Mitsumata and looking out over the scenery in all directions. To the south, the blue sea stretched endlessly, and the colors of clouds and sea could not be clearly distinguished; the passing sails were like fluttering butterflies, and what appeared along the seas of Awa and Sagami looked as if drawn with a single brushstroke. To the west, Hakone, Mount Ōyama and others could be seen faintly in the distance. Since today was that day in the sixth month, Mount Fuji's high peak, about which someone once composed "if it doesn't disappear at the full moon, then it snowed that night," could be seen very clearly. In the nearby area there were many human dwellings, with evening smoke from people's hearths drifting across. Even the vast Musashino plain had no uninhabited places, and instead of the old poetic image of "emerging from grass and entering grass" under the ancient moon, one could now say "emerging from eaves and entering eaves." The people walking along the roads looked like nothing more than ants going back and forth, giving one the feeling of having entered a fairy realm. Unconsciously striking the gunwale and singing very quietly, while people who might be described as "dust from boat houses scattering, and clouds drifting through the sky" were caught up in the mood, taking out incense packets and burning a single stick, enjoying themselves very quietly. "Come, let's go to the area around Nakasu and catch some corbicula clams," they said, and everyone transferred to small boats. Kikunojō said, "I have a hokku verse I've been thinking about, so I'll come later."

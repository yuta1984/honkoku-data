They created various new hells and called them "unlicensed brothel hells." Since the old woman of the Sanzu River could not possibly handle everything alone, they pardoned the sins of evil old women who had long fallen into hell—the old woman of the lone house in Asakusa, the Black Mound Hag of Adachigahara, the Bamboo Shoot Hag of Sakai-cho, and other wicked old women who in the mortal world had tormented daughters-in-law and hated stepchildren. These were brought in to assist the old woman of the Sanzu River, and as hell gradually expanded, those speculators submitted petitions once again, wishing somehow to become landlords of the new hell districts. However, since the cleaning fees for the hungry ghost realm were not profitable, they petitioned to have the seasonal fees set at two hundred mon each. Whether it be the bidding for tongue-pulling scissors, iron rods, the contracting of fire carts, or cauldrons—rather than having new ones specially ordered, they would collect broken-bottomed ones from the old hells and have them re-cast, dig bamboo roots, and purchase lamp wicks made from candlemaker's scraps at extremely low prices. Since even small matters in hell involve periods of a million kalpas or more, and dust accumulates over time, the speculators' schemes, or if the old clothes business of the Sanzu River were entrusted to one person, in exchange the prison guards would be allowed to gamble at dice, and even if tiger-skin loincloths were pawned, they would serve at quite reasonable rates. At such times, this would surely contribute to the prosperity of all the hells.

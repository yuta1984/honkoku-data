Volume Four of Nenashigusa

"The flow of the river never ceases, yet it is not the same water"—so wrote Kamo no Chōmei in his literary musings, remaining in the depths of the inkstone sea. The flow of the Sumida River is pure, and because it forms the boundary between Musashi and Shimōsa provinces, Ryōgoku Bridge is also famous. In contrast to the capital bird to whom the poet sang "Come, let me ask you of things," the passing boats go their way like autumn leaves scattering and floating, and lying low in the waves of the long bridge resembles a dragon taking its afternoon nap. Nearby, when the drums of acrobats resound to the clouds, even thunder flees clutching its belly. The high pile of sōmen noodles, copying the calligraphy practice leaves of falling snow, appears like Mount Fuji of the land of little people.

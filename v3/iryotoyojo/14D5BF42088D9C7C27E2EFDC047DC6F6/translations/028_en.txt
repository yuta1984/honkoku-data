When the promised time arrived, the entrance gate was bustling with such crowds that there was no ground space to drive in a nail. Truly, since the opening of heaven and earth, there had never been such a grand production. People both knowledgeable and ignorant, old and young, all thinking themselves important, gathered in throngs. The ceremonial sanbaso performance ended, and the customary opening speech concluded, so now the actual content of the kyōgen play "Ama-no-Ukihashi Sakahoko Nikki" (Chronicle of the Heavenly Floating Bridge and Sacred Spear) began in earnest from the first act, progressing through the acts.

"Futotama-sama!" from both the box seats and the pit, their voices continuing for some time without ceasing. At this moment, Amaterasu-Ōmikami heard this, found the performance delightful, and unable to resist, used her divine hands to open the rock cave door just a crack to peer at this scene. Seeing this as the perfect opportunity, the three deities approached and put their hands on the rock door to open it, while the Great Goddess tried to close it. As they pulled against each other with cries of "heave-ho," the contest remained completely unresolved. Just then, from the curtain at the back came the call "Wait, wait!"

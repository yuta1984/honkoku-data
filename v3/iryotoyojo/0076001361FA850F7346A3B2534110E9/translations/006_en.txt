In cases where double sounds like "u・kou・seu・syau" etc. are phonetically similar,
there are instances where the two sounds become confused. In such cases, if one cannot find it under one reading,
one should search under both pronunciations. Also, winter melon (tougan), also called kamouri; daikon radish,
also called karamono; ginger (shouga), also called hajikami - there are
many such cases. These should also be searched under both the formal and colloquial names. Other cases can be inferred
from these examples.

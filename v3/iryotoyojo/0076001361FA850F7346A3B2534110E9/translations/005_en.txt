Preface to the Mirror of Daily Nourishing Foods

This book records in detail the efficacy, toxicity, and dietary restrictions of daily foods and drinks using hiragana script. Food names are organized in iroha order with each initial character listed to make searching convenient. By keeping this booklet always at hand, one can avoid the trouble of consulting a doctor and naturally gain clear knowledge of the beneficial and harmful properties of foods and drinks.

The entire book is written in hiragana script, not avoiding vulgar language but primarily focusing on making it easily understandable to common people. For example, where one should write "kinki" (prohibition), it writes "sashiai" (conflict), and also "myou," "miyau," "ko"...

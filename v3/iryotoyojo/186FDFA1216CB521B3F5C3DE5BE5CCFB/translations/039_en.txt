Rootless Grass, Second Part, Volume 3

It is thus that I, Raizo of Ichikawa, speak. I had been suffering from a prolonged illness, and despite exhausting all medical treatments, I experienced no recovery whatsoever. However, recently I have been praying to the Kannon of Asakusa, and perhaps through that divine blessing, I began to feel remarkably better than usual. Therefore, I wish to make a pilgrimage to Asakusa in gratitude.

Like the fleeting dreams of this floating world in a short night, with the moon still obscured by lingering clouds, I spurred on the horse of my heart and arrived at the Enma Hall in front of Kuramae for the sake of the Buddhist Law. Since Asakusa is still quite far, I thought to rest here for a while, so I crouched down beside the hall and began to work my prayer beads for a moment.

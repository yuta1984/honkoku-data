Listen to those words while memorizing them. Especially when hearing each item one by one,
close your eyes without generating distracting thoughts, make the chest area
clear and bright, and keep it peaceful and quiet. This is called
"awakened mind" (kakushin). Until you finish creating analogies between that location (body part) and that item,
you must not listen to the next item. Sometimes there may be locations where you
cannot devise any analogy at all. However, if you contemplate thoroughly,
a connection for the analogy will eventually emerge. At that time,
you should listen to the next item. No matter how many items there are, continue this way until the end.

The first location is the crown of the head. Once you establish a connection for that item with this location
and have already entrusted it to the crown, the role of the first
location is complete. It is like putting something in a container,
locking it, and leaving it in trust. If you feel uncertain
and turn back to check in the middle, this is not good.
Generally, if you wish to memorize, it is essential to keep both eyes closed throughout
and lower your mind to the tanden (lower abdomen) for memorization.

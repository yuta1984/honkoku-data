use only two colors as markers. This is called "one object, two types."
Those two colors are the large mark and the small mark. For example, on the sea there are
many similar ships. On land, there are many similar
mounted horses. However, ships have ship marks, and horses have
horse marks. These are the large marks. Within those large marks,

banners and the like, for horses use reins, saddles, stirrups and the like—
any of these will do—distinguish them by one color. This is the small mark.

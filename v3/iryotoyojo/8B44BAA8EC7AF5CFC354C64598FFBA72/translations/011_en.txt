extending even to matters that should be diligently attained through breathing techniques, and further developing these through mutual deduction, I have composed this chapter. My humble hope is that through this work, one might awaken to the great way of nature and supplement even one ten-thousandth of the magnificent virtue of continuing enlightenment. This is merely the slight loyalty of one from the countryside, offering only the modest intention of献芹 (presenting humble offerings like wild vegetables to the emperor).

However, since using ornamental language in discourse can make it difficult to fully express one's intentions, I have recorded this as if showing it to ordinary people, deliberately avoiding literary embellishments. For this reason, I cannot refrain from immodest frank speech, and I only fear that the sin of not knowing my proper place - how could I possibly escape it?

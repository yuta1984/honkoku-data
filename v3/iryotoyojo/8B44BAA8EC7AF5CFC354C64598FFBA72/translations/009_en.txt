The disciple [of Kamiizumi Ise], Ogasawara Genshin, went to Great Ming China and taught the sword techniques of the Shinkage-ryu that he had established to the Chinese people. (The catalog of Shinkage-ryu is recorded in Ming's "Wubei Zhi.") Among his disciples, there was one who claimed to be a descendant of Zhang Liang and transmitted something called "the shadow measurement of the eight-inch halberd." Genshin learned this and added it to his swordsmanship, which was the beginning of the "brilliant movement" that Yoshinori advocates, and represents a glimpse of one aspect of the vast qi. When it came to Genshin's disciple Harigaya Sekiun, he practiced Zen meditation under Master Kohaku of Tofukuji Temple, discovered that there is a principle of victory within the function of inherent buddha-nature, and criticized worldly competition and rivalry, calling it "beast-like military strategy."

This was recorded by his disciple Otagiri Ichiun. (Sekiun's school was named "Mujushin Kenjutsu" [No-Abiding-Mind Swordsmanship] by Kohaku.) These practitioners like Sekiun and Ichiun considerably mastered the application of vast qi, and their approach is the same as Yoshinori's teaching, differing only in degrees of refinement and coarseness. This should be examined in the section describing the cultivation of qi in swordsmanship in the third volume.

One: The years of peace have been long, and human sentiment naturally flows toward superficiality and ostentation. While literary and martial studies are not entirely neglected, modern scholarship focuses exclusively on literary composition and rhetoric, treating the investigation of moral principles as a secondary concern.

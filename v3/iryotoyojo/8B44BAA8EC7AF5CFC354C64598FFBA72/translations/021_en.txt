Through the power of fire contained within it, this [qi] creates warmth in the bodies of sentient beings (living and active creatures). This principle cannot be fully explained in one brief discussion.

All people call this "breath" (iki) and term it "respiration" (kokyū). The reason why "life" (mei) is read as "inochi" is that it means "within the breath." The three characters qi (気), breath (息), and life (生) are all read as "iki," as recorded in examples.

The reason the nose forms first in human embryonic development is so that one can breathe this great qi and sustain life. This applies not only to humans but to all living beings, as can be seen in how a bird's beak first takes shape within the egg, then two black spots appear to become eyes, and something like scattered red threads becomes blood vessels, after which the complete form of the chick develops.

Now, this qi enters through the mouth and nose, penetrates to the center point between the legs at the body's core, circulates widely throughout the body, and thereby nourishes the entire frame. This area below the navel and between the legs is the pivot of the human body and the fundamental source where heavenly qi flows continuously without cease. In the language of India (Tianzhu), this breath is called "udāna," and is also termed "wind in the mouth." The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* also speaks of how the great qi of heaven enters through a person's mouth and nose and reaches below the navel.

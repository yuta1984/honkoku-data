The Mahā-śamatha-vipaśyanā states: "If one stops the mind in the dantian, then the breath-qi becomes harmonized. Therefore it can well heal diseases. The dantian is located two and a half inches below the navel." This also refers to making the center below the navel between the thighs the pivot of the entire body. For example, it is like a door having hinges, or a folding fan having a rivet. (Dantian is originally a vulgar term, but we temporarily follow what people easily understand. At this place of the dantian below the navel, the space between the eyebrows on the face, the tips of the feet, and the tip of a sword held in hand - at the place where they align with the center of the straight line where heavenly qi reaches to the earth's core - an enemy's striking sword can never penetrate. This matter has been discussed in detail in the section on swordsmanship in Volume Four.)

Mencius calls this the qi of "vast-flowing" (hao-ran). Hao means broad, or great, or abundant like water, referring to water that is wide and deep and greatly overflowing. Therefore hao-ran is annotated as the form of grand flowing, compared to a great river's flow without stagnation or obstruction, meaning it fills the space between heaven and earth with nothing left unpenetrated.

This is precisely what humans receive from the combination of the two qi of heaven and earth, yin and yang - what the I Ching calls "Supreme indeed is the Kun principle! All things receive life from it, and it obediently serves Heaven." Its virtue is described as "embracing and magnanimous, brilliant and great; all species and things achieve fulfillment." "Embracing" means encompassing, "magnanimous" means abundant, "brilliant and great" means clearly and broadly allowing the myriad species and various things to fulfill their natures through "universal achievement" - this is the great qi. All things between heaven and earth are without exception encompassed within this qi. Therefore

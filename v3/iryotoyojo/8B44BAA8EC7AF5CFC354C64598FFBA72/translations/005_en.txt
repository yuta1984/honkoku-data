Treatise on Cultivating Qi
　　　　　　　　General Summary

1. This book takes as its main purpose the explanation of the technique for cultivating what Mencius called "vast-flowing qi (haoran no ki)." However, because matters and theories are intermixed, and the arguments extend across extremely diverse topics, unless one repeatedly cross-references the entire work from beginning to end and studies it thoroughly, it will likely be difficult to understand its meaning in many places. This is entirely because it emerged from a hasty compilation by one unskilled in literary composition, written as thoughts came to mind, and has not reached the point where a single thread of literary coherence and logical flow runs throughout.

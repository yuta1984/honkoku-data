What humans receive from Heaven—filial piety, fraternal respect, loyalty, trustworthiness, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, as well as the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hatred, and desire—are all contained and stored within this qi without exception. Therefore, this is called the Way from which one "cannot depart even for a moment."

Zhou Maoshu said: "From the Great Void comes the name of Heaven. From qi transformation comes the name of the Way. Combining emptiness and qi gives the name of nature. Combining nature and consciousness gives the name of mind." The meaning of this passage is that humans are born from the qi transformation of Heaven and Earth, and what develops consciousness (the mind that knows and distinguishes) from each individual's nature (inborn character) that has received the qi of Heaven and Earth is called the mind. This explains the fundamental source. Humans existing within the great qi is like floating many baskets on the waves of the great ocean. Just as the inside and outside of the baskets are all water, so too our human bodies have no distinction between inside and outside—they are equal. It is like giving names to that equal water in the baskets, calling them lord, minister, father, and child. This matter has been discussed in detail in the *Essential Points of Nourishing Life*. Also, in the chapter of volume two that discusses the righteousness of lord and minister, I have explained this principle. It is also like tying up a piece of cloth with thread and assigning it the ranks of scholar, farmer, artisan, and merchant—when the bindings are untied, it is just one strip of cloth. When Mencius said, "Those who fully realize their mind know their nature. When they know their nature, they know Heaven," he was also explaining this principle of the unity of Heaven and humanity.

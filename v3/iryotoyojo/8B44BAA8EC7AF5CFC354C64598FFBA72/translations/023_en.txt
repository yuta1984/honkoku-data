All that humans receive from Heaven - filial piety, fraternal respect, loyalty, trustworthiness, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, as well as the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hatred, and desire - are all contained and stored within this [qi]. Therefore this is called the Way from which one cannot be separated even for a moment.

Zhou Maoshu said: "From the Great Void comes the name of Heaven; from qi transformation comes the name of the Way; combining the Void and qi gives the name of nature; combining nature and perception gives the name of mind." The meaning of this passage is that Heaven and Earth's qi transformation gives birth to humans, and what develops perception from each individual's nature that has received Heaven and Earth's qi is called the mind. This explains the fundamental source. Humans existing within the great qi is like floating many baskets on the waves of a great ocean.

The inside and outside of the baskets are all water, just as there is no difference between the inside and outside of our human bodies - they are equal. It is like giving names such as ruler and minister, father and son to the water in those equal baskets. (This matter has been discussed in detail in the "Essential Summary of Nourishing Life." Also, in the chapter discussing the righteousness of ruler and minister in Volume Two, this principle has been explained.) It is also like a piece of cloth tied with thread to which we assign the class distinctions of scholar, farmer, artisan, and merchant - when the ties are untied, it is just one piece of cloth. When Mencius said, "Those who fully realize their mind know their nature. When they know their nature, they know Heaven," he was also explaining this principle of the unity between Heaven and humanity.

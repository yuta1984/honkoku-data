The spleen and stomach should be tonified.

○When there is an urge for both bowel movements and urination, one should not hold back but relieve oneself immediately. If one holds back, hemorrhoids will develop. When bowel movements are constipated and blocked, one should always take medicine that moistens the body and lubricates the intestines and stomach. Cannabis seeds burned to charcoal and made into pills can be used effectively. This is a gentle and reliable method for promoting bowel movements. For urination, one should sit when hungry and stand when full. If one holds back and urination is delayed, it will cause swelling diseases or gonorrhea.

○An old saying goes, "When one falls ill, rather than not treating it, one should always consult a moderate physician." The way of health preservation should always be practiced.

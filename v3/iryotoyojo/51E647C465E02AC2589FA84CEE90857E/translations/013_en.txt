It is pushing out from within. First-time mothers should well understand this principle. Of course, at that time one should follow the midwife's instructions. Furthermore, during labor the husband should also stay in the same room to provide care, or even if not in the same room, should not go out, and should handle all matters with compassion. This gives the laboring woman great confidence and is the foundation of safe delivery. From during pregnancy, one should be careful about dietary health practices, keep the body light and work busily, not take afternoon or morning naps, and avoid overeating. Do not exhaust the mind, be careful in all things, and when preparation and attitude are good from beforehand, there is no worry of difficult labor. To make a commotion after difficult labor has already begun is extremely foolish.

Even if the birth itself may be easy, when prior care and preparation have been poor, there can be sudden emergencies so severe that there is no time to take countermeasures and even neighboring doctors cannot arrive in time. This should be guarded against and feared. When the child is born, the child's upbringing should also be attended to. Regarding post-birth care: cold foods, spicy foods, oily foods, hard foods, tough foods, and raw foods should not be consumed. Sexual relations should be forbidden for one hundred days. When restraint is poor, it leads to fatigue, or becomes eye disease, or what is called "blood pathway" disorders with headaches and chills, causing various illnesses to arise. Strict restraint after birth is of primary importance.

○The "Collected Writings on Longevity and Nourishment" states: Common people should once daily stroke and press with their hands from the Baihui acupoint on the head to all four sides of the head, the eyebrows, the sides of the nose bridge, and the inside and outside of the ears. Next, massage the left and right sides of the neck, tap and press the back, and also thoroughly massage and stroke the joints of the hands and feet. One should perform this on oneself. Finally, grasp the toes with one hand and bend them, while using the other hand to scratch and stroke the Yongquan acupoint on the sole of the foot. This will cause qi to descend and wonderfully cure diseases of the legs.

○Regarding bathing in the "Thousand Gold Prescriptions," it states to bathe once every ten days and wash the hair once every five days, but this is difficult to trust in Japan. One should follow the circumstances of the time.

○Hot spring therapy is suitable for the following conditions: wounds, bruises, falls from horses, scabies, and various swellings that are difficult to heal over long periods. Unsuitable symptoms include: internal conditions, consumptive disorders, kidney deficiency, sweating disorders, qi deficiency, and heat conditions - all are unsuitable. However, for symptoms of qi stagnation, food stagnation, loss of appetite, and deficiency-cold conditions due to disordered qi and blood, warming may sometimes be beneficial, though not with the immediate effectiveness seen in external conditions. Long-term bathing is good. Regarding prohibitions during hot spring therapy: First, sexual activity, heavy drinking, overeating, and foods of hot nature must not be consumed. These should be avoided even after the hot spring treatment. Moxibustion therapy should also be avoided. About ten days later, tonic medicines should be taken. Eat small amounts of fish and birds of good nature.

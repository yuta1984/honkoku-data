Even if the illness is severe, if one maintains good health practices for a long time, unexpected recovery may occur. If you truly feel that recovery is uncertain even for yourself, you should prepare your resolve and make a will and such. When resolve is determined, true peace of mind is established. Through this, even those with serious illness sometimes achieve unexpected full recovery. This should be kept in mind. Fatal symptoms are certainly determined by heaven's decree. Worrying is of no avail. Tormenting one's heart is the height of foolishness.

○Regarding the desire for sleep, nighttime rest should be limited to the third watch. The third watch is from around 10 PM to 2 AM. Going to sleep during the third watch and rising at dawn is best. Those who constantly favor daytime naps and prefer sleeping after meals develop illness and have short lives. This is because food does not digest properly. Even when sleeping at night, one should wait a short while before lying down. When lying down at night, lie on your side with knees bent and waist curved, gather qi in the qihai point, breathe in through the nose and exhale from mouth to nose, and lie in this manner. Every time you wake up, you should change position. If you wake around dawn, even if sleepy, you should not go back to sleep. This is restraining and moderating the desire for sleep. Do not indulge in sleep at will. Reading books and conversing with people at night should also be limited to the third watch. If one does not sleep until late night, the spirit becomes worn down, which is not good. Especially for hosts, guests, and servants

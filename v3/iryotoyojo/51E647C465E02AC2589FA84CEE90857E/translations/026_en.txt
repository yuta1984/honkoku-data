qi becomes bound. It is also said that all diseases arise from qi. One should always be mindful of nourishing qi.

○The "Caring for Parents in Old Age" states there are seven methods of nourishment: Speak little to nourish internal qi. Abstain from sexual desires to nourish essence qi. Make rich flavors light to nourish blood qi. Drink bodily fluids to nourish organ qi. Suppress anger to nourish liver qi. Moderate food and drink to nourish stomach qi. Reduce contemplation to nourish heart qi. This is the way to preserve longevity. In all matters, one should practice moderation and cultivate health.

○Master Sun says there are five beneficial practices in the way of self-cultivation: It is good to frequently comb the hair. It is good to constantly place hands on the face. It is good to frequently tap the teeth. It is good to constantly swallow saliva. It is good to constantly practice qi. "Practice" means to calm. "It is good to place hands on the face" means to constantly stroke and massage the face. There is a method for this stroking. Rub the palms together vigorously with force, and when the inside of the hands becomes hot, first place them on the eyes to warm them repeatedly, then immediately stroke and massage the face. When practicing this two or three times daily, even though one's vision may be cloudy due to old age, it will become clear after some time passes - this is truly wondrous and marvelous.

A certain merchant
invited guests, but at an
unfortunate time he had
sent people here and there,
so there were few servants.
Until they returned, he had
the guests wear
octagonal spectacles,
and then just one servant
appeared to be eight people.
The master of this house
seemed more trustworthy
than he had heard,
and appeared to reconsider
his opinion that this was
a person who did
improper things.
The master also appeared
to be eight people, but
being dazzled by this woman's
beauty, he didn't notice
that the master appeared as eight,
and praised her as
a beautiful
attendant of the same kind.

Having eight people bring sake cups
to just three guests is quite amusing.

nothing to
give you.

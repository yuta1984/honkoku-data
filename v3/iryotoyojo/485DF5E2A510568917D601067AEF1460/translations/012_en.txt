Illiterate people could write letters at home, but they come to the Azumaya to write - this seems a bit pretentious.

If I write it like this, it should be mostly good.

When one frantically takes up the brush and puts on the spectacles, the characters naturally form based on what one thinks in their heart, what they see and hear. This too is a wondrous pair of spectacles.

Once, a country person wanted to send a letter to his home province, but being originally illiterate, he could not write. He put on these spectacles and wrote. His letter said:

"I trust you continue in good health without incident. To say for certain, does this mean it is auspicious? I thought so. Now then, regarding the matter of Shimohori this time, it has reached Edo, and I have opened a shop. I have all the capital needed, and I am extremely pleased. Therefore, I would like to borrow three pieces of gold until late July. I will not forget to repay you. Please understand this matter. I have respectfully read your letter. Sincerely, Hachibe."

There's nothing to worry about at all.
As for worrying, the midwife
says "doing is easier than worrying"
but worrying is truly
a bone-breaking affair.

Long ago there was a man called Kōuemon
who, to tell the truth, was originally from
Yamada in Ise, but due to some
error in his judgment
he was reduced to having nothing but
a single summer kimono
and came to Edo thinking
he'd try doing something.
He rented a single-bay
back-alley shop
in the Nishi-no-Kubo area of Shiba
and day and night
racked his brains thinking,
but indeed, other than
selling four-mon coins
for three mon, there was
no other scheme. "There must be
something," he consulted with his knees,
and discussed with his pillow and other things,
mortars and pestles,
but the mortar
and pestle
had nothing but
a "clatter-clatter"
greeting
and nothing else
to offer.

Because I've worried
too much, drowsiness
has come over me.
Shall I lie down for a bit?

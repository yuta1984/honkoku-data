One day,
"Today is
kinoe-ne (the first day of the sexagenary cycle)
so I shall go
to Daikokuten"
On the road to the Daikoku
shrine in Koishikawa,
while relieving
himself, he suddenly
spotted three mon
coins that had
fallen there.
"Is this something
that Heaven
has bestowed upon me,
or is it something
that Daikokuten
has granted me?"
Never once since birth
had he picked up even one mon...

Unlike mirror polishing,
this won't break your back.

Having never done so before, finding three mon now was
as joyful as a kite
from Mount Arigatai
about to take flight.
Finding the three-mon
coin,
he leisurely
returned home.
Using this as capital,
somehow his desperate
three-mon deliberation
became an investment,
and he started
the business of polishing eyeglass lenses.
Eyeglass polishing
is an interesting idea indeed.

This is a good idea—
it should
become popular!

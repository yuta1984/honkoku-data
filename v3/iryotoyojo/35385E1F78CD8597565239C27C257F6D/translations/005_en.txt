They know the great benevolence and are mindful not to lose the virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. Those of middle virtue, though not reaching the level of superior people, advance somewhat in their responses and think not to reach evil. As for people of inferior wisdom, they know nothing at all of the benevolence of heaven and earth, focusing solely on selfish intentions and being ignorant of moral principles. Therefore, they fall far short of even the way grass, trees, birds, and beasts nourish their lives. How can this not be lamentable?

Now, among all things born between heaven and earth, nothing is more noble and spiritual than human beings. Why is this so? Because the eyes distinguish what they see, the ears distinguish what they hear, the nose discriminates between fragrance and odor, the mouth knows taste, the hands create things, and the feet can travel a thousand li. The physical form equals heaven and earth, lacking nothing. Therefore, the human body is called a microcosm. Nothing between heaven and earth is more wondrous and mysterious than the human body. Because of this, regardless of high or low status...

○Therefore, the human body is called a microcosm

△The body of one person is the symbol of one country. The position of chest and abdomen is like a palace chamber, the arrangement of the four limbs is like outer territories, the spirit is like a ruler, blood is like ministers, and qi is like the people. Having joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure, likes and dislikes is like having yin-yang and light-dark.

If one is prudent with one's body, studies the teachings of sages, respects those above and shows kindness to those below, extends compassionate heart even to birds, beasts, fish and turtles, feels gratitude for the natural growth of all things in heaven and earth, does not focus on selfish intentions, puts honesty first, and maintains a lifespan of one hundred years—would this not be quite an easy thing?

The way of life cultivation is exactly the same as how heaven and earth nourish grass, trees, birds, beasts, fish and turtles. Therefore, from birth to old age, if one practices seasonal cultivation without excess or deficiency, being neither too warm nor too cold, neither taking nor blaming, respecting others and humbling oneself, advancing toward good and distancing from evil, and being prudent with one's body, then one becomes of the same mind as heaven and earth, and heavenly gods, earthly deities, buddhas and bodhisattvas cannot fail to respond. The evidence for this is too numerous to enumerate. The way of governing the country and bringing peace to the world—its foundation lies in protecting the body and cultivating one's nature; without this, one cannot practice filial piety and loyalty. This way should be pursued with single-minded devotion...

Baopuzi says: One person's body is the symbol of one country. The position of chest and abdomen is like palace chambers, the arrangement of the four limbs is like outer territories, the spirit is like a ruler, blood is like ministers, qi is like the people. If one knows how to govern the body, then one can govern a country. Loving one's people is the way to secure one's country; cherishing one's qi is the way to preserve one's body. When people scatter, the country perishes; when qi is exhausted, the body dies. Therefore, the sage eliminates troubles before they arise and treats diseases before they manifest.

The Book of Sui says: Heaven has yin-yang, wind and rain, darkness and light; humans have joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure, likes and dislikes. If these are moderated and practiced accordingly, then harmony and balance are achieved, etc.

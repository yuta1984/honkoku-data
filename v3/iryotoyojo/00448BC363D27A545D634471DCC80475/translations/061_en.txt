Essays by Elder Kan Chazan—
《Title: Idle Brush Strokes》　　　　　　　　Complete in Four Volumes
　Master Chazan, a virtuous elder renowned as a poetry sage,
　is known throughout the world. This book covers not only poetry and elegant literature
　but also, from the understanding that refined and mundane matters are not separate, 
　essential household matters such as avoiding and preventing poisoned wells and
　theft, proper discussions of classics and histories, and local strange tales and ghost stories—
　recording their truth, and the conduct of heroic and extraordinary people, among
　various other fine stories. Though numerous, they contain nothing frivolous and are meant to
　benefit the reader.

【Note: Qilao (耆老) = an elderly person of high virtue. Shi (蓍) is pronounced "Shi" and is the name of a plant.】

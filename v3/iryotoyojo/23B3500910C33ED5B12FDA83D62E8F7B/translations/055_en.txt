This is the case. In the past, those who praised alcohol told a story of three men named Wang Su, Zhang Heng, and Ma Jun who traveled through fog in the early morning. One drank alcohol, one was full from rice, and one was on an empty stomach. The one with an empty stomach died, the one who had eaten became ill, and the one who drank alcohol remained healthy. They say this shows that alcohol's ability to ward off evil qi surpasses that of other foods. Generally, both in the past and now, those who drink with pleasure do not speak of its great harms, but only cite such minor examples and consider them the merits of alcohol. This is truly pitiful and also laughable. These three men had not repeatedly experienced such situations to test this theory - it was just one occurrence, yet they make it into a fixed principle.

Should this be considered a rule? We cannot know the original age, strength or weakness, or presence or absence of illness in those three men. If a weak person was on an empty stomach, his death would also be natural. If a strong person drank alcohol, his health would also be natural. What would happen if their situations were reversed? Even if alcohol truly does ward off miasmic fog, evil qi, wind-cold, and external pathogens, should one remain constantly intoxicated day and night during mountain travel, riverside lodging, hot journeys, and cold roads?

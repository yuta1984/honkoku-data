Stone lin is caused by turbid yin fluids coagulating due to fire-heat in the bladder, which is like the phenomenon of boiling seawater to make salt. This is blood transforming into pus, and pus further transforming into stones. The difficulty urinating in qi lin is due to pus and blood blocking the urethral passage of the penis, making urination difficult. That lao lin occurs due to fatigue is not limited to this condition alone - many diseases are triggered by fatigue. This also induces blood lin symptoms, so it develops through labor. Therefore, there is fundamentally only one type of blood lin, and the other four types appear to be merely its symptoms. Generally, when corrupted blood enters the large intestine, it becomes visceral toxicity and bloody stools, and when it enters the small intestine or bladder, it becomes urinary disorders. This is because there cannot originally be pus or stones in a person's abdomen.

Generally, developing urinary disorders occurs mostly in obese people with abundant blood who drink large amounts of alcohol, while thin people with little blood who don't drink alcohol rarely suffer from this disease. If people who don't drink alcohol develop this condition, in middle age it would be due to long periods without sexual activity causing stagnant fire in the lower body that corrupts blood and causes this; in old age it would be due to excessive sexual activity causing yin deficiency and fire movement that corrupts blood and causes this. Sometimes elderly people or even those in middle age who engage in extremely excessive sexual activity may have their kidney essence depleted and pass blood. This is not urinary disorder but an extremely dangerous condition. This also occurs in those who drink alcohol excessively. Generally, if one thoroughly understands where diseases originate and exercises caution accordingly, none of these various diseases should occur.

Only by following this can one hope for the healing of illness. What the famous Bian Que called "six incurable conditions in illness" - the first incurable condition of "being arrogant and willful, not accepting reason" refers to being self-willed when facing illness and not understanding the principles of health preservation. "Despising the body and valuing wealth" as the second incurable condition refers to how miserly people dislike spending on the path of health preservation and are reluctant to part with money and treasures. "Clothing and food being inappropriate" as the third incurable condition refers to not having appropriate clothing in response to cold and heat, and also excess or deficiency in food, no distinction between day and night, or not observing taboos. "Vital qi of organs being unstable" as the fourth incurable condition refers to the five organs having five emotions, and these emotional energies like joy and anger being unstable. "Being weakened and unable to take medicine" as the fifth incurable condition refers to disliking and not using medicine even when the illness becomes severe.

"Trusting shamans and not trusting doctors" is the sixth incurable condition, which refers to performing prayers and purification rituals when facing illness and not using medical treatment. Indeed, such people will see light illnesses become severe, and severe illnesses will not be cured. These matters are not things that doctors should know, but rather things that ordinary people should constantly consider well, so noting them in detail here is also part of health preservation. What the "Shosei Hogen" discusses regarding "despising the body and valuing wealth" seems to greatly contradict Bian Que's original intent. It appears that Gong Tingxian may have completely misunderstood those words.

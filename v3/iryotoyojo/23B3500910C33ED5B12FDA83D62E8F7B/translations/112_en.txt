Although various phlegm conditions are always present, they rarely cause great harm. Those who develop phlegm from cold-heat or wind-dampness will see their phlegm also heal when the pathogenic qi departs. Also, those who develop phlegm due to qi, stagnation, or deficiency do so because they have underlying pathological conditions that then produce phlegm—phlegm is not the root disease.

However, alcohol phlegm symptoms are consistently very common. Since this is caused solely by alcohol, when alcohol is not consumed excessively, this condition will not occur. How does alcohol produce phlegm? Generally, although there are various types of phlegm conditions, they occur when damp-heat steams and transforms body fluids into phlegm. Now, although damp-heat can injure both exterior and interior in various ways,

Using this substance of extreme damp-heat to continuously steam the intestines, stomach, chest, and diaphragm day and night—how could it not produce phlegm? Ancient theories state that pure alcohol creates phlegm through damp-heat steaming and stagnation, and also that drinking water after alcohol causes stagnation in the spleen and stomach, producing phlegm. The Confucian School's "Caring for Parents" states that excessive drinking fills the intestines and stomach, preventing proper filtration and excretion, eventually becoming fluid retention. "Jade Mechanism Subtle Meanings" says there are those who acquire phlegm through alcohol consumption. "Renzai's Direct Pointing Prescriptions" states that alcohol users develop painful, heavy, and numb arms and hands due to phlegm. Wang Jiezhai says that chronic phlegm is generally from drinking

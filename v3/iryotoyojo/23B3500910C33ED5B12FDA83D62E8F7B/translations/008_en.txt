Preface to the Discourse on Sake and Life Cultivation
One day, my friend Sōshū-shi brought the "Discourse on Sake and Life Cultivation" and showed it to me, saying: "This book has been stored in my house for a long time. Its discourse contains quite a bit worth observing. Now I have pruned its redundancies, corrected its errors, and made a clean copy of it to serve as my own admonition. I hope you will resolve its doubtful points and determine its merits and demerits, so that it may be transmitted." I obtained it and read it.

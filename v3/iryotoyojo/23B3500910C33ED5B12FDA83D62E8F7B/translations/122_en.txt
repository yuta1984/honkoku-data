○Stomach reflux (hongui) is a disease where food is expelled from within the stomach. There are also symptoms of vomiting and dry retching. In ancient discussions, stomach reflux and vomiting are sometimes discussed separately, but their underlying causes are generally not different. It seems these should not be discussed as separate conditions. However, stomach reflux involves food that enters the stomach and comes out after a long time, and its symptoms appear severe. Vomiting involves food that comes out immediately, and its symptoms appear mild. "Ou" (retching) involves sound when food comes out, while "to" (vomiting) involves food coming out without sound. Even in stomach reflux symptoms, when food comes out, it cannot be separated from these two types. Therefore, there is no need to deliberately separate stomach reflux and vomiting. Dry retching refers to having only the sound of vomiting while food does

not come out. Also, since ancient times, stomach reflux and esophageal obstruction (itsukaku) have sometimes been discussed together, but this is also inappropriate. Stomach reflux involves expelling food that has entered, while esophageal obstruction involves choking and blockage that prevents food from entering from the beginning. Since the causes of disease are also not the same, they should not be discussed together. Although there are various causes for the occurrence of stomach reflux and vomiting symptoms, they are primarily due to alcohol. The Inner Classic states: "Alcohol is the essence of water and grain, the liquid of cooked grain. Its qi is violent and rapid, and when it enters the stomach, the stomach swells and reverses upward, filling the chest." In the Records of the Grand Historian, a famous physician named Chunyu Yi diagnosed a person named Zhao Zhang and said: "This is penetrating wind. When food and drink go down the throat, they immediately come out and do not remain. This disease was acquired from alcohol."

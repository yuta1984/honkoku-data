He normally maintained the five precepts well without violation, but one time when his throat was parched, he drank what was in a vessel thinking it was water when it was actually alcohol, thus first violating the precept against drinking. In his drunken confusion, when a chicken flew over from next door, he stole and killed it to eat, thus violating two precepts: against killing and stealing. Also, when the neighbor woman came looking for her chicken, he forced himself upon her, violating the precept against adultery. When the neighbor household reported this to the authorities, he lied saying "I did not do such things," thus violating the precept against false speech. In this way, all five precepts were violated because of alcohol.

Also, the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom lists thirty-five faults of alcohol, including first that it wastes wealth, and second that it causes many illnesses. An ancient poet wrote: "Mostly due to alcohol's nature the heart of desire for women stirs; naturally becoming lost in women, alcohol's nature becomes crooked. After drinking, looking at women brings no satisfaction; before women, drinking wine brings limitless excitement." This "flower" refers to sexual matters. Sex and alcohol mutually serve as each other's root, together encouraging one another. Even the excess of one matter is problematic, how much more so the excess of both matters. Therefore, since the harm of sexual desire mostly comes from alcohol, making the restraint of alcohol excess the first priority is paramount.

Even with other various accumulations and gatherings, what forms their shape is mostly stagnant blood. Generally, in the human abdomen, aside from the organs, fat membranes, and muscle vessels, what else could form shapes? Blood alone exists everywhere in the body, limbs, and all parts. If qi does not circulate it, it stagnates and becomes disease. Therefore, when blood in the abdomen and intestines becomes corrupted, it all becomes accumulations and gatherings. However, since blood is originally inherent to the human body, even when it stagnates and forms masses, it does not immediately cause harm, but develops over many years. Generally, when people vomit blood or have bloody stools due to various circumstances, or when women have bleeding during menstruation, childbirth, etc., they necessarily pass blood clots with form, like the liver and intestines of birds and beasts.

things are passed. Therefore, one should understand that when blood coagulates and stagnates, it necessarily can form shapes. Since alcohol is what most severely corrupts blood, it is not strange that heavy drinkers develop masses due to this. Generally, while masses may seem to cause no particular harm at the time, if left untreated for long periods, they eventually become serious diseases. When they are not yet severe, one should abstain from alcohol and take medicine to treat them well. Generally, those who drink heavily and become very fat develop stroke; those who become very thin develop obstruction syndrome; those who neither gain nor lose weight have vomiting blood and bloody stools; those who do not lose blood suffer heart pain and abdominal pain; and when stagnation continues long, they develop symptoms such as accumulations, gatherings, and distension. These are all alcohol diseases.

There are very many physicians who discuss diseases caused by alcohol. This will be frequently mentioned throughout this text.

The Baopuzi states: "Alcoholic beverages, while pleasant in taste, are toxic substances that generate disease, having no slight benefit but causing mountainous harm. The gentleman ruins his virtue through this, while the petty person invites crime through this. Those who indulge in and are deluded by this rarely escape calamity. Moreover, all great and small disorders stem from alcohol. Nevertheless, common people enjoy this and become intoxicated by it, instantly arousing numerous ailments and binding various diseases deep within the body."

Zhu Danxi describes several symptoms of diseases caused specifically by alcohol. In the beginning, the illness is mild - perhaps vomiting, spontaneous sweating, sores, nasal conditions, diarrhea, or heart-spleen pain - which can be treated through dispersing methods.

If it continues for a long time, the disease becomes serious. It becomes wasting-thirst disease, internal abscess, lung atrophy, internal hemorrhoids, drum distention, blindness, wheezing, consumptive cough, and epilepsy, also becoming diseases difficult to clarify. Without proper discernment, treatment is not easy.

According to Li Shizhen's theory: "When drinking heavily, it injures the spirit, depletes the blood, damages the stomach, destroys the essence, generates phlegm, and stirs up fire."

Generally, diseases caused by alcohol are severe and difficult to treat. Among heavy drinkers, nine out of ten people develop illness. Among those who develop illness, eight out of nine cannot be cured. Even those said to recover, while not immediately fatal, mostly become people with chronic diseases or disabilities, unable to be useful in society.

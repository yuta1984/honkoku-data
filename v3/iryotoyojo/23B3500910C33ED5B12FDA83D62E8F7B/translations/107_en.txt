　　Discussion of Dysentery
○Dysentery is a disease that discharges pus and blood in the stool. Its symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, tenesmus and a feeling of incomplete evacuation. When one cannot eat, it is called "mouth-blocking dysentery," and when many people generally become ill, it is called "epidemic dysentery." There are also symptoms such as childhood malnutrition dysentery. This condition occurs frequently only at the transition between summer and autumn. Since ancient times, this condition has been discussed as damp-heat, with the spleen and stomach being unregulated and injured by food and drink. When heat injures the blood aspect, it becomes red dysentery; when heat injures the qi aspect, it becomes white dysentery. Red belongs to heat and white belongs to cold, so it is said.

what is discussed is generally like this. Looking at this now, there are cases that do not necessarily match what is theorized. How so? While there is logic in saying that the symptoms are damp-heat with unregulated spleen and stomach, what the red and white substances discharged in this condition actually are is not clear. If this is considered to be the accumulation and stagnation of food and drink, would what is discharged be the putrefaction of food? If one has diarrhea from being injured by food, this would be the diarrhea syndrome discussed earlier. What is discharged in dysentery is not the putrefaction of food. Moreover, there are cases where many people generally become ill. Generally, among human foods, some people eat fine foods like rich meat and grain, while others eat poor foods like goosefoot and beans.

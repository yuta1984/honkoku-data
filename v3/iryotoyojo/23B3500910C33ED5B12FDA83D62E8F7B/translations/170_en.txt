would not be necessary either. Use the medicine, and after that, come inform me again," and he returned. Immediately when that medicine was used, this courtesan heard about the moxibustion treatment and was greatly surprised and frightened, properly took this medicine and made sounds, gradually moved, gradually got up, and was instantly cured. It was truly a feigned illness. The next day, Jiebin asked his friend about the reason, and [the friend] said there was a matter of jealousy and thus such deception was carried out. Jealousy refers to women's jealousy, as seen in the "Wuzazu" (Five Assorted Offerings). Since such things exist in the world, those who practice medicine should pay careful attention.

　　On Cholera (Huo Luan)
○ Cholera refers to being affected externally by wind-cold and summer-heat dampness, and internally being harmed by food and drink, raw and cold foods, causing abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, with trembling and confusion - hence it is called cholera. When one cannot vomit or have diarrhea, it is called dry cholera, which is a dangerous condition. The "Treatise on Disease Origins" states: "Drinking alcohol, eating meat, excessively consuming raw fish and cold foods, sitting and lying on damp ground, being exposed to wind and seeking coolness cause this." The "Three Causes Prescriptions" says it is "caused by drinking alcohol recklessly." The "Life-Preserving Collection" says it is "caused by drinking alcohol beyond proper measure." The "Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium" says it is "caused by harm from alcohol and sex." If these various theories are correct, then this is primarily caused by alcohol.

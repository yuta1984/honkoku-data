is called heat disease, and throughout the four seasons this is called cold damage (shanghan). In addition to this, there are also symptoms of inner cold (zhonghan), wind damage (shangfeng), and others. There are also symptoms from being injured by spring wind, summer heat, and autumn dampness. Generally these are called seasonal epidemics (shiyi). Light symptoms from wind-cold injury are called common cold (ganmao). These are all disease symptoms from being struck by external pathogens. How do these cold damage and wind damage symptoms occur? The Inner Classic states: "The three months of winter are called closed storage. Water freezes and earth cracks. Do not disturb the yang qi. Sleep early and rise late, always wait for sunlight, avoid cold and seek warmth, and do not let qi leak from the skin." When one is careful about such cultivation and the body is robust and healthy, one will not be affected by external pathogens.

However, when the mind and body are overworked and the skin opens and leaks, if one encounters wind-cold at such times, one will certainly develop cold damage or wind damage illness. Generally speaking, while there are various ways to become internally exhausted and externally open the skin and leak qi, nothing is more severe than drinking large amounts of alcohol. Alcohol first causes depletion and damage to qi, blood, and the organ systems, making one easily susceptible to pathogenic qi. The Inner Classic says "pathogenic qi takes advantage of deficiency to enter." Also, when drinking heavily, even in cold weather the body generates heat. When heated, the skin necessarily leaks and the interstices open, allowing pathogenic qi to follow and enter. However, when drinking while still intoxicated, the qi of effusion is strong, so pathogenic qi cannot enter. It is like a city gate being open but with strict defending soldiers

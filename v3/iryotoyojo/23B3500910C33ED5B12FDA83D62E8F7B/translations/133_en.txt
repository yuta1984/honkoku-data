In severe cases, they develop various major diseases such as edema, distention, vomiting and diarrhea, and alternating chills and fever. The ancients spoke of
prenatal vital energy and postnatal vital energy. Prenatal vital energy refers to the vital energy that humans
receive from their parents at the beginning of life. This comes from receiving a portion of the parents' vital energy.
Postnatal vital energy refers to creating vital energy through food and drink. The Inner Classic states that humans die
after seven days without food or drink. Therefore, without food and drink,
this life cannot be maintained. Hence this is called postnatal vital energy. Without the prenatal, 
this life would not exist, and without the postnatal, this life cannot be maintained. Prenatal energy
resides between the kidneys and the gate of life, while postnatal energy resides between the spleen and stomach. This is because
food and drink enter the stomach and the spleen transforms them. The Classic states that the stomach is the sea of the five organs and six bowels.

All water and grain enter the stomach, and the five organs and six bowels all receive their energy from the stomach. The stomach is
the foundation of the five organs. Also, the Classic states that when grain is at peace, there is prosperity; when grain is cut off,
there is destruction. According to the famous physician Li Dongyuan, when the spleen and stomach are deficient, the five
organs and six bowels, twelve meridians, fifteen collaterals, four limbs and hundred bones all fail to receive nourishing energy, and
a hundred diseases arise. Therefore, nothing in the human body is more precious than the spleen and stomach.
Hence Sun Simiao said that nourishing the kidneys is not as good as nourishing the spleen.
Now, the spleen and stomach should be preserved and nourished in this way, yet
causing their deficiency and damage is truly fearsome. Generally, there are various ways
to damage the spleen and stomach, but the primary cause is through food and drink. Food and drink are originally meant to nourish the spleen and stomach,

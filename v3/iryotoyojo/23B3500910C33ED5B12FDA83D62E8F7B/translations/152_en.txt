Blood loss each has its own causes, but this is primarily and most often due to alcohol.
Why is this so? Because all blood loss occurs when blood is not stored properly and becomes disordered, flowing recklessly.
Nothing disrupts and disorders blood more severely than alcohol. The Inner Classic says "Those who drink alcohol have their defensive qi first go to the skin, and nutritive qi then becomes full." The Complete Works of Jingyue states: "Alcohol is the essence of water and grain, and blood is also the essence of water and grain. When alcohol enters the middle burner, it necessarily seeks its own kind and directly rushes to the blood aspect. Blood belongs to yin and has a gentle nature. Alcohol belongs to yang and has fierce qi. When alcohol enters the blood aspect, blood tries to remain calm but alcohol agitates it; blood tries to hide but alcohol pursues it. Therefore, when one drinks alcohol, both body and face become red. This is a sign of entering the blood and also a sign of dispersing blood."

Being thus, it is no wonder that alcohol causes blood loss. The Essential Prescriptions of the Golden Cabinet says: "Wine drinkers who cough will necessarily develop hematemesis. This is what extreme drinking and excess cause." The Treatise on Disease Origins states: "Hematemesis is all caused by great depletion and damage, as well as drinking alcohol causing exhaustion and damage. Also, among the three types of hematemesis, the symptoms of lung abscess involve vomiting after drinking when toxin fills up. After vomiting stops, there may again be one gō, two gō, or perhaps half a shō or one shō coming out." The Miraculous Effective Good Prescriptions says: "Drinking alcohol injures the stomach and eventually causes hematemesis." The Standards for Diagnosis and Treatment states: "Excessive drinking causes blood to flow recklessly, gushing out like a spring, with mouth and nose both flowing; if not rescued promptly, death follows immediately." Generally, bleeding from mouth and nose, bloody stools, and bloody urine occur frequently,

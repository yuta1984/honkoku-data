are said to cause this condition. Generally, while this symptom often has other causes as well, those who drink alcohol heavily frequently develop this condition. Since ancient times, this has been called "alcohol accumulation" (shuseki) or "alcohol addiction" (shuheki). This symptom is said to occur when drinking alcohol to excess causes it to bind and accumulate in the abdomen. This is a type of what is called "retained fluid" (ryuin). Sometimes heavy drinkers develop masses in the abdomen. Alcohol by nature is violent, fierce, and rapid. It circulates quickly without stagnating. The Inner Classic states: "When a person drinks alcohol, the alcohol also enters the stomach, but before the grain is digested, the urine alone comes out first." This refers to alcohol not remaining long in the body. Moreover, since the essence of alcohol is simply water, how could it form masses? Therefore, when alcohol

causes the formation of masses, what is this substance? It is simply stagnant corrupted blood. We have already discussed in the previous section how alcohol corrupts the blood. Alcohol corrupts the blood in the abdomen, and this corrupted blood eventually coagulates and stagnates, forming masses that become accumulations and gatherings. The Inner Classic discusses the formation of masses, saying "intestinal fluids and blood foam clash together and coagulate, unable to disperse, thus forming accumulations." Therefore, it is not only alcohol accumulations. Generally, most masses are caused by blood stasis. Even what is called "qi accumulation"—since qi originally has no form, how could it create the form of masses? When qi stagnates, blood also stagnates, and what forms the shape of masses is blood.

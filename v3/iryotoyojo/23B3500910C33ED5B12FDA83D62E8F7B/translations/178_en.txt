　　Discussion on Hemorrhoids and Fistulas

○Hemorrhoids and fistulas refer to sores forming at the anus with small flesh protruding. Those that do not ulcerate are called hemorrhoids, and those that ulcerate and discharge pus and blood are called fistulas. There are various symptoms, classified into five types, eight types, and twenty-four types, with names and conditions that are not uniform, but their causes are generally not different. External causes are said to be due to pathogenic qi of wind-dampness and dryness-heat, but most are caused by internal factors, namely diet. According to the Inner Classic, eating to satiation causes the sinews and vessels to become disordered, leading to intestinal disorders and hemorrhoids.

drinks excessively, causing swelling and pain each time alcohol is consumed, with bleeding. It also states that becoming drunk and full, then engaging in sexual activity or labor disturbs and agitates the qi and blood, causing this condition. In the Three Causes Prescriptions, the bleeding of the five hemorrhoids is alcohol hemorrhoids. The blood drips down from a separate opening near the anus, like a needle hole, and does not share the same passage as bowel movements. According to Zhu Danxi's theory, alcohol causes internal hemorrhoids, and hemorrhoids are easier to treat in people who do not drink alcohol. The Comprehensive Medical Records states that when people engage in sexual activity while drunk and full, vital essence leaks out, the pulse becomes empty and deficient, and alcohol-heat toxin flows and adheres to the vessels, or it results from extreme indulgence while drunk and full, forcibly restraining excretion. It also states that to cure hemorrhoids, one should abstain from alcohol and sex.

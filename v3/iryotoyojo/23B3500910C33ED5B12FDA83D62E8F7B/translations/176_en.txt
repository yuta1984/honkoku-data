○Urinary disorders (gonorrhea) refer to pain inside the penis with difficulty urinating, passing blood and discharging pus. According to ancient theories, there are five types of urinary disorders: qi lin (qi-type urinary disorder), shi lin (stone-type), xue lin (blood-type), gao lin (fatty-type), and lao lin (fatigue-type). All these urinary disorders are said to occur due to kidney deficiency causing heat in the bladder. It is also said that urinary disorders all belong to heat conditions. There are various other theories. Looking at this now, these symptoms are also largely caused by alcohol. The "Thousand Gold Prescriptions" states "These symptoms are caused by drinking alcohol, sexual exhaustion, and such." Sexual exhaustion refers to sexual desire. How does alcohol cause these symptoms? Generally, although urinary disorders have many types, they are simply caused by corrupted blood. The way alcohol corrupts blood is as described in the previous section. The "Treatise on the Origins of Disease"

states "Blood lin is a severe form of heat lin, where blood in urine is called blood lin." The "Standards for Diagnosis and Treatment" states "The heart governs blood, and qi connects to the small intestine. When heat is severe and strikes the blood vessels, blood receives heat and flows into the bladder, descending together with urine." This shows that urinary disorders are caused by blood. According to the theory of the five lin types: qi lin involves difficulty urinating with residual urine; shi lin involves pain in the penis and passing sand-like substances; gao lin involves passing oil-like substances in urine; lao lin occurs with fatigue; blood lin involves passing blood in urine. The so-called gao lin is also blood that has putrefied and become pus. Shi lin is pus that has further coagulated. In the "Investigation of Medical Prescriptions"

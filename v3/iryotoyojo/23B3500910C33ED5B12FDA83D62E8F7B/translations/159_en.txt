This can be said to exhaust the explanation. Sometimes women experience blood dizziness after childbirth and their heart blood becomes disturbed, or stagnant blood affects the heart, commonly causing this condition. Generally, epilepsy and madness are simply due to disturbance of heart blood, which clouds the spirit qi, creating various abnormal appearances that cause behavior different from normal. Now, I will not discuss other causes of this condition. However, those who develop this from alcohol are particularly numerous. How does alcohol cause this condition? The Inner Classic states: "When yang is entirely above and yin qi follows below, the lower becomes deficient and the upper becomes excess, thus causing the disease of manic epilepsy." Nothing surpasses alcohol in raising yang qi, creating lower deficiency and upper excess, stirring heart fire, and disturbing heart blood.

Those who drink heavily and become intoxicated behave the same as those with epilepsy and madness. People in the world think of drunken madness as merely play or amusing diversion, but this is not so. This is a temporary illness where alcohol heat raises yang qi and disturbs heart blood. When the alcohol heat subsides, the heart blood also settles, so there is nothing abnormal. However, generally with anything, once it becomes disturbed, it is difficult to restore to its original state. Can the corruption and disturbance of heart blood truly be restored to its original condition? Even if disturbed once, if it often settles again, it might restore to its original state. But heavy drinkers are not like this. They are drunk in the morning and sober in the evening, sober today and drunk tomorrow. They are often disturbed and rarely settled.

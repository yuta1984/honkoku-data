causes death. Or again, in spring and summer when there are many fights and disputes among the lower classes in society, common people think this is the season for quarrels and arguments. This too is probably a type of alcohol-induced madness syndrome in those who are already affected by the yang qi of spring and summer, then further disturbed by alcohol, which is a yang substance. Since these are all illnesses, even when such people exist, we should not simply hate or mock them.

Therefore, though alcohol is just one substance, the fact that it causes various afflictions depending on the person and the season is truly frightening. I will discuss alcohol-induced madness syndrome in detail in the pathology section at the end. There are also interesting stories, which I will relate when discussing alcohol-induced disorders.

○One should not drink much during winter cold. The Inner Classic states: "The three months of winter are called 'closing and storing.' Do not disturb the yang, do not let the skin leak and cause qi to be stolen away. Going against this harms the kidneys. Also, in autumn and winter, nourish yin and follow its root." These are words from the "Four Qi Regulating Spirit Theory," and winter preservation should be like this. However, alcohol disturbs yang, damages yin, causes the skin to leak, steals qi, and harms the kidneys - nothing is more severe than this. All of this goes against what is appropriate for winter. Though alcohol's heat seems to ward off cold qi for a while, it only lasts while there is heat during intoxication. After sobering up, one's inability to withstand wind and cold exceeds that of those who don't drink.

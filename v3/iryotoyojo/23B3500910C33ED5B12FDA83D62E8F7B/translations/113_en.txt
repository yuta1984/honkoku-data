Many people who drink alcohol have this (chronic phlegm). Alcohol qi rises and becomes fire, and both the lungs and stomach cavity receive this fire pathogen, causing stagnation that becomes phlegm. Generally, symptoms of dizziness and vertigo are mostly caused by wind-phlegm, but this too is due to alcohol. Luo Qianfu treated an elderly person's wind-phlegm dizziness and said this was because he enjoyed drinking alcohol when young. Zhu Danxi said that all diseases arise from phlegm, but not all people with phlegm necessarily develop various diseases. The type of phlegm that readily causes various diseases is only alcohol phlegm. However, this is not because phlegm transforms and causes various diseases.

"If not removed when it's a sprout, eventually one will need to use an axe." This means that even with trees, when they are seedlings they are easy to remove, but once they become large trees they are difficult to remove. Therefore, understanding that alcohol's production of phlegm is the sprout of serious illness, if one stops excessive drinking and treats this, there should be no worry of developing serious illness. Many people who develop symptoms like chronic cough with phlegm and bloody phlegm due to alcohol damaging their internal organs are common, and such conditions are also difficult to treat. The "Standards for Diagnosis and Treatment" states, "Drinking cold or hot alcohol injures the lungs and causes coughing. This is called 'attacking the lungs.'" People commonly say, "I constantly suffer from phlegm, so I avoid foods like taro and other harmful substances and take medicines, but why does it never heal? This must be an incurable disease."

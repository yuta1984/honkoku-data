Since treatment is difficult unless the wound opening is cut open to scrape out the debris, surgical incision is used. If fragments are near the wound opening, there is no need to make an incision; even washing with a syringe will remove torn cloth pieces. For pottery shards, iron fragments, and bullet fragments, they should be removed using tweezers, iron spatulas, and the double-hook extractors and goose-beak forceps illustrated in the previous volume. If fingers can be inserted, scrape out with fingers, then wash with water or water mixed with wound healing solution. After that, soak lint cotton in the antiseptic water or wound healing solution mentioned at the end and insert it. For other treatments, follow the methods for treating sword wounds. For incisions, surgery has various instruments, but in emergencies at ordinary homes, razors or small knife handles may be used.

Also, when bullets fortunately do not hit bone and penetrate through flesh creating both entry and exit wounds, since the entry wound is small and the exit wound is large, wash the blood clots toward the exit wound, then insert lint cotton and cover both openings with ointment, egg-white cotton, or pressure cotton, wrapping with bandages. Around the wound area, soak a hand towel in cold water or water with a little vinegar and saltpeter, keeping it cold, and even after bandaging, wash frequently to remove heat from the skin and flesh. Alternatively, covering the wound with folded cotton cloth soaked in water mixed with vinegar and saltpeter, changing it occasionally, is also good. This is to prevent the development of severe heat that would promote suppuration.

For people with deep compassion, even horses become well-tamed and completely manageable. How much more so when there is no true benevolent feeling toward people - such persons are of no use in great emergencies. In all matters, superiors are assisted by subordinates, and subordinates are blessed by superiors - this is how worldly affairs are accomplished.

One must not greedily devour watermelons, melons, and such at will. Do not pick and eat mushrooms of unknown name. I have seen and heard of people dying suddenly from poisoning. ※Note: How to counteract mushroom poisoning is recorded in later sections. Heavy drinking should be strictly prohibited from the outset. In military camps, when something might happen at any time cannot be predicted in advance, so

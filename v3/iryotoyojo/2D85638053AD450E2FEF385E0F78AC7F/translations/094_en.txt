naturally manifests itself, and as one's emotions become serene and expansive, one naturally attains true joy of the heart. At the ultimate achievement of this efficacy, one becomes a being that cannot be burned by fire, drowned by water, or harmed by swords or cannons - such are the miraculous effects. Moreover, these four medicinal substances are not things searched for and obtained from deep valleys or ocean depths, nor are they things imported from distant foreign lands. Rather, they grow naturally within the garden of human nature itself, and when harvested, they flourish ever more abundantly with their potency gradually increasing - they are spiritual medicines that will never be exhausted even if taken throughout one's lifetime. The nature and efficacy of propriety (rei), the primary medicine among these, is the law of heaven and earth and the fundamental essence of the human heart. Both the equilibrium before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure have yet to be expressed, and the harmony that achieves proper moderation after they have been expressed, are completely contained within this propriety, making it the source of the transformation and nurturing of all things.

Our country has maintained an unbroken imperial lineage since the age of the gods, and the proper distinction between ruler and subject naturally accords with this propriety and does not violate the laws of heaven and earth - this is why we excel among all nations of the world. In our country's divine classics, Ame-no-Minakanushi-no-Kami represents precisely this fundamental essence of propriety. Therefore, when one uses this propriety to maintain one's proper station and eliminate private desires and preferences, the circulation of vital energy and blood and the digestion of food naturally become healthy, and both advancement and retreat, all movements, come to accord with the principles of propriety. Thus, this propriety has the efficacy of thoroughly cleansing away self-indulgent behavior, abandoning selfish emotions, and consequently awakening benevolent love, righteousness, and courage. Therefore, Confucius said, "To overcome oneself and return to propriety is benevolence. If for one day one overcomes oneself and returns to propriety, all under heaven will return to benevolence" - speaking of the swiftness of this efficacy.

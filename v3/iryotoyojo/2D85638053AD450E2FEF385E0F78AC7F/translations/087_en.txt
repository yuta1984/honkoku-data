In this manner, one should select a skilled and trustworthy physician to entrust with the treatment. Also, even when an iron bullet does not penetrate the flesh but merely transmits its impact deeply into the interior through armor or similar protection, the skin and flesh in that area may swell greatly and soon rupture from within. Since people find this strange and doubtful, the reason should first be clarified.

Generally, human life and activity on earth occurs within the atmosphere that fills the space between heaven and earth with no gaps whatsoever. The external qi pushes the body inward, while the internal qi pushes the body outward. Both the external and internal pressure arise entirely from the tensile force of this qi, and their fundamental source is singular. To use an analogy for humans existing within this qi: it is like many sieves floating where both inside and outside are entirely water. In our country's ancient texts, this fundamental source is called Ame-no-Minakanushi-no-Kami, the tensile force is called Takami-Musubi-no-Kami, and the pressure is called Kami-Musubi-no-Kami.

"Taka" means "vigorous expansion," "Kami" means "biting pressure," and "Musubi" means the creative transformation of "binding and forming." Calling the fundamental source "Minakanushi" has no different meaning from the so-called "center of the undeveloped," and is the same as saying that the two principles of yin and yang arise from the Great Ultimate. Through the correspondence between this atmosphere's expansion and compression, free movement is achieved. {{Small text: In Buddhist scriptures, this is called the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni, Prabhutaratna, and the four Bodhisattvas. Their essential meaning is the same.}}

However, when a bullet flies by, it creates a vacuum in this external qi, {{Small text: The震動 of firearms is produced by the collision between the gunpowder's discharge and this external qi, creating sound.}} disrupting its equilibrium, causing sudden expansion from within that eventually leads to rupture resembling a stab wound. {{Small text: When there is internal expansion that does not lead to rupture of skin and flesh, but merely deep internal penetration of the impact, immediate death occurs.}}

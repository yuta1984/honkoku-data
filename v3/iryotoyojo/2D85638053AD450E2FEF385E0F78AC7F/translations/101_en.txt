Separately, what is called Ibuki veratrum grows in Omi Province. This is the variety called water veratrum according to Su Song's explanation. It also grows around Kyoga Peak in Ise Province and Yumoto area of Mount Nikko in Shimotsuke Province. Since it sprouts early in spring, it has the name "snow-breaking grass." There is also a variety with narrow leaves

and green flowers. In the dialect of Owari Province, it is called aoyagi grass. What is called wood veratrum has the Japanese name uji grass. Since it kills maggots, when maggots appear in miso, adding this grass makes the miso return to its original state, hence it is also called miso-naoshi (miso restorer). While this plant has insecticidal effects, it can hardly be called an emetic, and is naturally a different species.

It is abundant on Mount Ibuki in Omi Province. Since it grows more abundantly than in Sado Province or Mount Nikko in Shimotsuke Province, it has the name Nikko orchid. In spring it produces shoots from perennial roots. The leaf width is about 5-6 bu, length about 1 shaku, deep green color, with many vertical wrinkles, resembling palm seedlings. Roots that have aged for years have leaf widths reaching 3-4 sun. In summer it extends one stem 2-3 shaku long, small leaves grow alternately, and purple-black small flowers bloom on each branch. They are 3-4 bu in size with 6 petals and have an odor. Later they form short, flat pods with seeds inside. The root taste is pungent and astringent. What Su Song calls "scallion-white veratrum" is because the root resembles scallion roots. This root is used medicinally. Fresh ones are particularly excellent for inducing vomiting.

Cotton cloth
　To tear it, do it like this
　　　　　　　　to tear it.
　Keep both selvages aside,
　　for use when bones are broken
　to make splints or backing boards
　　　for weaving.
　For use as bandage cotton for sword wounds,
　　depending on the body part,
　　there are wide and narrow ones,
　but generally
　　tear into six or seven pieces.

　This diagram was published in
　　the "Essential Knowledge for Sick Households"
　　　that I wrote years ago,
　　　　　　where it was recorded in detail.

These selvages are not used for bandage cotton,

Spreading cotton

　The shapes of spreading cotton
　　　are various,
　　but here I show
　　　　five types of forms.

　Double roll

　　　　　Single roll

Use what is called
　　bleached cotton for all. In each case,
　tear them in advance,
　　roll them like this,
　　　and store them in an armor chest.

Pressure cotton

Soak in healing water
　or vinegar,
　　this is cotton
　　　applied to sword wounds. Ordinary
　　　　　　hand towels can also be used.

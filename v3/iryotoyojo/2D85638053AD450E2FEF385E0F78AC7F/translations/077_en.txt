Only the mouth and nose should be exposed while the patient lies down. 《Marginal note: First applying cold water from beneath ice, then pouring slightly warmer water is for gradual warming, so if there are no artesian wells available, a little hot water should be added to cold water for use》 Even after doing this, one should massage in reverse direction from the extremities to the shoulders and back, then blow sneezing powder into the nose. 《Marginal note: Sneezing medicine was discussed in the previous volume. Soap pod and wild ginger are also used as sneezing medicines. Using pepper powder alone is also good. White mustard seed powder is also good》

Even when recovery seems apparent, internal medicines must never be used while breathing remains faint. Only after observing that breath emerges and the tongue moves slightly should Sini decoction be used. Rather than giving large amounts at once, it is better to administer small amounts frequently. The therapeutic methods described here should be cross-referenced with the previous volume to understand the essential principles beforehand. 《Marginal note: In places like Echigo, those who die in snowstorms are invariably those who have consumed alcohol and attempt to proceed relying on its effects. This is because the severe cold causes the pores to close, preventing the alcohol vapors from dispersing》

《Marginal note: The vapors press upon the internal organs, causing mental confusion, and eventually breathing ceases. When traveling to Ezo regions, such incidents will likely be frequent, so they should be treated with the therapeutic methods described here》 There is something that should be mentioned in passing. To survive winter in cold regions like Ezo, one should first select suitable ground for settlement, keeping the south open, building embankments from east to northwest, planting many trees that will flourish densely to block the passage of cold winds. In northern regions, through nature's ingenious design, stones that are soft and brittle in quality yet can withstand fire will naturally occur. Already in places like Kanuma and Utsunomiya in Shimotsuke, there are many such stones, which are used instead of walls to build storehouses and houses, or even as roof tiles. Ezo lands must have many places that produce these stones. If obtained, these stones should be used to build up the area under the floor, and timber used to construct houses on top

The approximate quantity should be two to three gō of vinegar added to one to of water. 《Marginal note: Vinegar spoils easily and insects generate in it most rapidly, so old vinegar must not be used.》 Also, if the ground need not be dug deeply and there is a place where clean water springs forth, it is good to have many wells dug and put small stones mixed with sand at the bottom. If there is an old well at a place where a camp is set up at a former fortress site, one should draw out all the water and then use the water that springs forth afterward. To test water for use, light a candle and lower it into the well - if it goes out, there is poison. In such cases, draw fresh water from elsewhere, pour much of it into the well from above to disperse the stagnant air, then lower the fire to test. If

Therefore, fish that lack this air bladder remain only at the bottom of the water and never float to the surface. (The air bladder of the stone fish (ishimochi) is processed to make glue, which is considered the finest fish glue, hence this fish is also called "nibe.") Insects have neither gills like fish nor air bladders, so they have separate tubes on the sides of their bodies that serve as lungs for breathing. This is why grass insects move their wings when they chirp, and some have voices that are loud relative to their body size. Horses are beasts meant to serve humans, so their lungs are particularly large, making them well-suited for floating in water. Their manes shield them from rain, dew, and sunlight, and their tails have tendons called "tail tubes" that work like a ship's rudder. Their four large hooves are powerful for paddling water, so that half their body will always float above water, created by the marvelous craftsmanship of the Creator.

Being animals created this way, humans should be able to cross water while mounted in the saddle. However, due to the trend toward extravagant customs that value only outward appearance, even horses - which would naturally be healthy and actually stronger if left to their innate nature in the fields, eating wild grass raw and drinking water - are instead fed primarily rice bran, barley, and soybeans to make them fat and glossy with beautiful coats. Their manes that should protect them from sunlight, rain, and snow, as well as the sinews of their tails, are cut off, and even their hooves that should paddle water are trimmed away, thus completely destroying their natural endowments. With only their lung air sacs remaining, they cannot move freely across water as intended, and only their chest area floats above water.

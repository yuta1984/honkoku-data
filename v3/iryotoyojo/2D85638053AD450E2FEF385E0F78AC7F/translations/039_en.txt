For those who have suffered burns or
　sword wounds to the head,
　　there are various ways to bandage them.
　　Here I show
　　　　three different methods.

If you master
　　how to properly bandage the head,
　all other methods can be
understood. The true method of head
　bandaging is detailed with diagrams
　　in volume six of "Essential Knowledge for Sick Households"
　which should be consulted.
　　What is shown here
　　　　are all simplified methods.

Cotton cloth should be
　torn like this
　　for use.
　Hand towels will also
　　　suffice.
　　Here I demonstrate
　　　　emergency first aid
　　　　　　　measures
　　　　　　　　　using
　　　　　　　　　　　ordinary hand towels.

Apply the cloth marked イ (A)
　to the forehead and
　　　　　　　tie it behind.
Wrap the one marked ニ (B)
　　　　　　　around the front of the head
　and tie it. Take ハ (C) from behind the ears
to under the chin, and ロ (D) goes from in front of the ears
　　　　　　　　down to tie under the chin.

Under the chin,
　　like this,
　　　you must separately
　　　　fold cotton cloth and apply it,
　　　　otherwise there will be difficulty
　　　　　with eating, drinking, and speaking.

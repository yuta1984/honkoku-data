was used, so since this is also recorded there, it should be referenced. 《Ise Heizō says: A certain archery manual speaks of "training" with the bow. Training means that when learning initially, one does not draw a bow that exceeds one's strength, but draws an appropriate bow that can be freely drawn with one's own power, and practices shooting with correct form. When drawing a bow that exceeds one's strength, it is not oneself drawing the bow, but the bow drawing oneself. Though one intends to draw a strong bow, because the bow is strong, one is pulled by the bow, clenching teeth, being violently jerked upward from the chest, with the area from the abdomen down to both leg joints floating up, the waist becoming weak, both arms bent and unable to extend, gasping for breath upward, the chest extremely distressed, arms trembling, and while one tries to hold and draw the bow, the bow seeks to release, so strength is insufficient and one releases against one's will, thus greatly missing the target. Various bad habits with the bow arise from being pulled by strong bows, with shooting form becoming disordered and improper due to lack of adjustment. Beginning students think that with strong bows arrows will fly sharply and far, and though they prefer strong bows, with strong bows one's power does not enter the bow, and as it releases with only the bow's power, the arrow's force is weak and does not reach far, falling midway. If one shoots with a bow appropriate to one's strength that can be freely drawn, one's power and the bow's power harmonize, the form does not become disordered and is well-adjusted, so the whole body's power enters the bow, the arrow's force is also sharp, reaching far without missing the target. In recent times, masters who teach disciples with the goal of Sanjūsangendō's through-shooting all prefer having disciples draw strong bows. This is because they want to shoot through the hall with the bow's power. If one constantly prefers strong bows, one's form will be deranged and maladjusted for life, and archery will never be mastered. Moreover, through-shooting is useless for military purposes, serving only to gain fame for shooting many arrows, being a useless technique like a sideshow. This through-shooting means shooting through the thirty-three ken corridor. That hall has pillars built with two ken as one interval, so it is sixty-six ken.》

《Even if one shoots through sixty-six ken on the battlefield, that arrow cannot penetrate armor, and on the battlefield the method is to let enemies approach within seven or eight ken before shooting. If close, it will certainly penetrate armor. Also, bows used for through-shooting have inner bamboo that is hard and strong bamboo made thick, slightly fired and attached, while outer bamboo uses soft and weak bamboo made thin and attached, so they are devices with special mechanisms. Moreover, light arrows like hemp stalks cannot be used on battlefields, and shooting tens of thousands of arrows in one day and night is also useless. On battlefields one does not engage only in arrow warfare all day and night. Also, through-shooting archers bind their bellies with cloth, sip porridge and take medicine before shooting - such weakness is useless for battlefield purposes. No matter how much ancient people increased their arrow counts and gained fame as the best in the realm, doing things useless for battlefield purposes is the same as recreational arts, merely comforting viewers' eyes and surprising listeners' ears. Ultimately it is just selling one's name and seeking salary, not true martial arts. When this is properly learned, it is quicker than firearms and very useful for military purposes, so one would want to have true training, but in recent times both those who teach archery and those who learn it have come to train with through-shooting as their goal. This through-shooting is heretical to archery, so thoughtful warriors must never aspire to through-shooting. I think that bow and arrow have been used in our country since ancient times, and their greatness is unparalleled in the world. Even seeing that our founding Emperor Jinmu demonstrated his divine parentage through the heavenly hahaya arrows and foot quiver shows that this is the primary military implement for governing the world. Especially when weapons clash directly, the advantages of bow and arrow may exceed those of firearms. How much more so - learning what foot soldiers and hired troops do with clumsy implements like sword-mounted guns would probably benefit us little. Moreover, since warriors are called "houses of bow and arrow," this theory of Lord Ise...》

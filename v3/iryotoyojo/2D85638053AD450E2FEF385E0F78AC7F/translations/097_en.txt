Licorice and Dried Ginger Decoction
　　Licorice {{2 qian}} Dried Ginger {{1 qian}}
　　The above two ingredients: decoct 1 gō 2 shaku of water down to 6 shaku. {{People of our country often dislike the taste of licorice, so although licorice is the main medicine in this prescription, it is also acceptable to reduce the amount to equal parts with dried ginger, using 1 qian.}}
　　These two prescriptions are included here because there are explanations of them in the main text.

Prescription for Removing Arrowheads and Bullets
　　Praying mantis {{3 insects, kept alive, placed in triple-layered paper bags; after about 20 days they will die. If put in one bag together, they will bite each other, so they must be placed separately, one insect per bag, then dried in shade. In places like Edo, it is difficult to obtain live ones, so select fresh specimens stored at pharmacies and increase the amount to use 4 or 5 or more.}}
　　Snail {{1 piece, remove shell and dry in shade}}
　　Cattle lice {{3 pieces, dry in shade}}
　　The above three ingredients: grind to fine powder, mix with lamp oil and rice paste, and apply to the wound. The "One Hundred Articles on Military Customs" states: "Arrowheads are shot in, so unlike accidentally embedded needles or nails, they are difficult to remove."

Meiwa 2, Year of the Rooster
This corresponds to 127 years until Meiji 24
【Meiwa 2 = 1765. Meiji 24 = 1891. So this means it corresponds to 127 years from Meiwa 2 (actually 126 years, but this is probably counting in the traditional way)】

Long ago, this happened near the capital.
Around the fourth month, people invited one or two companions and
went out to fish in the river, enjoying themselves with nets,
when from downstream
a large ayu fish
swam up. It appeared to be over five shaku in length.
The people were startled
and stopped
their river fishing,
all returning
to their respective
homes.

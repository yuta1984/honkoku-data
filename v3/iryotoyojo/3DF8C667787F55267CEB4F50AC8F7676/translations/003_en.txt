Starting with the gathering day of the hand-made soba disciples, they all feast on soba until they crush their stomachs and use their food bowls as pillows - such intense matches, yet none can compare to the master. On August 16th, at a tea house called Shinanoya, they held a grand gathering. When they began eating with the spirit of "I won't be outdone," the serving staff were like assistants at a vendetta, causing heavenly commotion. As the saying goes, "Even if you bury ten thousand tsubo, nothing will grow" - it was so extreme that previous contestants became dizzy. Among the thirty participants, 121 bowls was the grand champion's record, while 65 bowls was a middling performance.

This is a proper meal. While some people can eat this much, those who say they can't stand to look at it for two or three days afterward simply lack proper training. These competitors could do the same again tomorrow without any feeling of heaviness or discomfort. Training is indeed a precious thing.

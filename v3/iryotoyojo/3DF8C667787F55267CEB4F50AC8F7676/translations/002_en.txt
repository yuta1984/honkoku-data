Here there is a man called Kisōhachi who loves buckwheat noodles (soba). While his enormous appetite may seem extraordinary, those who truly master any single art are rare. Even amateurs in the neighborhood usually eat soba until they feel sick, but that's only occasional - they can't keep it up continuously. He eats soba for both breakfast and dinner, and even makes it into ochazuke (tea-poured rice) for his late-night meal without any problem. Therefore, he is respected as a master teacher of soba-loving, and though he can eat any amount without ill effect, he appeared to be quite an extraordinary person.

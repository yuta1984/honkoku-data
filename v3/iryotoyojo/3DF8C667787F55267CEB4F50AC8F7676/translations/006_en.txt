Great Eating
It was around the eighth hour of the night in the third month (around 2 PM), and since it was quite timely, Jūichihei of the tea-rice shop set his heart on visiting Enoshima shrine and departed alone. When he stopped to eat at Totsuka, he heartily consumed nara-cha (tea-rice) for lunch. A man who sat down nearby ordered nara-cha and smoothly consumed five servings by himself, acting completely nonchalant about it. Jūichihei was astonished and thought, "Generally speaking, no one can match me when it comes to tea-rice!" "Whether he's a tengu or a monster from beyond Shinano, my supremacy won't be surpassed," he wondered suspiciously. From then on, he struck up a conversation, and as it turned out, this fellow was also traveling alone to visit Enoshima shrine. While talking, they decided to stay the night in Totsuka.

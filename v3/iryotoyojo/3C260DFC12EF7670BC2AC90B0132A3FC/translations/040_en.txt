should not matter. One should simply follow the person's decline and vigor. There are people with vigorous and robust constitution who do not cease sexual intercourse even after seventy, yet have no illness in their body and even beget children. These are people whose heaven-granted lifespan is exceptionally long and who have surplus kidney qi. They are not ordinary people. However, when ordinary people imitate them and enjoy sexual intercourse in old age, they suddenly lose their lives. How tragic this is.

○ True yin essence is like the oil in a lamp. If one does not let it leak even once, it is like adding oil to a lamp's flame.

○ If essence leaks and is given to a woman, children are born. If it is retained in one's own body, it creates one's own life. Even sexual intercourse for the purpose of producing offspring, if forced, leads to weakness and illness. How much more should one regret wastefully spending it on empty pleasures.

○ Even though there is a way of harmonious union, one must not carelessly leak essence. Moreover, if one tries to forcibly retain it when it is already about to leak, it will not return to its source but will stagnate midway, causing venereal poison and ulcers.

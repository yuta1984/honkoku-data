Moreover, in spring and summer when yang qi prevails, they enter rooms to take afternoon naps, and in autumn and winter when yin qi prevails, they go out to mountains and fields to hunt birds and beasts, exhausting their bodies and disregarding wind and cold. This is truly the beginning of all diseases arising.

○In spring, sleep late at night and rise early, walk widely to generate spirit-qi.

○In summer, sleep late at night and rise early, disperse your qi. Do not become angry.

○In autumn, sleep early and rise early, cause your spirit-qi to contract and converge.

○In winter, sleep early and rise late, necessarily wait for the sun to rise. Let your will/intention rest inwardly.

○When summer is severely cold or winter is severely hot, this is called "irregular qi"—the qi of heaven and earth is bad. If at such times you go outside and expose yourself to this, you will suffer from seasonal illness. You should be cautious.

○During intense heat, do not expose yourself to the sun. Sit in cool places. Also, do not stay in places that are extremely cool where wind passes through.

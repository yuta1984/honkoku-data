to rinse your mouth, as it will damage your teeth.

○When combing your hair after rising in the morning, it is good to comb many times - several hundred strokes or more. Also, you should comb at any time. This expels wind, circulates qi, and clarifies the eyes.

○Do not become angry upon rising in the morning.

○Do not count money upon rising in the morning.

○Do not look at corpses on an empty stomach after rising in the morning. The foul odor will enter your nose and become poison. If you must see one, drink alcohol before looking.

○When going out early in the morning on an empty stomach, roast some ginger and hold a little in your mouth. You will not be harmed by fog and dew. Also, eating rice and drinking alcohol will expel miasmatic qi. Long ago, three people traveled together in the fog early in the morning. One was on an empty stomach, one ate porridge, and one drank alcohol. The one with an empty stomach died, the one who ate porridge became ill, and the one who drank alcohol remained healthy. This is because the nature of alcohol prevents wind-cold, fog and dew, and expels evil qi. However, do not become greatly intoxicated.

○Do not exhaust your body with labor in the evening.

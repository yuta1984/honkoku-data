year technique." If one uses yang-tonifying medicaments excessively, true yin will be depleted and consumed, giving rise to diseases such as sores, urinary disorders, and thirst conditions. If one uses yin-tonifying medicaments excessively, the stomach qi will become deficient and cold, making food and drink difficult to digest and causing difficulty with bowel and urinary movements. It is also said that "all diseases and accumulations arise from deficiency." When the middle and lower burners become deficient, there may be fullness and oppression in the heart and abdomen, yet using medicines to kill parasites and dissolve accumulations further depletes and damages the middle qi. Also, if one frequently takes dispersing medicines after being slightly affected by wind-cold pathogenic factors, the interstices become loose and empty, spontaneous sweating and night sweats appear, and external pathogens become increasingly easy to enter. When severely affected by pathogenic factors, one should take medicine early while the disease is in the skin to induce sweating, but if one is negligent at that time and seeks medicine only after the disease has entered the bone marrow, not even one in ten cases will recover. One should reflect upon the historical account of Bian Que and Duke Huan. It is essential to distinguish between mild and severe pathogenic conditions. Although many books on life cultivation have come from China until now, they are difficult for common folk to easily understand. Therefore, I have examined ancient and modern texts together, extracted their essence and summarized their key points, expressing them in Japanese vernacular. I hope that even country farmers and village old women will widely hear of this way and constantly practice it with care.

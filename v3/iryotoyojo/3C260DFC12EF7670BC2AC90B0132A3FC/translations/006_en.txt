is no different from rushing. Regarding human lifespan, it is said that with Heaven's essence of sixty, Earth's essence of sixty, and Human essence of sixty, one can be born with a total lifespan of one hundred and eighty years. However, if one goes against the way of cultivation and nourishment, one's life diminishes day by day and month by month, leading to premature death. Those whose vital essence is not firm will have their Heaven-element lifespan reduced; those who have no proper timing in their daily activities and whose joy and anger are irregular will have their Earth-element lifespan reduced; those who have no moderation in food and drink will have their Human-element lifespan reduced. Therefore, the way of preservation and nourishment is indispensable from youth through middle age to old age. The sage said, "Treat what has not yet become disordered, do not treat what has already become disordered; treat what has not yet become diseased, do not treat what has already become diseased." Once illness has already developed, even with good medical treatment, complete recovery is difficult. Treating during the pre-illness stage should be called nourishing life. Master Sun Zhenren said, "After the age of forty, fine medicine should not leave one's body." Truly, after middle age, one should constantly use medicines that nourish qi and blood. However, one should use mild tonifying medicinal foods, not harsh tonics. Also, one should not forcefully favor tonifying medicines. Medicine is for attacking pathogenic factors and balancing what is uneven. To generate through medicine vital energy that one is not born with would be like creating waves where there is no wind. The Dongshen Zhenjing states: "In nourishing life, not causing damage is what constitutes extending life."

1. Movement and Rest Through the Four Seasons and Day and Night

The human body resembles heaven and earth. The roundness of the head models itself after heaven, and the squareness of the feet models itself after earth. The eyes are the sun and moon, hair and bone-flesh are mountains-forests and earth-stones, breathing is wind, blood and fluids are rivers and seas, the four limbs are the four seasons, the five organs are the five elements, and the six bowels are the six musical pitches. In this way, everything models itself after heaven and earth. Therefore, it is essential that rising, resting, movement, and stillness follow heaven and earth. One should be active when the sun rises and rest when the sun sets. Also, in spring and summer, the qi of heaven and earth rises and floats upward, causing the flowers and leaves of plants and trees to flourish luxuriantly, and insects and beasts to fly and move about. In autumn and winter, the qi of heaven and earth descends and sinks, causing plants and trees to return to their roots, and birds and beasts to enter their nests and burrows. People should do likewise—in spring and summer, move the body and let the spirit-qi rise up; in autumn and winter, keep the body still and let the spirit-qi settle down. If one does this, the qi and blood will be harmonious and smooth, and diseases of the sinews and bones should not arise. However, people today do not sleep until late at night, then sleep until late morning. Moreover, they eat and drink and then go back to sleep.

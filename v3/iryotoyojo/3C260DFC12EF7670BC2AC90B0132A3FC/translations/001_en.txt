●The Model Answer Collection is a collection that allows you to proceed with transcription while checking your own answers against transcribed books published by the National Diet Library as reference materials.
●The reference transcribed books may use different notation from the original work for readability, such as converting kana to kanji or adding diacritical marks and punctuation. When inputting, please follow the "Minna de Honkoku" (Everyone's Transcription) guideline rules, prioritize the original book's notation, and transcribe exactly as you see it.
●There may be differences in text and composition between the reference transcribed book and the original work due to different editions. In such cases, please prioritize the situation of the original work when transcribing.

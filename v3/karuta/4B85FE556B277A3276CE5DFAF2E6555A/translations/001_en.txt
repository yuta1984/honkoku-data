Hyakunin Isshu Picture Commentary, Volume 3

【Main Text】
The meaning of this poem is that "ashibiki" is a makurakotoba (pillow word) that modifies "mountain." The word "shidario" is used to express "naganagashi" (long and drawn out). "Shidario" refers to the long, drooping tail of a mountain pheasant, and is used to express an endlessly long night. The meaning is that autumn nights are long and drawn out, and while it would be painful even sleeping with someone, sleeping alone makes it impossible to fall asleep at all.

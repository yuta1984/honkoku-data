Semimaru

This is the place where
those who go
and those who return
part ways

those who know
and those who don't know
at Osaka Barrier

Hyakunin Isshu Picture Commentary

The heart of this poem expresses the principle that all phenomena return to the same fundamental truth. Those who go and those who return, those who know and those who don't know, temporarily part but cannot escape the various barriers of life and death. However, to reach the capital of ultimate reality (the Pure Land), one must pass through this barrier, or it would be difficult to meet. He composed this poem with deep feeling about the world. It is mistaken to think this person was merely blind.

One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets with Illustrations, Number Sixteen

The spirit of this poem is as follows: When Yukihira was appointed as Governor of Inaba and was to govern that province, he traveled down to that country. At that time, his acquaintances held a farewell banquet for him. When asked when he would return, he said that if there were people waiting for him, he would return immediately, and composed this poem. However, it was a poem that harbored the true feeling that there would probably be no one waiting for him. "Inaba no yama" means the mountains of Inaba Province.

Middle Counselor Yukihira
If you should ask
whether I am the pine
growing on the peaks
of Inaba's mountains—
I would return at once

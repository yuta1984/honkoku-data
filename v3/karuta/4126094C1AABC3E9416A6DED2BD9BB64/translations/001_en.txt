Number Eighty-three
This sentiment is clear. As one gradually comes to long for the past, even the present age that one finds disagreeable will, in times to come, also become dear and nostalgic, reminding us that the past was indeed precious. This is a poem that should resonate with all people. Everything deteriorates over time, falling short of what it once was - this is the lament expressed.

(Now longed for)
(The world once seen as sorrowful)
(Will clear)
(remembering)
Also in recent times
(If one lives long)

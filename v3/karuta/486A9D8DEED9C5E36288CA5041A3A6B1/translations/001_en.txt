Hyakunin Isshu Illustrated Commentary, Number Twenty-One

【Main Text】
The meaning of this poem is about waiting for the moon at dawn. It is not just about one night, but from early autumn, based only on casual words saying "I will come soon," the poet waited faithfully, and by the time it became the ninth month, that person never came, and instead the poet waited for the dawn moon to appear. This is composed with deep pathos. This dawn moon refers to the moon that appears after the twentieth day of the lunar month, explaining the metaphor of long waiting.

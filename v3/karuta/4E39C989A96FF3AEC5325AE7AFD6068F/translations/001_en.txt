【Main Text】
This heart refers to the spring water that flows particularly abundantly at Izumi River. The poem uses "Izumi River" to create a wordplay with "izumi ki" (spring coming). The person I once loved deeply has now completely disappeared from my life, and I can barely remember their face, yet my longing feelings still do not cease. Why do I alone continue to miss someone I haven't seen for so long, like water continuously springing forth?
This is a poem where the poet questions his own heart. Mikano-hara's Izumi River is a famous place in Yamashiro Province.

The meaning of the poem on the left is: Ever since I began to think of you, I had been lamenting with a single-minded desire just to meet you. However, after we spent one night together, from the morning of our parting, sometimes it became difficult to meet as I wished, and sometimes I worried whether that person's heart might change - the varieties of anxious thoughts multiplied, making the suffering in the poem before we met seem like nothing at all. The deeper the feelings become after meeting, the more the anxious thoughts increase.

"Compared to my heart after we met and saw each other, in the past I had no worries at all"

Translation: When I compare my current state of mind to how it was after we met, I realize that in the past I had no troubles or anxious thoughts whatsoever.

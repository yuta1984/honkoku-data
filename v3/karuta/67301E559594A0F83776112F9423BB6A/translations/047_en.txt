Kōkamon'in no Bettō
At Naniwa Bay,
on a single night's
temporary sleep
among the reeds—
should I exhaust myself
with endless longing?

This poem expresses the heart of love encountered at a travel lodging. First, it should be understood as a travel lodging in Naniwa. It uses a play on words with "karine" (temporary sleep) of the reeds (ashi) famous in that place—since reeds have joints (fushi), and one joint is called "hitoyo," it refers to "one night" (hitoyo). "Miwozukushi" (exhausting oneself) also appears often in poems about Naniwa Bay—the mooring posts that serve as ship markers are called "miwozukushi," which is used as a pun for "exhausting oneself." Even a single night's temporary intimacy brings intense longing. How much more so would a familiar, cherished bond be? It also contains the sentiment wondering what will ultimately become of it all.

Princess Shokushi
O cord of life,
if you must break, then break!
If I live on,
my power to keep
this secret love may weaken.

This poem expresses the heart of secret love. "Tama no o" (cord of jewels) refers to one's life. "If my life must end, let it end; if I live on, my heart's ability to keep this secret will likely weaken, and eventually people will know, and scandalous rumors will spread, bringing ruin both to that person and to myself"—this is what the poem expresses with such concern. From "tama no o" comes "taenaba taene" (if it breaks, let it break), and thinking from present feelings to the future, the longer one lives, the more shameful things will become. ○ In Kigin's commentary, "taenaba taene" means "if it must break, then let it break completely." It's the same as saying "shiratsuyu wa kienaba kien" (if the white dew must vanish, let it vanish). "Yowari mo zo suru" means "it will likely weaken."

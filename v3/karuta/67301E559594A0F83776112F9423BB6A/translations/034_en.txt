Sei Shōnagon
Though you may scheme
in the depths of night
with the false crow
of a rooster,
I will not allow passage
through the barrier
at Meeting Hill

The heart of this poem is that when a certain person came visiting and tried to leave late at night, she detained him, saying he should return quietly since the barrier gates should not yet be opened. "False crow of a rooster" refers to an ancient Chinese story where a man named Lord Mengchang, having been defeated in battle, tried to pass through the barrier called Hangu Pass, but since it was late at night the barrier gates would not open. His retainer Jimei was skilled at imitating roosters, so when he crowed they thought dawn had come and let them through the barrier. That aside, even if one tried to deceive this Ōsaka barrier by imitating a rooster, she would absolutely not allow passage.

If only I could say
directly, not through others,
just this:
"Now I can only
think until
my thoughts
cease entirely"

The heart of this poem is passionate love. Even occasional expressions of affection come only through intermediaries, not as his heart wishes. Even if he should die of love in this state, if he could at least meet directly and speak his heart's full measure, there would be no resentment. Now his thoughts only intensify and he laments that his very life may come to an end. The preface states: "Composed when he was secretly visiting a person who had come up from the vicinity of Ise Shrine, but when even His Majesty heard of this affair, he assigned watchful women and such, making it impossible to visit even in secret."

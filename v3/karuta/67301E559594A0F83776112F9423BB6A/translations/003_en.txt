　Emperor Tenji
In the autumn fields,
At the harvest hut
Where they cut the grain—
The rough thatch gives no shelter,
And my sleeves are wet with dew.

The meaning of this poem is that around the time when huts are built in autumn fields, as autumn comes to an end, the thatch and other materials decay and deteriorate, leaving no means to ward off the dew, so that one's sleeves become wet. This is His Majesty's poem of personal reflection on the imperial way, and it was selected to begin Teika's collection of one hundred poems because it honors His Majesty's compassionate heart toward the people. "Kariho" refers to a temporary hut. According to imperial commentary, it is written as "borrowed hut" in the Man'yōshū. Kigin's commentary states that for the sovereign of ten thousand chariots to show compassion for the people is the mark of a sage ruler and virtuous king, and that this emperor particularly took to heart the detailed work of farmers.

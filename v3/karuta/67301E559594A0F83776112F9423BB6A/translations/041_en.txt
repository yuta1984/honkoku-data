Hōshōji Lay Priest, Former Regent and Grand Minister of State
From Wada Bay
rowing out
and gazing—
the distant white-capped waves
upon the offing
merge with the eternal
realm of clouds

The heart of this poem: "Wada no hara" is a general name for the sea. When one rows a boat far out to sea and gazes upon it, truly the realm of clouds and the waves become one, stretching endlessly into the distance. "Hisakata" is a makura-kotoba (pillow word) used before "cloud realm." This is a poem that skillfully evokes the scenery and expresses the boundless appearance of the sea. Its lingering emotion is limitless. The headnote states: "Composed when the Retired Emperor Shin'in, while on the throne, had poems composed on the theme 'Distant View of the Sea.'"

Sutoku-in (Emperor Sutoku)
The rapids so swift—
the torrent blocked
by rocks
divides, yet I believe
we shall meet again
at the river's end

【Left Page Top】
The heart of this poem: Even when the water of a swift torrent is blocked by rocks in the rapids and divides to left and right, once it passes around those rocks, it meets again. The love between you and me is the same—even if there is a temporary separation and our relationship divides, as long as our hearts remain unchanged, I believe we will intimately meet again in the end. "Warete mo" means the same as "wari naku" (unreasonably/helplessly). The Ki-chū commentary states: By saying "blocked by rocks," he expresses the feeling of not being able to meet; by saying "warete mo," he expresses the feeling of definitely wanting to meet.

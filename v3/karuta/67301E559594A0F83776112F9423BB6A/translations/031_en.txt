Izumi Shikibu
When I am no longer
in this world,
as a memory
from beyond this life,
would that there might be
just one more
meeting.

This poem was composed and sent by Shikibu to someone close to her when she was ill. "Arazaran" means that her life was precarious and uncertain. "This world's exterior" refers to the next world. "Omoide" means to recall as a source of pleasure. The meaning is: "I am now so ill that I do not think I can live much longer, so at least when I leave this world and go to the Buddha's land, so that I may recall it from time to time as a source of joy, I wish there could be one more meeting." This court lady was called Izumi Shikibu because she became the wife of Izumi no Kami Michisada. The headnote says "sent to someone when she was feeling unwell."

Murasaki Shikibu (Lady Murasaki)
We met by chance
and I saw you, but
before I could tell
if it was really you,
you disappeared
behind clouds—
like the moon
at midnight.

The meaning of this poem is: after traveling far away and returning, she encountered a familiar friend on the road but lost sight of them before she could properly recognize who it was, and she composed this poem comparing it to the moon hiding behind clouds. In the commentary by Genshi Hōin: "The way one meets a person and immediately parts is just like watching the moon suddenly hide behind clouds." The way of speaking that compares a person to the moon is completely beyond the reach of ordinary understanding.

Taikenmon'in no Horikawa
How long will last
your heart—
I do not know.
My black hair
in disarray,
this morning
I can only
think of you.

This poem was sent to that person on the morning after their meeting. "How long will last" uses the image of black hair as a metaphor, expressing the sentiment of parting this morning and wondering when they will meet again. From mentioning "black hair," she says "in disarray, I think." "How long will last" refers to the person's heart, while "in disarray" refers to her own heart. "I do not know how long your heart will last" means: though we pledged our love for the future, since people's hearts are by nature changeable, not knowing what the future holds, I am in emotional turmoil over this morning's painful parting. ○Kigin's commentary states: The character "this morning" clearly carries the meaning of "the morning after."

I gaze toward
where the cuckoo
was crying—
but only
the dawn moon
remains there.

The heart of this poem: During the season of waiting for cuckoos, after many disappointing nights had passed, finally hearing just one call as if in a dream, barely catching the sound—when I look toward the sky where it should have gone, only the dawn moon remains, and the cuckoo has already vanished without a trace. Though there are many skillful cuckoo poems, this one does not rely on elaborate technique, yet it expresses deep emotion with limitless lingering sentiment.

Fujiwara no Michinobu Ason
Though I know
that dawn
will bring
the evening,
still I resent
this hateful
daybreak.

This is a "morning after" poem. Though one knows that when night ends, evening will come again, because of the pain of parting after meeting someone, this daybreak that came too quickly is resentful. In the Go-Shūi-shū, Collection 12 (Love), the headnote states "sent from a woman's place on a day when snow was falling upon returning," and two poems appear together. ○ "Does the path home change? Though unchanged, I am confused by the melting of this morning's light snow." The other poem is this "Though dawn has come" verse. Perhaps there is deep meaning in the phrase "though I know."

Michitsuna no Haha, Mother of the Right General
Sighing constantly,
alone through
the night until
dawn breaks—
how can you know
how long
such time feels?

The meaning of this poem is: a certain person who visited this lady was reproached for opening the gate late, so she composed this poem in response. You have two familiar women there, and you come here only rarely. So when I wait longingly, sighing constantly in my solitary bed, waiting for night to end—how sad do you think that long time feels? To reproach me even for the lateness in opening the gate is shallow, she says. In the Go-Shūi-shū, Collection 14 (Love 4), the headnote states "when the Lay Priest and Chancellor came to visit, because the gate was opened late and he expressed resentment, this was composed and presented."

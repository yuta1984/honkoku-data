Fujiwara no Toshiyuki Ason
At Suminoe's
shore the
waves that approach
even at night—
do they avoid
people's eyes
on the dream pathway?

【Right page upper】
The heart of this poem is that the waves approaching the shore at Suminoe serve as a preface to say "even at night." "Yogu" means "to avoid." At night on the dream pathway, there should be no need to avoid people's eyes, yet even in dreams, following the custom of keeping love secret in one's heart, one still appears to avoid people's eyes, unable to act as one's heart desires, lamenting "what can be done." If waves crashed against high cliffs, one's dreams would surely be awakened. This refers to Nankai (southern sea). Particularly, the shore of Suminoe is a place where even rough waves do not approach, yet the meaning is also implied: "How is it that this becomes an obstacle to my dream-path promises?"

Ise
At Naniwa Bay
even the brief
space between
reed joints—
without meeting,
should I pass
this world/night
away?

【Left page upper】
The heart of this poem is: to speak of reeds, she says "Naniwa Bay," and comparing the brief space between reed joints to the short time people sleep, she asks "should I pass this world without meeting?" This "yo" (world) also plays on "yo" (night) in the space between reed joints. She asks whether she should pass even the brief sleeping hours without rest. "Naniwa Bay" is very well expressed in general terms. In five syllables there are lord and retainer relationships; this represents the lord's five syllables. Also, in love there are beginning, middle, and end; this poem expresses the ending sentiment. Therefore, the heart counts up all the feelings that have accumulated until now. Such poems, if viewed only superficially, would have no interest.

Middle Counselor Yukihira
Standing to part
from Inaba
mountain's
peak where
pine trees
grow—if I hear you wait,
I will return now.

This poem was composed when Yukihira, as governor of Mino Province, was going down to that province, and when a friend who came to see him off asked "When will you return?" Inaba Mountain is a famous place in Mino Province. Saying "standing to part from Inaba" and "if I hear the pine trees growing on the peak," these are all in the style of preface poems. It is also said that when this lord, who had been governor of Inaba, finished his term and returned to the capital, he composed this and sent it to someone he cared for. The heart of the poem is: "If there were even someone waiting for me, I would return immediately. But there probably is no one waiting"—a poem with this understanding in mind.

Ariwara no Narihira Ason
In the vigorous
age of gods
never was it
heard
that Tatsuta River
bound water
in Chinese crimson.

In this poem, "chihayafuru" (vigorous) is a pillow word used to introduce "kami" (gods). The beauty of autumn leaves scattered and floating on Tatsuta River—though it is said that in the age of gods there were only wondrous things, even in that age of gods it was never heard that "water was bound in Chinese crimson brocade." This refers to tie-dyeing, where silk is tied with thread and dyed in various colors, used here as a comparison. It is also said that according to the preface, "when the Nijō Empress was called the Crown Prince's consort, this was composed as a poem on the theme of a folding screen painted with autumn leaves flowing down Tatsuta River."

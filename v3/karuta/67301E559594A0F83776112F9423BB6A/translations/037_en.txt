Emperor Sanjō
Not by my own will,
in this sorrowful
world
should I live longer,
how dear it would be—
the midnight moon

This poem was composed when His Majesty was gravely ill and was considering abdicating the throne. The meaning is that if, against his own wishes, he were to live longer, he would surely long for the autumn moon of the Imperial Palace. According to the seasonal commentary, "If I live longer against my true intention, how deeply I would long for the moon over the familiar golden halls and jeweled towers." Though it says "midnight moon," one should not limit the interpretation to the moon alone. There must be many things from the past that he would fondly remember.

The autumn leaves
of Mount Mimuro
blown by the storm
have become
the brocade
of Tatsuta River

The heart of this poem is that one should not thoughtlessly consider it disappointing when the storm scatters the autumn leaves of Mount Mimuro. The more one looks at the fallen leaves, the more they become the brocade of Tatsuta River, making it even more beautiful. There is nothing hidden in this poem. One should simply contemplate it by considering both the seasonal scenery and the nature of the place together. To compose so vividly is the result of the poet's own dedicated effort. According to the seasonal commentary, "The leaves scatter and fall from Mimuro, and below flows Tatsuta River. The autumn leaves of Mount Mimuro scattered by the storm have indeed become the brocade of Tatsuta River."

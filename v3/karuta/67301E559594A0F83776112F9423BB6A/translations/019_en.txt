Harumichi no Tsuraki
In the mountain stream
the wind has built
a barrier—
it is autumn leaves
that cannot even flow away

【Right page upper】
The meaning of this poem is about many leaves that the wind has blown onto a mountain stream, forming a barrier so that they cannot flow. What is this barrier that the wind has created? Looking closely, it is autumn leaves that cannot even flow away—this is a poem where the poet asks himself a question and answers it himself. The fact that the wind created it is beautiful. This poem was composed when crossing the mountains of Shiga. These five characters "yamakawa" (mountain stream) are used in the Man'yōshū to refer to "mountains and rivers." In that case, the character "kawa" (river) is read with a clear consonant. Here, the character "kawa" should be read with a voiced consonant. Also, when leaves flow and are blocked, this is called "shigarami" (barrier). "Aenu" is written with the character "kan" (dare/endure), meaning that the flow cannot be completed.

Ki no Tomonori
On this spring day
of tranquil
light
from eternal
heaven,
why do the blossoms
scatter so restlessly?

【Left page upper】
The meaning of this poem is that while it goes without saying that flowers scatter in rain and wind, it is regrettable that the flowers alone scatter restlessly even when no wind blows and the day is peaceful. On such a tranquil day, for what reason do the flowers scatter so busily? The particle "ran" in "chiru ran" (probably scatter) can be heard as well. The headnote says this was composed about cherry blossoms scattering.
Someone asked Lord Tameie whether the heart in this poem refers to a person's heart or the flowers' heart, and he replied that it should be understood as either. This poem could have said "the flowers indeed scattered," but by saying "probably scatter," it expresses a heart that deeply regrets their falling.

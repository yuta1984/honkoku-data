Minamoto no Shigeyuki
The wind so strong,
waves crash
against the rocks—
I alone
am broken,
lost in thoughts of love.

The meaning of this poem draws from a poem in the Man'yōshū: "The conch shell worn at a mountain priest's waist, trembling as it strikes the rock and breaks while lost in thought." Therefore, the heartless beloved is like a rock, and no matter how many times waves of emotion strike, they scatter and break apart. Though I do not intend to fall in love by gazing at this heartless person, I naturally fall into melancholy thoughts. ○ Kigin's annotation says: One interpretation is that "I alone" means that in this world, only I torment my heart and soul with such deep contemplation.

Ōnakatomi no Yoshinobu Ason
The fires lit
by the palace guards
who watch the sacred fence—
burning at night,
extinguished by day,
how they make me think of love.

The meaning of this poem: mikakimori refers to officials who light watch-fires in the imperial palace. Eji refers to the Palace Guards Bureau. The fires that these guards light burn only at night, representing painful yearning. Like the fires lit by the guards that burn at night, one should understand this by adding the character "night." ○ Genji says: Eji are samurai who serve under the Left Palace Guards. The Left Palace Guards protect the outer sacred fence. The meaning is that because I avoid being seen by others, during the day I am like extinguished fire, but at night I burn again. ○ Sōgi says: During the day represents a state where burning thoughts are calmed.

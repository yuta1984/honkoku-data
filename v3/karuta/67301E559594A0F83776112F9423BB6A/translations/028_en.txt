Fujiwara no Yoshitaka
For your sake,
this life I thought
I would not
regret losing—
now I wish
it could last
forever.

This poem is a "morning after" poem. While we were apart, I thought I would gladly trade my life for you, but it is because I have life that I was able to meet you like this. Now I find life even more precious. This is most deeply moving. The meaning is generally clear, but there is something worth noting in the phrase "omoi keru kana" (I have come to think). Given the intensity of loving someone, one should carefully observe how one's heart has come to wish for longevity. This "kana" is called "kaeru kana." Also, "nuru kana" expresses a past state of mind, while "keru kana" expresses present awareness. "Nagaku mo gana" is a phrase expressing a wish, like "may it be long."

Fujiwara no Sanekata Ason
I cannot even say
"it is thus"—
like the artemisia
of Mount Ibuki,
you will never know
how my love burns.

In this poem, "kaku to dani e ya wa ibuki" means that I cannot even say "my feelings are thus." "Iu" (to say) is played upon with "Ibuki." "Ibuki no sashimo-gusa" refers to artemisia that grows on Mount Ibuki in Ōmi Province. It is mentioned to allow the use of "sashimo" (so much). The meaning is: though my love burns like sashimo grass, because I cannot even say "it is thus," that person will never know how much—I desperately wish to let them know. ○ Kigin's annotation: This was composed based on poems that say "burning oneself with one's own thoughts" and "might my body be consumed."

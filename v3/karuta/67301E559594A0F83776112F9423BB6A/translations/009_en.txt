　Monk Henjō
Heavenly wind,
blow shut
the cloud pathways—
I would keep
the maiden's form
here for a while.

The heart of this poem is that if the wind blowing through the sky would close off the pathways through the clouds, he wishes to keep the maiden's figure there for a while to gaze upon. In the Kokin Wakashū, it says this was composed "upon seeing the Gosechi dance maidens." Since it was from his secular days, his name should be Munesada, but here Teika has listed it under Henjō. This poem likens the present dance maiden to the celestial maidens of old. Therefore, lamenting the end of the dance, he says "blow shut the cloud pathways." By saying "for a while," one can hear his heart knowing he cannot truly detain her. This is not about romantic feelings for the dance maiden, but rather about the beauty of the dance itself.

　Emperor Yōzei
From the peak
of Mount Tsukuba
falls
the Mina River—
love has accumulated
and become
a deep pool.

【Left page upper】
The heart of this poem is that no matter how great a river, its source begins as mere drops falling from beneath moss, gathering together until it eventually becomes an unfathomable river. Regarding love too, even though the glimpsed image of one's beloved was initially faint, when thoughts accumulate, it becomes an unbearable longing—this is the metaphor. Mount Tsukuba and the Mina River are both famous places in Hitachi Province, and this river is said to flow eastward into the Sakura River. This water flows from Mount Tsukuba, running beneath the sand invisibly, flowing in one course until it eventually becomes a river. This imperial poem is entirely a jo-ka (introductory poem).

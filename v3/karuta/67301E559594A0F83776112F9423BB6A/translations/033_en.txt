Koshikibu no Naishi
Mount Ōe—
the road through
Ikuno
is so distant
that I have not yet
even set foot
on Ama no
Hashidate

Regarding this poem, Koshikibu was the daughter of Izumi Shikibu. Mount Ōe, Ikuno—all are on the road to Hashidate. Hashidate is located in Tango Province. "Have not yet set foot" means have not yet gone to see it. It also includes the meaning of her mother's letters. At this time her mother was separated from her and living in Tango Province. This refers to when someone suspected that Koshikibu composed poems so well because her mother wrote them and sent them to her, so they pulled at Koshikibu's sleeve and said "At poetry competitions too, have the poems already come from Hashidate?" She composed this poem spontaneously in response.

Ise no Ōsuke
The double-petaled
cherry blossoms
of ancient
Nara,
the old capital—
today they bloom beautifully
in the nine-fold palace

【Left Page Top】
This poem was composed during the reign of Emperor Ichijō when someone brought double-petaled cherry blossoms from Nara. Since this court lady was present before His Majesty, he gave her the flowers and commanded her to compose a poem, so she composed this. The meaning is that the color and fragrance of the cherry blossoms from the ancient capital have become even more excellent now that they have come to this capital, with the double-petaled cherries blooming beautifully in the nine-fold palace. This is an impromptu expression of admiration, truly splendid. Playing on the fact that the imperial palace is called "nine-fold," she combines the color and fragrance of the cherries while also including the meaning "today, in this place."

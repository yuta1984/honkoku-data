Juntoku-in (Retired Emperor Juntoku)
At the hundred-mat palace,
even the shinobu ferns
growing on the old
eaves
cannot contain all
the memories of the past

The heart of this poem: "Momoshiki" refers to the imperial palace and the seats of the hundred court officials. "Old eaves" refers to the aged eaves of the great palace, containing the emperor's grief and thoughts about the decline of the imperial way. From "eaves" he composed "shinobu" (remembering/fern). Shinobu is the name of a fern that grows on eaves. He used this as a metaphor for remembering the past. "No matter how much I remember, there is still more to remember of the past"—he longs for the bygone era when the imperial way flourished. In seasonal notes, the word "shinobu" has different meanings: enduring patiently, hiding in secrecy, yearning in love—all have different nuances. Here "shinobu" means longing for the past.

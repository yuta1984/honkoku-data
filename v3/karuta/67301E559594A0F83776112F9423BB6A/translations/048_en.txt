In'pumon'in no Taifu
How I would like to show—
even the fishermen's sleeves
of the small islands,
though wet upon wet,
do not change color.

The meaning of this poem is that Kojima (Small Island) is a famous place. The fishermen's sleeves get wet upon wet, yet even so, their color does not change. But my sleeves, because of that cold-hearted person, have no respite from tears of blood, so they have changed to a crimson color. I would like to show this to that person. If they saw this, surely they would feel pity. ○ In Kigin's commentary: "My sleeves are not merely wet like those of the fishermen of the small islands, but have even changed color from tears of deep lament—I want to make known the intensity of my feelings."

Do crickets cry
on this frosty night's
rush mat
where I lay my robe
and sleep alone?

The meaning of this poem is: on a frosty night, spreading one's robe on a small mat, hearing the cry of crickets near the bed, continuing to think with loneliness, pity, and sadness—will I sleep alone through this night of lament? This expresses a heart deeply troubled by such thoughts. Truly, if one were to become that person, it would be elegantly moving and deeply pathetic. "Samushiro" is a narrow mat, with a play on words with "samu" (cold). "Koromo katashiki" means sleeping fully clothed without untying one's sash. Also, "kiri-girisu" refers to what is commonly called cricket (kōrogi).

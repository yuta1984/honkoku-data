Fujiwara no Kiyosuke Ason
If I live long,
will I again
fondly remember
these present days?
This world I saw
as painful
now seems dear to me.

The heart of this poem: If I continue to live long into the future, will I again fondly remember these current days that I find so melancholy? As I now yearn for the past world that I called painful and sad, I can imagine how things will be in the future as well—this expresses the lament that everything gradually declines and cannot match the past. ○Genshi says: The heart of this poem is clear. As one increasingly thinks of the past, even this present era that we find painful—will we not also long for it in times to come? This is a poem that resonates with everyone's heart. It is simply human nature to rely on a future that should not be relied upon.

Priest Shun'e
All through the night
when I am lost
in thought,
dawn will not come,
and even the gaps
in my bedroom walls
seem heartless.

The heart of this poem: On nights when I cannot sleep and am lost in thought, I wish at least for the night to end quickly, but unfortunately it drags on, and even the gaps in my bedroom walls seem heartless, as I wait and wait but dawn never comes. Sōgi says: The phrase "even the gaps in my bedroom walls" is remarkable, and shows how intense his feelings are. To resent what should not be resented, to find dear what should not be dear—this is the way of love's path. One should carefully contemplate the place where he laments "even the gaps in my bedroom walls."

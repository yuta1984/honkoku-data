Sone no Yoshitada
Crossing Yura Strait,
the boatman's
oar has broken—
not knowing where it leads,
this path of love.

The meaning of this poem is: though I have no reliable means to express my feelings of love, I cannot abandon these thoughts, and my accumulated feelings, like a boatman crossing Yura Strait who has lost his oar, have no known destination—this is expressed through this metaphor. Yura Strait is in Kii Province. Genji (Hosokawa Yūsai) says that this Yura Strait must be a place of rough waves. The meaning is that a ship crossing the great ocean without an oar would lose all reliable guidance. Like that ship, my path of love has no dependable support and no known direction.

Though eight-fold vines
grow thick
around this lonely
dwelling,
no people come to visit—
autumn has arrived.

The meaning of this poem is: yaemugura (eight-fold vines) is the name of a plant. Though this dwelling is overgrown with these thick vines, autumn unfailingly visits, but people never come at all. A vine-covered dwelling belongs entirely to autumn. ○ Sōgi says: Though the meaning is clearly understood, the former prosperity of Minister Tōru was like a dream, and the way this poem touchingly expresses the sentiment that only autumn, which never forgets the past, returns, is incomparably excellent. One should view this poem while deeply contemplating the past of Kawara-no-in. ○ Kigin's annotation: The meaning is that people surely do not come to this lonely vine-covered dwelling, and moreover, autumn has come.

Nyūdō Former Grand Minister (Nyūdō Saki no Daijō-daijin)
What the storm
scatters—not
the snow
in the garden
with flowers,
but my own body
grows old

【Right page top】
The heart of this poem: Though flowers may be scattered by storms and appear as snow in the garden, which one might not sweep away and could even admire, the aging that has come to my body is unavoidable and lamentable. With this sentiment, he composed "what falls is my own body." From saying "not snow" to "what falls," this is truly skillful and deeply moving.

Waiting for one
who does not come
at Matsuho
Bay
in the evening calm—
burning seaweed salt,
my heart too burns with longing

【Left page top】
The heart of this poem: Matsuho Bay is a famous place. He plays on "waiting (matsu) for one who does not come" and describes the time of evening calm at the pines (matsu). Then using "burning seaweed salt" as something from Matsuho Bay directly, he says "my heart burns too," comparing the intensity of his waiting thoughts to burning salt in the evening calm. Evening calm is a quiet evening time when the wind is still and does not blow. This lord must have had many poems, but this one was particularly selected for inclusion in this hundred poems collection.

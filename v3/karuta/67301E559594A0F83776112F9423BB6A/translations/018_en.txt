Mibu no Tadamine
Since that parting
when the dawn moon
appeared
so coldly indifferent,
nothing in this world
is as painful
as daybreak

【Right page upper】
The meaning of this poem is about someone who was visiting a lover, but that person was cold and would not meet him, so he returned feeling dissatisfied. The dawn moon remains coldly indifferent and night has broken, yet the pain of parting without meeting—from this comes the sentiment that nothing in the world is as painful as daybreak, and he is completely absorbed in this thought. This is about a love that, even when they meet, bears no fruit. There is a collection called Fusō Yōrinshū of about one hundred fascicles. It is a book in which Emperor Saga collected poems by this poet. In it, this is described as "love of returning without meeting." In other schools, it is "love of meeting and then parting." The meaning is clear in both commentaries.

Sakanoue no Korenori
At daybreak
so much like
the dawn
moon
they appeared—
the white snow
falling
in Yoshino village

【Left page upper】
The meaning of this poem is that at daybreak, looking at the grasses and trees of Mount Yoshino, the first snow has fallen thinly, appearing white like the light of the dawn moon. With the theme of first snow at a famous place, the meaning appears clearly. This poem was composed when he went down to Yamato Province and saw snow falling. Now "asaborake" (daybreak) is the time when night is breaking into dawn, and "asakatsu," "asarō," and "meikatsu" are all read as "asaborake." ○The seasonal commentary says: The moon at dawn has a faint light and is not particularly bright, so it can be mistaken for thinly falling snow.

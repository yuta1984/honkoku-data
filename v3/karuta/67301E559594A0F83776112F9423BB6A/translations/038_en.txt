Ryōzen Hōshi
In loneliness
I leave
my dwelling
and gaze out,
only to find
everywhere the same
autumn evening

【Right Page Top】
The heart of this poem is that wondering if the melancholy of autumn evening belongs only to his own dwelling, the poet steps outside to look, only to find that everywhere appears the same—thus he comes to understand even others' situations through inference. According to Genshi's commentary, "The meaning is generally clear. There should be particular significance in the phrase 'everywhere the same.' Thinking his own dwelling unbearably lonely and wishing to go anywhere else, when he steps out and gazes around, he finds that everywhere else is no different from his own heart." The seasonal commentary states: "Wondering if there might be some way to dispel this loneliness, he steps out from his dwelling, but since there is no dwelling other than autumn, an extremely difficult sentiment is revealed."

When evening comes,
the rice leaves
in the gate fields
rustle,
and autumn wind
blows through my reed hut

The heart of this poem describes how when evening comes, the autumn wind rises faintly and sways the rice leaves in the gate fields, then as autumn deepens, it sounds more strongly and the time comes when it blows roughly against the reed hut every evening. According to Hōin Genshi's commentary, "The 'reed hut' refers to something made entirely of reeds. The meaning is that one barely hears the autumn evening wind blowing gently through the rice leaves of the gate fields before it comes blowing to the reed hut—this captures that atmosphere."

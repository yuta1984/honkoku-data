Dainagon Kintō
Though the sound of the waterfall has ceased and long since passed away, its name still flows on and can be heard even now.

Number 55
The meaning of this poem is that it was composed upon seeing what was called the Waterfall Pavilion (Takidono) at Daigakuji Temple in Saga long ago. Even though that magnificently constructed Waterfall Pavilion has become a thing of the past, with its remains weathered and presenting a lonely appearance for quite some time now, the fact that its name alone is still transmitted to the present world and well known to people shows that it was truly a very famous place. "The name flows on" refers to how the name is transmitted to later generations, expressed through the metaphor of the waterfall's flow.

Hyakunin Isshu Picture Commentary, Volume One

【Main Text】
The meaning of this imperial poem is as follows: This emperor (Emperor Tenji) was deeply benevolent, and when he observed the autumn rice fields that had become sparse and desolate from the dew and frost of the temporary huts, he perceived the hardships of the common people. His imperial sentiment was: "Although I am reverently the sovereign who rules the realm, even my sleeves get wet with dew. How much more difficult must it be for those of humble station to make their living?" "Kariho no io" refers to the temporary huts used during rice harvesting.

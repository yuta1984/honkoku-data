Hyakunin Isshu Picture Commentary Volume Nine [Scroll Title Label]
[Scroll Main Text - Commentary]
The heart of this poem is as follows: I thought that when the flowers bloomed, I would become one with the flowers and be sought after by people, but while living in this world, I am busy with various affairs, and as I pass time distracted by this and that, the color of the first flowers of spring has faded even as I watched them in the long spring rains - such is the lamenting heart expressed here. "Nagame" is a word that combines both "long rain" and "gazing lost in thought."

[Karuta Upper Verse]
Ono no Komachi
The color of flowers
Has faded
Away, alas
In vain

[Karuta Lower Verse]
While my body
Lives in this world of
Long rains
During this time

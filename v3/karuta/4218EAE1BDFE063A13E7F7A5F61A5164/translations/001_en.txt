Juntoku-in (Emperor Juntoku)
At Momoshiki,
　the ancient
eaves
　of the
shinobu ferns
still cannot contain
　all the memories
　　of the past

　　Number 100
The heart of this poem expresses lamentation over the decline of the imperial way of governance. In these latter days, it is natural to long for the past. Moreover, since the imperial way has weakened, this concerns not just the sovereign's personal circumstances but the welfare of all people under heaven. Even when trying to remember the good old days, there is still too much to lament about the present pitiful state of the world. "Momoshiki" refers to the Imperial Palace where the hundred court officials take their seats.
"Shinobu" means to yearn for the past, and here it is combined with the shinobu fern plant.

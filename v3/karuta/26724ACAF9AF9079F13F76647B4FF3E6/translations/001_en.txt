Princess Shokushi (Shokushi Naishinnō)

O cord of life,
If you must break, then break!
For if I live on,
My power to endure in secret
May grow weak.

Number 88

The heart of this poem is that she has been suppressing her secret love, holding back her feelings again and again as the months and days pass. But if her life continues, her ability to keep this love secret will weaken, and eventually her feelings will be revealed, causing her distress. It would be better for her body to weaken and her life to end sooner than to face such suffering. "Tama no o" (cord of jewels) refers to life itself. "Taenaba taene" (if you must break, then break) are words spoken in desperation and resignation.

The expression "yowari mo zo suru" (may grow weak) is particularly interesting.

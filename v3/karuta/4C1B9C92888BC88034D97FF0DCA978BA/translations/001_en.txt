Senior Third Rank Karyū (Fujiwara no Ietaka)
The evening breeze
　　　rustling through the oaks
at Nara's brook—
　　　the purification ritual
is the only sign
　　that summer remains

The meaning of this poem is about the famous place called Nara Brook, where the purification ritual of the sixth month is performed. "The breeze rustling through the oaks" is expressed through imagery in the upper verse. It depicts a cool scene. Misogi refers to the purification ritual of the last day of the sixth month. Though today is still summer, the coolness and the appearance of the waterside are no different from autumn. Only the fact that this sixth-month purification ritual is being performed serves as a sign that it is still summer, the poet says.

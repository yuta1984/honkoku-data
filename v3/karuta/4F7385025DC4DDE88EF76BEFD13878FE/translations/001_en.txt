Mibu no Tadami
Though I say "love,"
　my reputation
has already
spread
　　too soon—
when I had only
　　secretly
　begun to
　　　　cherish these feelings

【Left Page: Poem Commentary】
The meaning of the poem on the right is: "Just when I have begun to feel affection for someone only yesterday or today, how quickly an unwelcome reputation has spread!" It means that I secretly began to think of that person without letting others know, but before I had even spoken these feelings aloud, people already knew and gave me a bad reputation. "Koisutefu" means "to be in love." "Madaki" means "too early" or "prematurely."

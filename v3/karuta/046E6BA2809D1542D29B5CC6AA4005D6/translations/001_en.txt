Former Great Monk Supervisor Gyōzon

Together with me,
Feel the pathos
Mountain cherry blossoms—
Other than these flowers
There is no one who knows me

Number 66

The meaning of this poem is as follows: When he entered Mount Ōmine, none of the plants and trees in this mountain were familiar to him, and feeling lonely, he stopped by a cherry tree in bloom and composed this poem. "There is no one else who knows me" means that in such a desolate mountain setting, there is nothing else worthy of admiration, and only the cherry blossoms are the same everywhere, so he feels as if he is meeting an old friend. The cherry blossoms, too, probably have no one closer to them than himself.

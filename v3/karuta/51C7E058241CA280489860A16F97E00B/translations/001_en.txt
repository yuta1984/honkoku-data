Yūshi Naishinnō-ke no Kii (Lady Kii of Princess Yūshi's Household)

I have heard tell
of Takashi Beach—
I will not let its fickle waves
splash upon my sleeves,
lest they become wet with tears.

Number 72

The meaning of this poem is that Takashi Beach is widely known throughout the world, famous for its reputation. "Ada nami" (fickle waves) refers to an unfaithful person. "Kakeji ya" means "I will not make a pledge" to such a well-known person. The heart of the poem—that if one makes a pledge with a fickle person, one will surely fall into melancholy—is expressed through "lest my sleeves become wet."

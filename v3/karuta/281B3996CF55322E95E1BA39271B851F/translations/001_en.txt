【Main Text】
The feeling of "rowing out to Wada Bay" is
deeply moving. Even ordinary people find sea voyages
lonely and sad,
let alone when one becomes an exile departing on
unfamiliar wave-paths—such inner feelings are beyond description.
"Wada no hara" refers to the ocean plain,
and "eighty islands" expresses the abundance of islands.
The sentiment of likening the boat to wild geese and asking
them to tell people back home
shows particularly deep emotion.

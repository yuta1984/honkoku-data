Hyakunin Isshu Illustrated Commentary, Number 37

【Scroll Main Text - Commentary】
The sentiment of this poem is as follows: the poet went to visit someone with whom he had exchanged poems, but that person was cold and would not meet him. As he departed and was returning home, he saw the moon at dawn and felt resentful. Even if one were returning after having met successfully, such a sky would be sorrowful, but how much more painful it is to return having been treated coldly. From this time onward, he could never forget this experience, and it seemed to him that nothing was as melancholy as the hours of dawn.

【Karuta Upper Verse】
Mibu no Tadamine
At dawn's light,
That seemed so cold
At our parting—

【Karuta Lower Verse】
Nothing is more
Sorrowful than daybreak

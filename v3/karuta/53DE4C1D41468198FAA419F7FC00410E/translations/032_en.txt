◯Pillow words (makura kotoba) and prefaces (jo) that do not relate to the meaning of the poems are omitted and not translated.

◯Where poems from the Man'yōshū have been incorporated here and there with altered particles, they are all translated according to the original Man'yōshū versions.

◯Regarding the writing style of this book: All translated words use katakana. What is written in hiragana beside the translations indicates which words in the poem correspond to the translation. Numbers are attached to each verse. Lines drawn to the side mark places where words not in the original poem have been added for explanation. Numbers like 1, 2, 3 in boxes indicate places where translations of the first verse, second verse, third verse, etc. have been omitted. Where "上" (upper) appears in a box, it refers to the upper verse. For more detailed matters, I defer to that work "Enkyō" (Distant Mirror), and since much has been omitted here, one should consult "Enkyō" to understand properly.

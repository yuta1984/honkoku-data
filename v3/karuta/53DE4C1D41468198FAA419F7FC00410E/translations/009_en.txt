○While it's natural to avoid people's eyes when actually visiting during the day, how strange it is
　　　that even in the path seen in dreams at night, one appears to avoid and shun people's watchful eyes

　　　From Shin-Kokinshū, Miscellaneous section, topic unknown　　　Ise
Even for the brief / space between the short reed / joints of Naniwa bay / must I pass through this world / without meeting you at all?
　　○Does this mean I must spend this life without meeting even for the brief moment
　　　between the short joints of reeds growing in Naniwa bay? What a truly cold-hearted person!

　　　From Goshūishū, Love section, sent to the Kyōgoku consort
　　　　　　　　after an incident occurred　　　Prince Motoyoshi
In my wretchedness / now it is all the same— / like Naniwa's marker / even if I lose my life / I long to meet with you
　　○Suffering in love and enduring hardships, now losing my life amounts to the same thing,
　　　so I think I will meet you even if it costs me my life

　　　From Kokinshū, Love section, topic unknown　　　Sōsei Hōshi
Just because you said / "I will come to you today" / through the long night of / the ninth month I waited out / even the dawn moon's rising
　　○Just because you sent word saying "I'll come to you right away," throughout this long night
　　　at the end of the ninth month, waiting and waiting, even the late dawn moon has already risen. Without even making
　　　a promise, I've waited out even the dawn moon, yet still the person I wait for truly does not come. What could be the matter?

　　　From Kokinshū, Autumn section, from a poetry contest at Prince Koresada's house　　Bunya no Yasuhide
Just from the blowing / autumn grasses and trees wilt / so naturally one / calls the mountain wind a / "storm" that "lays waste" [arashi]
　　○Since autumn grasses and trees wither just from the wind blowing, it's quite natural.
　　　That's why they call the mountain wind "arashi" (storm)

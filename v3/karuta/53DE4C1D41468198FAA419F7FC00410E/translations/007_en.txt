Counselor Takamura
Over the vast sea / crossing eighty islands / I row into exile / tell this to people back home / you fishermen's boats
　　○Tell the people in my homeland that I have now set sail onto the seas where I will pass
　　　countless islands one after another on my journey. You fishing boats of the fishermen
　　　who are returning to those parts, please carry this message

　　　From Kokinshū, Miscellaneous section, composed upon seeing court dancers at the Gosechi festival　Priest-Premier Henjō
Heavenly wind blow / and close the path through the clouds / that the maiden takes / so her graceful dancing form / may linger here a while
　　○That heavenly maiden's dance is so fascinating and I'm reluctant to see it end. O wind that blows through the sky,
　　　please blow shut the path through the clouds by which that heavenly maiden would return to heaven,
　　　so that I may keep her here a while longer and watch more of her dance

　　　From Gosenshū, Love section, sent to Prince Tsuridono
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Emperor Yōzei  
From Tsukuba's peak / the Minano River flows / like my growing love / that deepens as it goes / into a bottomless pool
　　○Like the small amount of water falling from Mount Tsukuba's peak that eventually
　　　becomes the deep Minano River below, so too does love gradually accumulate
　　　and deepen like a river pool

　　　From Kokinshū, Love section, topic unknown　　　Minister of the Left Kawara
Michinoku's / patterned silk of Shinobu— / for whose sake should I / let my heart be disturbed? / There is no one but you
　　○For whose sake would I scatter my heart elsewhere? I am not one who would
　　　scatter my heart to anyone other than you

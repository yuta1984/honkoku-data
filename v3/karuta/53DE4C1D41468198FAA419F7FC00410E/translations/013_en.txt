○As for people, I don't know whether their hearts remain unchanged or have changed, but at this familiar lodging, the plum blossoms, well, when I came, they smell just the same as they did before.

From Kokinshū, Summer section, composed at dawn on a night when the moon was particularly beautiful　　　Kiyohara no Fukayabu
The summer night / ended while still / seeming like early evening / In which of the clouds / does the moon now dwell?

○Ah, it was such a beautiful moon, but the summer night is so short that it ended quickly while it still seemed like early evening, without even time for the night to deepen. With such a short night, the moon probably didn't have time to reach the western mountains—I wonder in which of those dawn clouds it has taken shelter.

From Gosenshū, Autumn section, composed when poetry was requested during the Engi era　　　Bunya no Asayasu
In autumn fields / where white dew lies / and wind blows constantly / jewels that cannot be / strung together scatter

○When the wind blows constantly over the white dew that has settled on the grass leaves of the autumn fields, unstrung jewels scatter with a rustling sound.

From Yamato Monogatari, sent after a man who had sworn by all manner of things that he would not forget, but then did forget　　　Ukon
I do not grieve / for my forgotten self / but precious indeed / is the life of him / who made those promises

○I don't care what becomes of my forgotten self, but the life of the man who swore he would not forget me will likely be lost—how precious that is!

From Gosenshū, Love section, sent to someone　　　Sangi Hitoshi
Though I try to hide / my feelings in the fields / of sparse miscanthus / why do they overflow / making me long for you so?

○Though I try to conceal it, my feelings overflow and I long for that person—why is this so?

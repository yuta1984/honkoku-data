The heart of this poem: This was composed when the poet was secretly in love with someone, but their relationship was discovered, and they could no longer meet in secret.
Since meeting is out of the question, and they cannot even exchange a single word, now they can only yearn with longing. Their feelings grow ever more intense, and their spirit and heart seem ready to expire. They wish there were some way to meet their beloved just once, not through an intermediary, and tell them directly with their own voice. This is a deeply moving poem.

Now there is only
　"My thoughts will
　　cease to be"—
If only I could say
Just this much to you
Not through another
　But in some direct way

Fujiwara no Yoshitaka

For your sake
I thought my life
not worth preserving—
yet now I wish
it could last forever

The sentiment of the poem on the right is as follows: "If I could meet you just once, I wouldn't regret losing this life as fragile as dew, I wouldn't mind dying"—such were my thoughts. But after meeting you and parting, the pain of separation was so intense that my former feelings transformed completely. Now I only wish for my life to be long so that I may be bound to you forever. This is indeed a deeply moving poem.

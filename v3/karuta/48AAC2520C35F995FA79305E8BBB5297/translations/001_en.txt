Former Chief Abbot Jien

Not presumptuously,
I spread over
the people of this troubled world
my ink-dyed sleeves
from the mountain forest
where I dwell

Number 95

The meaning of this poem: "Not presumptuously" means "not beyond my station." "The mountain forest where I dwell" refers to Mount Hiei. Living on this mountain, I would like to care for all the people of the world like my own children and shelter them with my sleeves, as a practitioner of the Lotus Sutra should. However, someone inadequate like myself can only dwell here as a mere resident of this mountain.

This is a poem composed through earnest self-reflection.

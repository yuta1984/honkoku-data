Imperial Dowager's Palace Chief (Kōtaigōgū no Taifu) Shunzei

In this world
There is no path of escape
Even when I retreat
Into the deep mountains
The deer cry there too

Number Eighty-Two

The heart of this poem is that having taken to heart all the various sorrows of this world, thinking now that all the painful things of this bitter world are unnecessary, if one resolves to go even to the depths of deep mountains, there too the deer cry with melancholy voices. Hearing this, one realizes that even in the mountain depths there are sorrows of the world. In any case, there is no path by which to escape from this world - such is the lamenting heart.

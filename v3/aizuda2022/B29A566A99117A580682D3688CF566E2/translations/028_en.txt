[They would] conduct an investigation, so [he should] keep this in mind. Regarding this matter, [they] said they would convey [the decision] after consulting with Lord Matsudaira Izu-no-kami. From then on, a strict investigation began, and [he] appeared several times. In the seventh month, eight people were summoned: Hirokawa Rikishirō, Irie Kuemon, Nakane Gengoemon, Tsuchiya Katsugo, Saka Jūrozaemon, Kajiwara Yūzaburō, Yokoyama Kazuma, and Takahashi Banemon. I wished to write down my thoughts and bring them to Lord Yagyū for submission, so I inquired in writing about how to proceed with this matter. The instruction was that it would be best to consult privately with the trusted officials and obtain their guidance before submitting. Following this guidance, I visited the trusted group of officials and received instruction from each. The content of the written statement was: regarding this investigation, many people have been summoned from the countryside, which is indeed awe-inspiring. However, at this time when our lord's name is [associated with] youth, the fact that many have been summoned from the home domain may create unease even if neighboring domains hear of it. The senior retainers are also greatly concerned about this matter. Regarding the inquiries directed at those in positions of responsibility, I am fully aware of all such matters and will naturally provide answers to each inquiry. Among the aforementioned individuals, there are matters where inadequate handling has been quite reasonably pointed out.

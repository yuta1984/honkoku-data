received the talisman, and since tonight was Setsubun (the seasonal division), during our worship there was a Shinto ritual, and the voices chanting the demon-expelling soybean purification ceremony echoed throughout the sacred mountain, penetrating deeply into our souls. This morning was particularly severely cold, yet the young lord did not show any displeasure and graciously saw us off. Thinking that there would be no opportunity to appear before him again and pay our respects, while a warrior's reputation is not uncommon, this was truly a matter that moved us to profound emotion.

- On February 2nd of the same year, we arrived at Aomori in Tsugaru domain, but even now no ships for sea crossing have come around, and there is no way to cross the sea even if we conduct maneuvers from here. Moreover, due to lodging difficulties and other issues, we are unavoidably staying in the same place and making every effort to arrange for hiring passage ships.
　　　However, since Aizu is far from the seacoast and we are unfamiliar with handling ship rentals, after making our appeal, the government officials are supposed to hire merchant ships from the Osaka and Hyogo areas in the form of official government vessels and have them go around to various locations. Understanding that once they arrive in our domain we would be able to cross the sea without delay, we arrived at this place according to schedule. However, not only the ships from the Osaka area, but even ships that approach nearby areas are, as is usual at this time of year, still in winter storage without even being launched, and it is said that navigation in the northern seas is impossible during the particularly cold period.

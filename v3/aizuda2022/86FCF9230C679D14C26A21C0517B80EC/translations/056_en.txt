They gradually loaded cargo in haste, stowing extra rice, firewood, and water, deploying cannons on the ships, and preparing vessels so they could depart at any moment. Since the 8th was already the eighty-eighth night after the beginning of spring, they had been waiting daily for favorable winds. This morning the wind conditions became favorable. Beginning with Kitahara Uneme's group stationed in Karafuto, along with Hinata Saburoemon's prepared unit, they boarded five vessels {{marginal note: 1,300-koku capacity Jizaimaru from Hyogo, Shibaya Chōdayū's ship under official construction, Magistrate Kajiwara Saemon and his subordinates also boarding}} and placed lookouts on the towers to guard against unforeseen circumstances. Together with Acting Inspector Yamaoka Denjūrō and other officials and crew, they all set sail. {{marginal note: The second group with leader Kitahara Gundayū and Arms Magistrate Tōyama Sandayū had no ship and remained in Matsumae, departing on the 28th, arriving on May 12th and 19th}} With favorable winds, on the evening of the 18th they saw Riishiri-Shiranushi to the left, crossed over 300 ri of ocean without delay, and approached the lord's territory during the night. However, since enemy movements were unclear and landing in darkness carried incalculable risks of unexpected trouble, they first anchored offshore, then landed at Kushunkotан before noon on the 19th. When they immediately consulted with the officials about all matters, it was arranged that temporary shelters would be provided by the official administration until permanent camp facilities could be constructed. For these arrangements, Survey Officer Arai Heibei had departed Matsumae on March 17th, but since he traveled by small boat along the coast, he only arrived on May 7th. Survey Officer Mogami Tokunai had also just arrived here yesterday, the 18th, from Shiranushi, so no shelters had been prepared, and they hastily erected temporary shelters themselves for the time being.

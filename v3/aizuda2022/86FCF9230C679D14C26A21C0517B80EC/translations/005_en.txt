Kantarō Yoshimune served under Mōri Kawachi-no-kami Hideyori,
　　the lord of Ina in Shinshū Province. After Kawachi-dono's death, due to certain circumstances, he left the Mōri family
　　and never served two lords in his lifetime. He lodged with his elder brother Riemon Kazuyoshi
　　and died in Hiroshima, Geishū Province on the 19th day of the 2nd month of Genna 6, year of the monkey (1620).
　　His Buddhist name was Shunpō Sōha Anju, later changed to Shinto with spirit
　　name Shisō Reisha.
One　In the 4th month of Kan'ei 16, year of the rabbit (1639), he was granted a fief of 300 koku
　　and summoned to serve in Edo as an outside vassal (tozama)
　　　This summons came through the recommendation of Nakane Ikino-kami Masamori. Ikino-kami's
　　　wife was of the Ōhashi clan and was related to Kanemon as his aunt
One　In the same 19th year, year of the horse (1642), he was appointed to the messenger service (goshiyaku) and granted an additional 200 koku
One　In the same 20th year, year of the sheep (1643), due to the transfer to Aizu, he served in
　　the castle handover duties
　　　Since he performed the handover duties without incident, he should have received
　　　the standard stipend increase like everyone else, but the details are unclear.
　　　Perhaps 100 koku were granted in two separate occasions in recent years, but this was mistakenly
　　　recorded as 200 koku being granted last year. In the 3rd month of Kanbun 11,
　　　year of the boar (1671), during the fire at Akai-machi, the rapid spread of fire caused
　　　the burning of various record books, so the details remain unknown

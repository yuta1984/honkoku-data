However, we hear that your illness is not ordinary, and it must surely be difficult for you. Nevertheless, please continue to recuperate slowly, and when you feel even slightly better, regardless of your condition, please resume your duties. Until then, please handle official business from your home." Such was His Lordship's intention. Therefore, no matter what petition you might submit at this time, it will not be granted. Various kind words expressing His Lordship's considerate thoughts were spoken.

Around that time, sea crossings would not be possible - this is heard without doubt. Regarding the matter of arriving at that place after mid-January, it does not necessarily appear that the Senior Councilors deliberated thoroughly before issuing their directive. In any case, concerning the initial directive, since there would be obstacles on the roads while the snow is deep afterward, a directive was immediately issued that [forces] should be dispatched from the home domain around the time when the snow melts and passages open. Although there were consultations about the timing of arrival at assigned positions, even to that extent there was no definite directive. There was a directive that those stationed at Matsumae should arrive around mid-March, but the timing for arriving at Karafuto and Soya could not be determined. Regarding the matter that Ezo rebels must not cross over and invade before our gradual successive arrivals, we consulted earnestly with Inspector Katamine Hosuke, Quarters Officer Yokoyama Kazuma, and Nomura Chuujiro and made various arrangements, but since it was not yet the season for sea crossings, things did not proceed as intended, causing bewilderment. We sent detailed reports of the situation during the journey to Gensuke's and Uneme's parties, and there were also matters reported from their side. While we were pressing forward with all our might, on the fourteenth of the same month Gensuke's party arrived at this place. On the fifteenth of the same month, Matsumae Magistrate Muragaki Awaji-no-kami arrived at this place and took lodging. We went to the inn to meet with him and reported the previous circumstances one by one. He acknowledged everything and accepted that our concerns were unavoidable, instructing us in various ways to continue making arrangements without negligence.

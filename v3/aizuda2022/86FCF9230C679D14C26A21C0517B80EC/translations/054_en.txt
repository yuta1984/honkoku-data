"fault, and this matter is entirely our responsibility, and it will certainly not bring dishonor to your house. I will definitely state this clearly." This is what we were told.

During our stay at Minmaya, Survey Officer Yoshimi Senzaburō treated us with great kindness, secretly lending us books that would serve as guides for Ezo, and showing us exceptional consideration. Therefore, when we consulted with him about various ship arrangements, he informed us that "all ships departed from Osaka by early January" and that notifications had been completed to the Edo office, but maritime affairs do not go according to plan. Such was the situation, and indeed everything seemed beyond our control.

On the 29th of the same month, all personnel assigned to Karafuto Sōya crossed over to Matsumae, and our unit moved to take position at Kyōzan Keikyu-in.

However, we kept sending word to Gensuke's group and Uneme's group about ships gradually arriving, and they also sent word that there were delays. Having reached the limit of our patience, we engaged in various extraordinary negotiations. On the 19th of this month, we gathered everyone from the villages near Minmaya, including up to Imabetsu, to Gensuke's position, with about three or four people per tsubo in conditions similar to sleeping outdoors—truly an unreasonable situation. But if we do not cross with the next favorable wind, it will already be late March and the timing will be too late. Therefore, in extreme urgency, everyone has loaded even their essential equipment and is waiting for favorable winds.

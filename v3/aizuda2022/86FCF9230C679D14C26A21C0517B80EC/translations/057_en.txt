In the vicinity of this location, there is no level ground. Although there are small flat areas in valleys and such, they are low and marshy with severe irregularities, covered entirely with thorns and brambles, making immediate construction impossible even for temporary sites. From about ten ken above the shoreline where waves break, it continues into mountains, with no suitable locations at all. Though it is an exposed place close to the water's edge where enemy ships can see across - a very unfavorable location - there was no choice. They cleared away the ashes from the trading post and warehouses that the Ezo had burned down two years ago, made it into a temporary camp, strung ropes to mark the boundaries of each unit's area, and established camp gates. For shelter materials, they cut timber from the mountain forests and erected round huts using paulownia wood, oil, and boat moss to barely shield against rain and dew. They unpacked and spread out Ryukyu mats that had been bundled for transport, arranged armor and weapons alongside, and made various preparations so that defensive arrangements would not be hindered. Since the arrival of foreign raiders could not be predicted, they immediately began extensively surveying the local geography and the advantages and disadvantages for offense and defense, establishing procedures to avoid confusion when the enemy arrived.

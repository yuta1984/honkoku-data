1. In Jōkyō 1st year, year of the Rat, 7th month, regarding Gunshichirō, younger brother of Ikegami Kyūgorō of Hori Hanemon's group, when a request was made to adopt him as the son of Yajima Shichibee, an ashigaru-kogashira (foot soldier squad leader), it was determined that there was no precedent for granting permission for adoption of stipend rice recipients, so further investigation was needed, and Kyūgorō's written petition was returned.

In the 2nd year, year of the Ox, 7th month, Gunshichirō, younger brother of Ikegami Kyūgorō, who had been sent as an adopted son to okachi-kogashira (foot soldier leader) Yajima Shichibee's household since the previous year, absconded on the 9th day of this month, as reported.

Also, in Genroku 6th year, year of the Rooster, 11th month, regarding Gunshichirō, younger brother of Ikegami Kyūgorō, who had absconded nine years earlier, since his adoptive father Yajima Shichibee had no objections, permission was granted for his return to the domain as requested.

The above is recorded in the official records, but since neither family has any oral tradition of these events, the contents of the official records are noted here.

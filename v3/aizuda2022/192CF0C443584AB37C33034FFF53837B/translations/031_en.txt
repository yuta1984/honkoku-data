were called, but around the middle period they changed to Hoshina for the following reasons. Initially,
　　　Hoshina Tarō Masaharu served under
　　　the Kamakura Genji shogunate, but after the Kamakura governance passed to the Hōjō family,
　　　the Hoshina clan fell into decline and came to
　　　Fujisawa in Shinano Province, where they sought the protection of the Fujisawa clan. Regarding the dates, this Hoshina
　　　claimed to be descendants of the distinguished Genji family, and it was during the time of grandfather Kuranonjō
　　　《Buddhist name: Dōun, grave located outside the temple grounds at Takato in Shinano Province》that they changed from Fujisawa back to Hoshina.
　　　His son Hachirōzaemon《Buddhist name and burial place unknown》
　　　【Original note: took as wife the daughter of Sakai Seizaemon】
　　　had one daughter and four sons. The daughter married Hijikata Matauemon,
　　　the eldest son Gennonjō spent his entire life
　　　as a masterless samurai (rōnin), the second son was Sakuzaemon, and the third and fourth sons are
　　　recorded in the genealogy.
　　　Initially he served Takeda Shingen, then later
　　　served Dōgi-sama (Hoshina Masamitsu). During the Winter Siege of Osaka,
　　　he was stationed at his fief in Fujisawa on the border between Suwa and Matsumoto, but since his son was young, his son-in-law Yoshikawa
　　　Ichinonjō served as Sakuzaemon's substitute,
　　　accompanying Dōgi-sama to the Osaka front and
　　　fulfilling his duties there.
一　《Date unknown》At Takato in Shinano Province, he was granted a fief of 150 koku

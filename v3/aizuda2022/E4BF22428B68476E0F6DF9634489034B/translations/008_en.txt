The descendants of Masashige served the Mito household, but Masashige's grandson, Hannoemon Noritō, died of illness at age twenty-one on the 4th day of the 4th month of Genroku 9 (1696), and since he had no heir, the family line was discontinued. The eldest son, Magoemon Masamichi, served the Torii family like his father, receiving a stipend of 400 koku and serving as a monogashira (military officer). However, when Sakyōnosuke Tadatsune died young in Kan'ei 13 (1636) without an heir and the family was discontinued, he became a masterless samurai. In the 8th month of the same year, Lord Dotsū (Hoshina Masayuki) took control of the domain, and in the 9th month of the same year, he was summoned back with his previous stipend restored.

1. In the 9th month of Kan'ei 13 (1636), at Mogami in Dewa Province, he was granted the same stipend of 400 koku as before, summoned to service, and appointed as monogashira.

2. In the 8th month of Kan'ei 20 (1643), when the lord relocated to Aizu, he accompanied him and was granted a standard increase of 100 koku.

3. In the 5th month of Keian 4 (1651), when Lord Daikōin (Tokugawa Iemitsu) passed away, he was ordered to oversee construction work at Nikkō, so he went there and performed his duties.

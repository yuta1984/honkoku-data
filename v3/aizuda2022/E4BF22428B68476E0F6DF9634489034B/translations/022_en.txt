- In the 12th month of An'ei 1 (1772), regarding the matter of Ōtake Kichijirō:
　　　He had been residing in a town house for several years, and during the absence of the family of Inoue Kintadayū, with whom he had been closely associated, someone unknown broke the lock at the entrance and stole bedding. This bedding was pawned at Chōuemon's place in Muitchō, but during the investigation he gave unsatisfactory explanations. Furthermore, at the residence of village headman Shirōzaemon in Akai village of Hara group, regarding a short sword that Shinaemon had stolen from Tanaka Kumaemon (who guards the bypass road in Sasayama village of the same group) in previous years, which was also deposited at Mohēji's place in Gyōninmachi as collateral for a loan - when Shinaemon learned it was stolen goods and sent someone to negotiate its return, this was not a matter that could be overlooked casually, but upon investigation, he claimed these were matters not worth addressing. Both of these charges were inexcusable

They built a small castle in Takamine village, Koka district, Omi Province, and resided there. Therefore, they took the place name "Takamine" as their family name. They controlled Takamine village, Komaki village, and various other places, governing their main domain of 1,500 koku. When Lord Oda Nobunaga went to Kyoto, they first served under Nobunaga, and later served under Lord Toyotomi Hideyoshi. However, they incurred his displeasure and became ronin (masterless samurai). Subsequently, they served under Tsutsui Iga-no-kami, controlling a domain of 1,000 koku and serving as a group leader of twenty-five mounted warriors. Munekiyo's eldest son was called Shinemon-no-jo Muneaki.

In the second year of Keicho (1597), when Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu ordered Kagatsume Hayato to summon warriors who had recently been living in hiding in Koka district, Omi Province, Muneaki was also summoned and granted relief rice. In the fifth year of the same era (1600), during the campaign against Uesugi Kagekatsu, at the request of Yamaoka Doami, he had an audience at Fushimi Castle and was granted a stipend. At this time, he was told to return to Koka. However, when news of Ishida Mitsunari's rebellion arrived, though there were no specific orders, he gathered local warriors and fortified himself in the Nagoya-maru of Fushimi Castle, exerting himself to the utmost.

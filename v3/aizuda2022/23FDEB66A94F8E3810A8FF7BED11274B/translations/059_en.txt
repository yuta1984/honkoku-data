When inquiring repeatedly about the procedures for managing the outer quarters, it was reported that detailed matters could not be adequately handled, so from that time until the next attendance in Edo, he was appointed to serve as an attendant to the lord's private quarters and was ordered to serve under the direction of the private quarters officer.

1. In the same month, although he had been appointed to concurrently serve as timekeeper and candle officer, since this appointment to private quarters service would make it difficult to manage both duties, he was relieved of the concurrent appointment. However, since it would be difficult to completely withdraw for the time being, he was ordered to also report to the timekeeper's office when his main duties permitted and to continue managing cost-saving measures as before.

1. In the 12th month of the same year, while both his main and concurrent duties were numerous, he served diligently and thoroughly in all matters, so as a special consideration he was granted 2 bu of certificate gold as a role stipend.

1. In the same month, while he had been appointed to serve as private quarters attendant until the following spring, due to his attentive and diligent service in various matters, he was privately granted 300 hiki of gold by Lord Sadaaki.

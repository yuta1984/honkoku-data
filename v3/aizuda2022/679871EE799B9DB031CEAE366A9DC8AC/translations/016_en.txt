For generations [the family] served the Torii house, and during the time of Sakyō Tadamasa received a stipend of 150 koku, but became masterless samurai (rōnin) when the Torii house had its domain reduced.

1. In the 9th month of Kan'ei 13 (1636), year of the rat, [he] was summoned at Mogami, granted a stipend of 150 koku as before under the previous lord, and was appointed to the outside retainer group (togai-yama-gumi).
　However, regarding which group's ancestor [he was], there is no family tradition, but it appears [he belonged to] Ibuka Kenmotsu's group. In the guard duty of Shōhō 4 (1647), he served under Kenmotsu, and in Jōō 2 (1653) he served under his son Moemon. In this group, Kenmotsu's successor was his son Moemon, and his successor was Ibuka Shirōbē. However, during his son Shirōzaemon's succession ceremony, it appears to have been Shirōbē's group, so it is clearly evident that he continued in the same group from Kenmotsu's time. Therefore, during the domain transfer to Aizu in Kan'ei 20 (1643), he also belonged to Kenmotsu's group and went to Aizu in advance, likely performing castle guard duty from before the lord's formal entry.

1. In the same year <<month unknown>>, he was appointed to the position of deputy magistrate (daikan) and served for three years.

1. In the same 16th year, year of the rabbit, he performed official service at Taira.

Regrettably, the troubles of the heir lord were severe, so Hoyu (Kato Hoyu) spoke to Lord Genji. The lord said, "Seigen has no personal motives in his official duties. I know this well. I did not expect his reputation to reach such heights." Lord Inaba Mino no Kami also lamented and regretted this, the same as Lord Sakai.

Seigen had no son, and prior to this, the lord had commanded him to establish an heir, but he declined, saying, "I, your retainer, have no achievements yet receive generous stipend, and to pass this on would not be in accordance with my will." The lord understood this and followed his words.

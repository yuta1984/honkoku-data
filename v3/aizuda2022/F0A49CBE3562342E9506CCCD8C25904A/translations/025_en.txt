1. In the 8th month of Bunka 8 (1811), he was appointed to serve as a hired retainer (goyō) of external status in Sagami Province, where he was granted a stipend of three persons' worth of rice and given an interest-free loan of five ryō each as expense supplement, as officially announced.
1. In the 9th month of the same year, although he was appointed to serve as a hired external retainer in Sagami Province, he had previously traveled repeatedly to Miharu territory with permission to train in Ichinomiya-ryū sword techniques, and gradually acquired disciples here as well. However, since his disciples recently reported that there was no one else who could substitute for him when he was absent from the training hall, he was granted special exemption from the aforementioned hired service and was ordered to remain here to train his disciples.

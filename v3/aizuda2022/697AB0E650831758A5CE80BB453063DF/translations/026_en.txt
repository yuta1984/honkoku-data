　　　Although it had been previously announced that those who do not continue their father's profession should be given other positions, since he had been granted leave and sent to another domain in previous years and was only recently brought back, there was no time for him to receive instruction in the family profession. Moreover, since Chisoku (Shigetsugu) performed medical treatment both internally and externally well, this appointment was made as a special favor.

一　In the 3rd month of the 3rd year, Year of the Snake, he went up to Edo for guard duty rotation and returned in the 9th month of the same year.

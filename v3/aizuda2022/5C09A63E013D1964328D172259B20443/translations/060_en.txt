Regarding the above grant, based on Sasahara Gen'nosuke's service, he should have been appointed to the martial arts instruction position as well, but he had been unwell for a long time and had been forcing himself to serve until now. However, since he was a person familiar with the duties, and with the lord's consideration that he should serve for a long time, it was proclaimed through the retainer that for the time being he should focus on recuperation and attend in the morning, but depending on official duties, he could also attend and serve all day.

While serving the Katō family, when they were transferred to Iwami Province, he became a rōnin (masterless samurai).

By Lord Hoshina's will: "Since Hanemon has become a rōnin in his old age, he will be in even greater distress, so we should take him in and provide him with a small rice stipend," this was proclaimed through Goroemon. He moved directly from the Katō residence to the Shiba residence, and was subsequently granted one gold piece and a four-person rice stipend.

When he was assigned to serve Lord Iwahiko, since he had served in the women's quarters at the Katō house and was knowledgeable about household management, he was ordered to enter the women's quarters without reserve, inspect the lord's quarters, and report any damages that might be found. He served faithfully until his extreme old age.

In reality, it was reported that Heijirō had returned on the night of the 4th, and furthermore, of the money borrowed from Heijirō's side, money that had been used for external transactions was also directed to Umon's private affairs. Given that there have been various evasive explanations up to this point, and considering Heijirō's disturbed mental state as recorded in the documents, there arose unavoidable suspicion that this was a scheme targeting the money in Heijirō's possession.

　　　This behavior being unbecoming of a samurai and extremely inappropriate, he was granted leave and ordered to retire from the domain.

One: In the 11th month of Kansei 4 (1792), year of the Rat, he was appointed to oversee the sale of domestically produced aloe oil.

One: On the 22nd day, 12th month of Bunka 5 (1808), year of the Dragon, he died of illness at age fifty. Buddhist name: Shinan Heikyū Koji. Burial site: same as above.

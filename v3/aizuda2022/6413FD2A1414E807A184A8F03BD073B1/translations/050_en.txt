At age 16, he served Gamō Ujisato. During the Korean campaign, due to certain circumstances, he crossed over to that land and studied the art of horsemanship (sōma no jutsu), mastering its secret techniques before returning to Japan. However, the Gamō family had already been transferred to Iyo Province, so he served Lord Tadateru of Echigo and was granted a domain of 1,000 koku. After Lord Tadateru's death, he was summoned by Nanryūin-sama of Kii Province, where he was granted the same 1,000 koku as under his previous lord and served faithfully. From Nanryūin-sama, he received a crested kozuka (small utility knife) and a kozuka made by Yūjō. Later, due to certain circumstances, he left service with the Kii house and lived as a rōnin in Edo.

Lord Hoshina Masayuki (Dotsū-sama) heard of this and summoned him to his presence many times. He died of illness in Kanbun 9 (1669), year of the rooster, at age 97. His posthumous Buddhist name was Kōyo Seizan Koji, and he was buried at Saiōji Temple in Kanasugi, Musashi Province.

1. In Kan'ei 20 (1643), year of the sheep, 7th month, at the time of the lord's entry into Aizu domain, although he was to be summoned at the lord's residence, he was ordered in Edo to go ahead first, and thus went down to Aizu.
　Note: Previously, while residing in Edo, both father and son were summoned many times to the presence of Dotsū-sama.

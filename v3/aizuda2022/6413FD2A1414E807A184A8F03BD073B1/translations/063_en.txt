Regarding the matter of frequently reporting and making efforts concerning His Lordship's learning of horsemanship, by His Lordship's decision, he was granted sake and two sets of horse reins.

However, he was granted various gifts on multiple occasions.

In the same month, as he frequently attended Lord Ryōtokuin's equestrian training and served as his partner, His Lordship granted him one bundle of cotton.

However, he was granted such gifts repeatedly thereafter.

In the same month, when he attended the residences of Lord Matsujuin and Lord Renjuin, it was announced that they were greatly pleased with his efforts, and he was granted various gifts.

However, thereafter he was frequently granted gifts from both Their Lordships.

In the 10th month of the same year, he took the lead in managing cost-saving measures for various construction projects at residences under the lord's direct administration, as well as the kitchen, tea ceremony department, bird-keeping department, gardens, attendant quarters, and reception areas. When he had suggestions, he consulted with the relevant departments and reported to the chief retainer for the lord's benefit.

1. In the 12th month of An'ei 4 (1775, Year of the Sheep): As requested, he was relieved of his concurrent duty as district magistrate and returned to serving castle guard duty.
　　However, regarding his resignation request: although he claimed no particular illness, his administrative district was in dire straits, and due to poor harvests, tax collection and all administrative matters seemed to face difficulties with no prospects for improvement. Since investigations were still incomplete and it was unclear when current tax levies and collections could be determined, this was indeed a time requiring collective effort. Even if inadequate, he should have devoted himself wholeheartedly to tax collection efforts. Yet at this crucial time for tax collection, despite claiming illness, his request for resignation was deemed highly inappropriate by his lord. He was ordered to be reprimanded for this matter.

1. In the 6th month of the same 6th year (1777, Year of the Rooster): He was again appointed to concurrently serve as district magistrate.

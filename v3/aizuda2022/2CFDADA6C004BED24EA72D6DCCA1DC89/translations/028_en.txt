1. Regarding the actual father Tazaemon: In Keichō 18, year of the ox, 3rd month, 2nd day, when Dotsusama was three years old and was adopted as a foster child by Kenshōin-sama, [Tazaemon] together with Ariizumi Gohee went to greet [them] and served as attendant. On the following day, the morning of the 3rd day festival, he was summoned before Kenshōin-sama, Jōkōin-sama, and Dotsusama. Kenshōin-sama's words were: "All the men and women in my personal service shall serve Dotsusama without exception. Among them, Tazaemon in particular shall be sent to Dotsusama from today. Furthermore, he may be employed with confidence for the needs of Jōkōin-sama and Omekubun-sama. For this purpose, he is specially designated and sent. When Dotsusama comes of age, he will surely not act improperly, so [Tazaemon] should serve diligently." This was commanded.

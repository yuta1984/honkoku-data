This vapor accumulates and seeks to escape, but having no outlet, it creates tremors with its force and shakes the great earth. This is what we call an earthquake.

Both steam cars and steam ships operate by steaming just a small amount of water and running on the force of the vapor that blows out, yet they are truly astonishing to behold. When we consider this principle, it becomes clear that when the great quantity of water that has leaked underground is steamed into vapor, it would be extremely easy for it to blow apart this world. However, as mentioned before, Heaven has created volcanoes in various places to allow this vapor to escape, so such disasters are rare. ○ Now, there are various types of earthquakes - some move from side to side, others move up and down

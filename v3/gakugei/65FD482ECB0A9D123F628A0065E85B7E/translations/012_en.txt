such is its form.
Also, hail occurs when water vapor that has evaporated and risen into the air condenses due to cold air to become rain, but if during its descent from above the cold air is exceptionally severe, those raindrops freeze and become hail. If there is still water vapor during the descent, it can attach to the hail and form large masses. These large

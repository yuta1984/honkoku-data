It accumulates on the leaves of plants and trees, moistening them and preventing them from withering. ○ Dew is abundant in spring and autumn but scarce in summer. The reason for this is that in spring and autumn, while the days are warm, the nights become severely cold, so the water vapor that evaporated during the day quickly cools when night falls. Also, dew well moistens all things and nourishes plants and trees. In countries like "Egypt" in the continent of Africa, rain rarely falls throughout the four seasons, but as if by heaven's blessing, dew is abundant and

Therefore, dew and frost do not necessarily fall only from above. Thus, to prevent frost damage to planted trees, one should completely wrap and cover the trees to prevent them from releasing their inherent warm air.

Hail is called "hyō" (large hail). The reason why hail occurs more frequently in summer rather than in the cold season is that in summer, electricity is generated more often in the air, and extremely cold conditions occur in the atmosphere more frequently than in winter. If water vapor rises extremely high and becomes rain, but encounters this extreme cold during its descent, it freezes. Since there are both warm and extremely cold areas in the atmosphere, when hail falls, it temporarily creates strong winds or manifests changes like thunderstorms, making the atmospheric conditions abnormal.

　　○ On Volcanoes
Mountains that emit smoke, such as Japan's Mount Asama and Izu Oshima, number over three hundred worldwide, and these are called volcanoes. These occur when the gaps between rocks in the mountains contain large amounts of gases such as sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen, which rarely rupture to create holes, and when they come into contact with oxygen (a combustible gas) in the air, they ignite and emit smoke that rises to strike the heavens. The sight is truly terrifying, and they sometimes eject materials like quicklime.

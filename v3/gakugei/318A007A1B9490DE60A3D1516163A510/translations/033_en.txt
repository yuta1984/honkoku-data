《Commentary: Since this concerns lodging while traveling, he could not sleep through the night and describes his startled state wondering if dawn had come. The moonlight entering the mountains cast its shadow into the forest, making the sky shimmer, and the fishing fires among the autumn maples by the riverside appear before his eyes that had briefly slept a troubled sleep and awakened unrefreshed. So the night is deep. But when he listens doubtfully wondering if dawn has come, the sound of the temple bell at midnight from the mountain temple outside Gusu city can be heard reaching the boat he is aboard, and thus he knows that dawn has not yet broken.》

Night Mooring at Maple Bridge
By Zhang Ji

The moon sets, crows cry,
Frost fills the sky.
River maples and fishing fires face my troubled sleep.
Outside Gusu city,
At Hanshan Temple,
The midnight bell's sound
Reaches the traveler's boat.

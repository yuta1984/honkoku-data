In Response to Monk Hāochu Who Wishes to Ascend Immortal Mountain - by Liu Zongyuan

Jeweled trees luminous and clear are separated by green peaks, since my illness worldly affairs often go awry
The immortal mountain does not belong to guests who divide official tallies, I entrust it all to the flying staff that soars through the sky

《Commentary: The place where immortals dwell differs from the human world - even the trees are jeweled trees that shine luminously and clearly, visible across the separated green peaks. Since I am ill, even when I think to enjoy otherworldly pleasures together with you, everything conflicts and differs, not going as I wish. Originally, places like Immortal Mountain do not belong to officials like me who divide governmental tallies. Since you have attained supernatural powers, I leave it to you to soar through the sky with your flying staff. This is truly something beyond my reach and enviable》

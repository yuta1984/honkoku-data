Xi Shi's Stone
Lou Ying

Xi Shi once washed silk gauze at this ferry
Now green moss grows upon the stone
She who could kill men with her beauty, once she left
Gusu, never returned again
For whom do the peach and plum blossoms
Along the riverbank bloom in spring?

《Commentary: Xi Shi was a beautiful woman beloved by the King of Wu. Long ago at this riverbank she used to wash silk gauze. People say this is the stone where she used to sit, and now moss has grown over it. Anyone passing by who sees this stone cannot help but think of Xi Shi. However, once Xi Shi left for Gusu Terrace in the State of Wu, she never returned. Only the peach and plum blossoms continue to bloom along this riverbank, but with Xi Shi gone, for whom do they create this spring scenery? This poem expresses emotion through the flowers.》

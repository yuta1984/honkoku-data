　　Song of the Frontier　　　Monk Jiaoran

In the cold frontier fortress there is no reason to see falling plum blossoms
The sound of falling plum blossoms comes through the flute played by the barbarians

Above Laolao Pavilion, spring should be arriving
Night after night, the battle south of the castle has not yet ended

《Commentary: The frontier fortress where I have come is a cold place, so naturally there is no opportunity to see plum blossoms, and since I don't even know when spring arrives, there should be no chance to see plum blossoms falling either. In the evening, barbarians come and in the sound of the flute they play, I hear the melody of "Falling Plum Blossoms," but this is a place where one can never see real plum blossoms as in the capital. Around Laolao Pavilion in my hometown, spring has passed and the plum blossoms are blooming—I would like to return to see them, but since we are in the midst of military campaigns at the castle night after night, the roads are turbulent and I cannot return home》

Sent to Magistrate Linghu

At Mount Song's clouds and Qin's trees, long we've lived apart
Letters by paired carp come rarely, distant as they are
Please don't ask about the former guests of Liang Garden
At Maoling in autumn rain, the ailing Xiangru

Commentary: Since we parted, I have been living near Mount Song while you are in the capital of Qin, each of us separated by distance, so we have only the exchange of letters. But lately even the messages by paired carp come from so far away, and there has been no news from even a single letter - all correspondence has ceased. Surely you and others think that because I am at Liang Garden, I must be employed in good official positions like the ancient guests of King Xiao of Liang such as Zou Yang, but please don't ask whether this is really so. I too am bedridden with illness during this time of night rain, and like Sima Xiangru who withdrew due to illness, everything has been abandoned, so it's better that I remain in seclusion. Therefore, please don't bother to inquire about me. The real feeling behind this is resentment at not achieving success in life.

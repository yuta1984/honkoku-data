Ninth Day Banquet
Zhang E

Autumn leaves blown by wind turn yellow, rustling softly
Clear clouds illuminated by sun shine like white scales
Returning home, I was able to ask the woman selling dogwood:
"How many people climbed high today and became intoxicated?"

《Commentary: Since this is the Double Ninth Festival, this too is a work about climbing heights. Looking up from a high place, the tree leaves are blown by wind, turning yellow and fluttering rustlingly. The sky is clear and bright, with sunlight illuminating the few remaining white clouds that sparkle brilliantly. Coming down from the mountain, there is a peasant girl selling dogwood at the foot of the mountain, so I ask her: "Well now, many people must have climbed up today. How many held banquets and became drunk?" Most likely it was not just myself - everyone must have gotten drunk in their own way.》

Buddhist Temple　　　　　Shaku Reiitsu

Drawn by the tranquil moon of Hukei, we pass time together. Snow-laden pine branches are adorned with trailing vines. Though I wish to walk through the endless blue mountains, there are many old monks in the depths of white clouds.

《Commentary: Hukei is located within Mount Lu, where Master Eon once resided in his temple. Therefore, when one visits this temple, it resembles the same Hukei where Master Eon lived. The moon shines between, and drawn by its light, as one wanders here and there, since it is late autumn, the snow-bearing pine branches are beautifully draped with trailing vines - a most scenic view. The blue mountains near this temple are countless. When I think to walk through all these mountains and look around, I see many pure monks living in seclusion in places deep with white clouds. Indeed, they are different from ordinary people, dwelling in such quiet places.》

The heart of Tang poetry has been depicted in paintings as well, which must be due to parental devotion. These have been mostly selected as five-character and seven-character quatrains on cherry wood. Since there are still remaining works, and I intend to continue preparing them monthly with these various woods, I wish to inform those who wait and watch, so I write this in the depths of this publication.

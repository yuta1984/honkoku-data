Song of the Bian River　　　　　　Li Yi

The Bian waters flow eastward without end, spring returns unchangingly.
The Sui dynasty's palaces have already turned to dust.
Travelers, do not climb the long embankment to gaze upon it—
When wind rises and willow catkins dance, they kill people with sorrow.

《Commentary: Ever since the Sui Emperor Yang had this river dug and opened long ago, spring comes year after year endlessly and unchangingly, yet Emperor Yang's palace has completely vanished without a trace. Those who pass through this area inevitably climb this long embankment to gaze upon the scene. The reason the poet says "do not look" is because the willow trees along the long embankment are blown by the wind in a way too painful to bear watching—this is a broad expression of one's own grief》【Illustration】

The famous towers and magnificent pavilions, the flowers and feathers—
are these not the five- and seven-character regulated verse? Following the poetry to give form, creating
one illustration for each poem. If one copies the scenery too closely, it becomes stagnant;
if one departs too far from the scenery, it becomes dissolute. One should be appropriate to the abstract without
flowing into pure abstraction, appropriate to the concrete without
being mired in mere reality. Those who understand
these two principles can speak of the art of painting. Only then

does heavenly inspiration achieve transcendence, intention arrives and the brush follows. There is no place one goes
that is not suitable. Mr. Kitao, in this book, has exhaustively
brought forth his artistic conception, dividing and creating various forms,
each appropriately suited to its purpose. Indeed, wherever his brush reaches,
it is mature and never tedious. One can say there are no
regrets. This is what the ancients called "painting with sound."

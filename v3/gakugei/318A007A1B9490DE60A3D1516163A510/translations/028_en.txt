【Poem Title】Seeing Off a Parting at Mount Zeng

The desolate wanderer suffers like drifting mugwort,
Under the bright moon with green wine cups, we share but a brief moment.
Looking south, a thousand mountains appear like dark eyebrow paint,
I grieve that your traveler's path lies among them.【Illustration】

《Commentary: "Desolate" refers to being down and out. Looking at your departure, you appear wretched and forlorn. Being a wanderer, you have no fixed lodging and wander here and there like mugwort blown by the wind. This time too you are going toward Mount Zeng, so tonight we feast under the moonlight, but even this stay is only temporary. The direction you are heading is mountainous, appearing blue and thick like eyebrow ink, and I think with pity and worry that you will surely be traveling through those mountains.》

Lodging at Soha Station
　　　Wang Zhou

Autumn dyes the Chinese pear tree, half the leaves turning red
Looking eastward toward Jingzhou, grass stretches flat to the sky
Who would know the feelings of a lonely official at the edge of heaven?
Light rain falls softly in the ancient station

《Commentary: Since it is the middle of autumn, the pear leaves are also touched by frost and appear crimson with autumn colors. At this time, when I look eastward toward my hometown of Jingzhou, I cannot see any villages anywhere—only grass growing thick and vast, appearing to merge with the sky. Lodging on such a desolate journey, there is no one who knows that I have become a lonely official who has come to the ends of heaven and who would pity me for my various sorrows. Moreover, with light rain falling, there is no one in this ancient station who knows the loneliness and hardships I face in this quietly drizzling place and would show me compassion》

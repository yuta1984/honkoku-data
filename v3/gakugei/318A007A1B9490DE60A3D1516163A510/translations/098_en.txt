《Commentary: When a year passes, there is again the beginning of another year's spring, unchanging as always. Though human lifespan is said to be limited to one hundred years, there has never been anyone from ancient times who lived to one hundred years. Persuading the host, since human life is uncertain, opportunities to hold banquets before flowers like this will not come often. Even if the host says the sake is a bit expensive and costs money to buy, and declines saying he cannot afford it due to poverty, do not accept such refusal. Since no one lives to one hundred years and anyone might die at any time, it is good to drink and enjoy ourselves for a while.》

Banqueting at the Eastern Manor
　　　　Cui Mintong

Each year begins with one year's spring, yet at one hundred years there has never been a hundred-year-old person
How well we can face the flowers and become intoxicated several times
Buy wine for ten thousand coins and do not decline due to poverty【Illustration】

Respectfully harmonizing with the same as before
　　Cui Huitong

In one month the host laughs, how many times do we meet
Meeting each other and holding cups together, the spring colors we see with our eyes are like flowing water
Today's remaining flowers opened yesterday【Illustration】

《Commentary: Though you and I are close friends, opportunities to meet and enjoy ourselves like this within one month will not come frequently - it must be a rare occasion. When we meet like this today, it is good for us to feast together and enjoy ourselves. Why do I say this? Because the spring colors passing before our eyes are like flowing water that does not stay even for a moment. The flowers that bloomed yesterday have already fallen today. Human life is the same - having today but not knowing tomorrow, when we meet it is good to hold cups, laugh, and enjoy ourselves.》

Water Melody Song, First Movement

On the level sands the setting sun illuminates the western great wilderness
The bright stars above Long Mountain are high, then low again
On isolated peaks, how many places can one see the beacon fires?
Warriors with camps lined up await the sound of drums and war drums

Zhang Zirong

《Commentary: The evening sun over the flat desert, looking at the end of the endless world, the western great wilderness - the stars above Long Mountain that seemed high just moments ago now hang low, and since night has fully fallen, beacon fires can be seen in various places on the isolated mountains. The warriors who have set up their camps in rows remain vigilant, listening for the sound of war drums without relaxing their guard for even a moment. Though one may not fully understand what this poem expresses, it is said to describe the conditions of the frontier》

Following the army on a northern expedition

After snow on Tianshan, the sea wind is cold
The horizontal flute persistently plays "The Road is Hard"
In the desert are three hundred thousand soldiers
All at once they turn their heads to look toward the moon

[Commentary in smaller text]
After snow has fallen around Mount Tianshan, the sea wind is cold, and just traveling through this area is desolate. The horizontal flute persistently plays everywhere. Though other melodies would do, it plays "The Road is Hard," a tune that saddens travelers. In this desert there are probably about three hundred thousand men who have come on this military expedition, and all at once they turn their heads and look back, thinking "Alas, where is this pitiful tune being played?" as they gaze toward where it's being played in the moonlight.

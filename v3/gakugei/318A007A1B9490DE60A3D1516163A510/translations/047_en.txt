To the Singer He Kan

Twenty-odd years since leaving the imperial capital, hearing the heavenly music again, I cannot bear the emotion
Of old friends, only He Kan remains, who kindly sings the Weicheng song again【Illustration】

《Commentary: Since I left the imperial capital, I have long wandered and drifted, staying in remote frontier lands. Now that I have returned to the capital and hear the palace music again, though it should be delightful, remembering events from over twenty years ago makes me feel melancholy instead. Looking at the court now, not one of the friends with whom I once had close relationships remains - only He Kan the singer from the old days is still there. He kindly sings over and over again the Weicheng melody from when we parted years ago, but hearing this only increases my sadness》

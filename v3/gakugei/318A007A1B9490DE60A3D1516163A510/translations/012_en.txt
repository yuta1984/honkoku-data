A Song of Liangzhou: "The Yellow River ascends far into white clouds, a solitary fortress on a ten-thousand-foot mountain | Why should the Qiang flute blame the willow? Spring's light does not cross Jade Gate Pass" by Wang Zhihuan

[Commentary: From the direction of the Yellow River, going far up the river, it seems to ascend even into the clouds. If one were going to such a place where there were many castles, there might be some pleasure, but there is only a single isolated fortress on top of a ten-thousand-foot mountain, and this is the destination. The barbarians play tunes like "Breaking Willow Branches" on their flutes, and though one might dislike this for stirring feelings of separation, there is no reason to resent the flute. This is because spring's light does not reach beyond Jade Gate Pass to this side, so one never knows whether it is spring or autumn, and since they know nothing of willows and such, there is no resentment - yet this actually makes the resentment profound. Being in a place where spring does not reach, one feels the emotions of travel and a sense of loneliness.]

Song of the Border (Saijō no kyoku) by Wang Lie

My youthful red face ages year after year at Jinwei
Year after year I lie in iron armor on the sandy desert
Spring never enters White Grass Castle
Above Yellow Flower Garrison, geese fly constantly

《Commentary: Since my youth, year after year I have been unable to return to my hometown, standing guard here until old age, spending time in this desert. Year after year I sleep and wake in iron armor, without even a moment to remove my helmet and rest. White Grass Castle refers to that place - unlike the capital, this castle is a cold place where one cannot tell when spring comes, always remaining the same, never seeing flowers bloom. ○Around Yellow Flower Garrison, only geese are always there without cease, never going elsewhere, remaining here in a place remarkably different from the capital》

The lonely castle faces the garrison tower quietly in the evening
Ten-thousand-fathom mountains encircle the blue sky
No need for a bright mirror to see white hair growing
Wind and sand naturally teach how they age one's youthful face

《Commentary: The border fortress is an isolated castle with no allied strongholds nearby. At dusk, facing toward our garrison tower with no particular activity, just standing opposite each other. Only the ten-thousand-fathom mountains towering into the blue sky surround us, and we rely on this alone as we hold our position. Coming to such a place and enduring hardships, I need not wait to look in a bright mirror to know my hair has turned white. Because living in this wind-blown desert, even without looking in a mirror, I naturally understand and accept that my youthful appearance has deteriorated. Truly, it is a pitiful thing》

Lodging in the mountains of Shiyi

The floating clouds are not level with this mountain,
Mountain mists, blue-green and dense, make the view ever more bewildering,
The dawn moon briefly flies among a thousand trees,
The autumn river lies separated beyond several peaks to the west.

《Commentary: This mountain where I lodged is high, so the floating clouds only circle around its mid-slopes and are not level with the mountain. The mountain is also thickly forested, so one cannot tell which place is which, there is no distinction of direction, and the view becomes increasingly bewildering. The dawn moon that seemed visible just a moment ago has already flown away and hidden among the thousand trees, no longer visible. The Milky Way in the autumn sky is separated from here, lying to the west of several peaks thick with vegetation, so one cannot distinguish which is which in this vast mountain range.》

Written on the Wall of a Host in Chang'an　　　　　　Zhang Wei

When worldly people form friendships, they must use gold
If gold is not abundant, friendships will not be deep
Even if promises are made and they temporarily forgive each other
In the end, it becomes a heart of endless wandering

[Commentary: This poem was written when Zhang Wei was in the capital to take the imperial examinations. The host of his familiar lodging also thought that before passing the exam, he would be employed by the lord, so he respected him. At that time, since Zhang Wei brought gold and silver, the host treated him well. But when he failed the examination, the host no longer cared. Being indignant that human relationships are so callous, Zhang Wei wrote this poem on the wall.]

[Commentary: Generally speaking, worldly relationships are such that while one handles abundant gold, deep friendships are maintained, but when one becomes poor, people don't care and relationships become thin. Even if promises are made and they seem to forgive each other, making one feel reliable, when gold and silver are finally gone and one becomes poor, those who were previously intimate act as if they don't see you, like endless travelers on a road. How true it is that people have no substance!]

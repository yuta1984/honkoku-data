Writing My Feelings at the River Tower - Zhao Gu

Alone I climb the river tower, my thoughts boundless
Moonlight like water, water connecting to heaven
Those who came together to admire the moon - where are they now?
The scenery dimly resembles last year

Commentary: Last year many people came up together to enjoy themselves, but this year I climb alone and feel lonely, so my thoughts drift endlessly as I recall various things, even remembering last year. Looking down from the tower, the moon shines brilliantly, illuminating the water's surface pure white, and the water and sky merge into one color - a beautiful scene, but since I am alone in everything, it brings no comfort. The close friends who came together to this tower last year to appreciate the moon - where have they all gone this year? Not one remains. The scenery appears faintly, somehow dimly visible as it was, unchanged from last year, but people are inconstant - such is the sentiment that arose in him.

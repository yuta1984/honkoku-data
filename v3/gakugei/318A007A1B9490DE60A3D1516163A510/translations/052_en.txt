At Jialing Station

Leisurely the wind unfurls banners around mountains and rivers
The mountain station is misty, rain becomes smoke
Halfway on the road to Jialing, my head is already white
West of Shu Gate, I ascend further toward the blue sky

《Commentary: On this endless leisurely journey, particularly as the wind blows and unfurls the banners we carry, the scenery along the way as we wind through the treacherous places of mountains and rivers shows mountain stations shrouded in mist and clouds, with the rain that has been falling becoming like smoke, making it impossible to distinguish one place from another. Traveling through such places continuously, I have grown weary enough that my hair has turned white, but Jialing through which I now pass is only halfway on the journey - who knows how far it still is to Shu Gate in the west, such a distant place it is》

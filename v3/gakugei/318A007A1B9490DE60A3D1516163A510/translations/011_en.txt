Seeing Off a Person on a Mission to the River's Source

An old friend undertakes a mission toward a border province
On a single horse this morning, not staying even briefly
The long road through passes and mountains - on what day will it end?
The strings and bamboo instruments filling the hall now grieve for you

[Commentary: He goes as an envoy to the upper reaches of the Yellow River. This person now becomes an envoy from His Majesty and goes toward the border province of Heyuan. Rather than taking a large retinue, because it is official business, he rides on a single horse and departs in haste. The destination he travels to is a long journey on a long road, and particularly because he must pass through difficult terrain, there is no telling when he will arrive, and he will likely travel day after day. Thinking of what to give as a farewell gift, even playing music in this room would not be enjoyable. When I imagine the destination where you are going, the strings and bamboo instruments filling the hall grieve for you.] [Illustration]

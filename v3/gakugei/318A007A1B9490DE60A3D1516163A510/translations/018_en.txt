Sending Off Judge Li to the Runzhou Military Camp

Leaving home for ten thousand li, he takes up the duty of military drums
Taking the post road of Jinling, heading west of Chu clouds to Runzhou
The spring along the river refuses to detain the traveling guest
Only the verdant grass color sends off the horse's hooves

[Commentary: Now you leave home for the distant lands ten thousand li away, taking up military duties with drums and fifes, passing through the post stations of Jinling, heading toward Runzhou in the western part of Chu state. ○Even before I could try to detain you, I wondered if perhaps the spring scenery by the river might detain you, but it seems it will not. In the end, as this person rides his horse and parts the grass to go away, the luxuriant green grass behind seems to be seeing him off. Well, well, it cannot be helped—such is the poetic sentiment.] [Illustration]

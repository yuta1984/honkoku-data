Ninth Day　　　　　　Cui Guofu

By the river maples have fallen and chrysanthemums turn yellow
Young and old climb to high places, gazing as one toward home
On the ninth day, though wine is brought to Tao's house
For three years this traveler in Chu has already soaked his robes

[Commentary: Now at autumn's end, the maple leaves by the riverside have fallen and the chrysanthemums are turning yellow at their peak. The ninth day is an auspicious festival for climbing high places, when young and old alike all ascend to high places for enjoyment. Among them, travelers like myself just gaze intently toward our hometowns. In ancient times, on the ninth day, a man in white robes brought wine to Tao Yuanming's place - someone might send wine to me as well, but no matter what, having been a traveler in the state of Chu for three years, I have soaked my robes with tears that never have time to dry.]

Willow Branch Song - Wen Tingyun

Outside Guanwa Palace, west of Ye City
Distantly reflecting on征 sails, closely sweeping the embankment  
Binding fast the prince's urgent longing to return
Unrelated to the spring grass growing luxuriantly green

Commentary: Both Guanwa Palace built by King Fuchai of Wu and Ye City which was the capital of Wei are famous places for willows. Looking at these willows, in the distance the willows in front of Guanwa Palace reflect on ships passing far away, while nearby the willows west of Ye City hang their branches as if sweeping the embankment. Seeing these willows makes one intensely long to return home. "Binding fast" means the willow threads tie one down and prevent return. From the Chuci poem "The prince wanders and does not return, spring grass grows luxuriantly," those who travel are stirred to homesickness when they see spring grass growing vigorously. I too wish to return home in this way, but the willow threads bind my homesick heart and prevent my return, so I cannot even see the spring grass in my homeland growing green and luxuriant.

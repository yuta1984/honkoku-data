Han Palace Poem　by Li Shangyin

The blue bird flew west and never returned
The sovereign constantly remains at the Jiling Pavilion
Among the court ministers, Xiangru suffers most from the thirst disease
Yet not even one cup of dew from the golden stem is bestowed

Commentary: During Emperor Wu's time, when a blue bird came and perched only on top of the palace, he asked Dongfang Shuo about it, who answered that the Queen Mother of the West would soon come. At that time, the Queen Mother came and conversed with Emperor Wu, and when leaving, said she would come again in three years, but she never came. Abandoning this matter and criticizing his longtime fondness for immortals, the palace ladies voice their resentment. The blue bird flew away to the west, and the Queen Mother never came again. The sovereign believed these things to be true and constantly climbed the Jiling Pavilion to wait. Among the court ministers, there is Xiangru who suffers from the thirst disease close by his side, so it would be good if he had him drink a cup of dew from the golden stem that produces immortal medicine to test its efficacy before practicing his faith. Yet he does not do such things, but merely believes in things without proof. Being occupied with such matters, only performing purification rituals and not even entering the inner palace quarters - this is indeed a very foolish emperor.

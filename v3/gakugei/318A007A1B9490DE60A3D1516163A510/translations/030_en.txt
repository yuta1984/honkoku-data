Seeing off a friend who has become the governor of E Prefecture

A thousand homes at the river mouth are wreathed in Chu clouds,
River flowers scatter in disarray as snow flurries about,
In the spring wind and setting sun, who will share the view?
In a blue-sailed boat travels Lord E.

《Commentary: "Zhi" (知) is read as "tsukasadoru" (to govern) and refers to a magistrate. This is likely a friend of Han Hong.》

《Commentary: The river mouth where we now part has a thousand homes and mingles with the skies of the Chu region. The flowers along the riverbank are blown and scattered by the wind, swirling together with snow in a beautiful scene. During this time of spring wind and setting sun, when you go to your new posting, there will be no one to share this scenery with you, so you will be viewing it alone. How pitiful this is! Lord E was Zhe (possibly Zixi), a nephew of the King of Chu, who traveled in a blue-sailed boat according to the "Shuoyuan" (Garden of Persuasions), so this is mentioned in connection with the magistrate.》

Song of Liangzhou

In Fenglin Pass the water flows eastward, where white grass and yellow elms have grown for sixty autumns
All the border generals receive their lord's favor and grace, yet no one speaks of retaking Liangzhou

《Commentary: Around Fenglin Pass, water always flows eastward, and though this was originally territory of the capital, at some point it became a land of white grass and yellow elms belonging to the barbarians, and it has been about sixty years since it was taken from us. All the generals receive the lord's imperial favor without exception, but it is regrettable that none of them speaks of retaking this territory》【Illustration】

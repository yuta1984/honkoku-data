First Crossing the Han River　　　Anonymous

In Xiangyang, one looks well toward Xian Pavilion　People and things are desolate　belonging to year's end
To report to the Xi family: set out much wine　Last night's wind and snow　passed over the river's cold

《Commentary: Just now crossing the Han River and arriving at Xiangyang, when I view the scenery of the post station pavilion on Mount Xian here, it is quite an interesting place, but since it is winter, all human affairs and things are lonely, and the year is already drawing to a close, about to welcome the new year. Therefore I report: In this Xiangyang there are wealthy members of the Xi clan, and in this land the Marquis of Xiangyang held banquets in ancient times. Especially tonight, with wind and snow having crossed the river making it cold even here, to ward this off there is nothing better than wine, so much wine should be prepared for the banquet.》

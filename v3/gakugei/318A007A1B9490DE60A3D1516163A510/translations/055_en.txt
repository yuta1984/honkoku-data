Another (Continuation of Song of the Frontier Fortress)

Northern snow drifts and opens Yanmen Pass, level sands swirl chaotically rolling tumbleweed roots
I'm ashamed to count captured prisoners as merit; I'll directly behead the Loulan [king] to repay the nation's grace

《Commentary: Since this is a frontier fortress, wind and snow drift down from the north, so when we open the gate of the Yanmen garrison and look out, we see the flat desert with wind blowing wildly, rolling the roots of artemisia plants that appear withered. Since we've come to such a cold place and endure hardships, we should achieve great merit and raise our names throughout the realm. It's quite shameful to think of taking prisoners alive as merit and focus only on that. I won't concern myself with such things - I'll directly cut off the head of the Loulan king to repay our nation's grace and establish loyalty》

Autumn Boudoir Thoughts

Slanting moonlight creates deep radiance through the jade window, listening to cold crickets brings sorrow, tears moisten my clothes
In dreams I clearly see the frontier pass, but know not which road leads toward Jinwei

《Commentary: The moon shines slantwise through the latticed window where the woman dwells, glittering deep inside, creating a melancholy scene. When she hears crickets chirping beautifully here and there in the cold, she becomes even more lonely and thinks of her husband, tears moistening her clothes. As she thinks of her husband, she vividly sees in her dreams the frontier pass where he is stationed and feels as though she has met him, but being a woman she has no way to go there and knows no path. Yet somehow she traveled toward Jinwei - it's mysterious that she doesn't know the way》

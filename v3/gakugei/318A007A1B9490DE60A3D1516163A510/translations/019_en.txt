Spring Journey
Expressing One's Feelings
Li Hua

Below Yiyang Castle
the grass grows thick and green
The valley stream flows eastward
then turns again toward the west
The fragrant trees have no people
flowers fall by themselves
On the lone path through spring mountains
birds cry in vain

[Commentary: This Yiyang Castle in Henan Prefecture was once prosperous, but now no one comes and goes, and no one cleans it, so only grass grows thick and it has fallen into ruin, completely changed from the past. The only thing unchanged is the valley stream flowing east and then flowing west. In the past, crowds of people would noisily enjoy flower viewing and such, but now there is no one to see them, so the flowers are just left to fall in vain. On the road to Yiyang Castle, there are only birds singing in the spring mountains, with no one to appreciate them. This speaks of how remarkably different it is from the past.] [Illustration]

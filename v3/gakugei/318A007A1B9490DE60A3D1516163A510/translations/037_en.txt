What fortune for one in minor office to share the same era! For ten years without a patron, I alone remain behind.
Today let us not discuss the sash at your waist—I ask you to observe the threads at my temples.

《Commentary: Though I too hold such a minor official position, what fate has allowed me to serve in the same era as you? This is fortunate, but while you have steadily advanced in rank, I have been unlucky and remain in the same position. No one acts as an intermediary to recommend me for promotion, and I am left behind alone. Now, please don't speak of high or low positions—it's no longer about that. My temple hair has turned white like tangled threads, so even if promoted, I would be of no use》【Illustration】

[Commentary: The Jiting where I now reside is desolate and lonely, and it seems I have no intimate friends, though you alone are here. But we will soon part. Today fortunately is the festival of ascending heights on the ninth day, so I would like to climb somewhere high and hold a farewell gathering, but being a matter of travel, I don't know the circumstances - where shall I go to drink my wine? Since we part tomorrow, today let us enjoy chrysanthemum wine together, and tomorrow we shall scatter like broken tumbleweed. But thinking that I am parting from my one old friend makes it especially hard to bear.]

The Ninth Day
　Farewell
Jiting is desolate,
Old friends are few.
Where shall we climb high
And bid farewell?
Today briefly we share
Fragrant chrysanthemum wine.
Tomorrow we should
Fly apart like broken tumbleweed.

Meeting Zu Yong at a Luoyang Inn and Staying for a Banquet
　　Cai Xiji
Continuous water-clock drums in Luo-
yang city, the inn is quiet.
Living cut off from visitors, meeting
you I buy wine and thus become drunk.
After drunkenness, how can I know
The affairs of this world?

[Commentary: From early morning I constantly hear the drums marking time, and having entered an inn in Luoyang city where not a single person comes to visit, I feel lonely. But having met you, thinking "whatever happens," I offer wine, and I too drink and find comfort. While drunk on wine I forget worldly affairs, but what will happen after I sober up?] [Illustration]

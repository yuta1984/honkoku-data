From Langzhou to the Capital: A Playful Gift to Gentlemen Who Go Flower Viewing

In the purple streets of the capital, red dust swirls, people brush their faces as they walk
There is no one who doesn't speak of returning from flower viewing
In the grounds of Xuandu Temple, a thousand peach trees are all in full bloom
These are all trees planted after Liu Lang departed

《Commentary: The streets of the purple capital have now become filled with those who indulge in luxury, and every day great crowds pass through the town, kicking up dust so that people brush face against face as they pass. Since all the people in the capital are devoted to pleasure-seeking, everyone you meet speaks of returning from flower viewing. Around Xuandu Temple where Laozi is enshrined, flowers are blooming, and there must be about a thousand peach trees in total. These were not there when I (Liu Lang) was in the capital, but must have been planted while I was away in foreign lands. How completely different things have become from the past!》【Illustration】

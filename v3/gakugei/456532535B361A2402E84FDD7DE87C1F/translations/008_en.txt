Sending Off Cui Rong

The prince goes forth to become a general, the secretary follows the expedition from afar. The farewell tents stretch to the river palace, military banners shake Luoyang city.
Standards bear the morning's northern wind, reed pipes blow border sounds at night. I vaguely sense the sweeping away of smoke and dust, autumn wind over ancient Beiping.

This should be read together with the poem about Cui the Imperial Secretary's Eastern Expedition that appeared earlier. Wu Youji was enfeoffed as a prince and goes forth to face the Khitan, departing as a great general. You, having learning and talent, serve as a literary secretary and follow the expedition to distant places. Now, since we are sending off a prince, we sacrifice to Leizu, the god of roads, and set up tents—the seating extends all the way to the river and palace area. There the prince gives directions with his small banner, something like Japan's military signal fans, and its power is such that even Luoyang city trembles. When you go to face the Khitan, you will set up banners here and there, and morning after morning it will be cold with northern winds. Moreover, the barbarians blow the jia, a flute with a mournful sound, and night after night the borderlands will be sorrowful and lonely. "Sozoro ni" means vaguely, and "oboe" means to think. You are now a general, you and others are outstanding people, and because you take charge of affairs, I vaguely think that the smoke of beacon fires and the dust kicked up by horses' hooves will all be swept away, and from when the autumn wind blows, Beiping Prefecture will be retaken as in ancient times, and the tumultuous battles will be calmed and pacified.

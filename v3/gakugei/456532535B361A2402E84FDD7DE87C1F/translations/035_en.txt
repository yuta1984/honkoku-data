Seeing off Zhang Ziwei to Nanhai　　Cen Shen

Not choosing the post of Wei in Nanzhou, for there are aged parents in the high hall. Tower pavilions layer with mirage vapors, village settlements mix with shark-people. The sea is dark with rain over three mountains, flowers bright in spring of the Five Ridges. This land has much precious jade. Be careful not to despise honest poverty.

Among the officials whom everyone dislikes being sent to Nanhai, not choosing the Wei position is because of having elderly parents at home in the high hall. Nanzhou seems quite forbidding - when tower pavilions appear floating up from the sea, it is because dragon-mirages exhale their breath in layers. Moreover, in the coastal villages, sharks transform into humans to sell silk. Not only that, but Nanhai is dark with rain falling melancholically around the three mountains, and because it is a place of intense heat, the flowers must be in full bloom - the spring of the Five Ridges must be particularly moving. The land of Nanhai produces much precious jade, but since you go there out of filial piety, be careful to serve diligently without despising the poverty that comes from a pure and desireless heart - this is good advice I give you.

Autumn Thoughts (Shūshi)

Yellow leaves fall from Mount Yanzhi, and I, the wife, climb the terrace myself to gaze toward my husband.

The blue clouds over the sea have broken, and autumn colors come from the Chanyu's land.

Barbarian soldiers mass at the sandy fortress, while Han envoys return from Jade Gate Pass. The warrior on campaign has no day of return, and I grieve in vain over the withering of fragrant grass.

[Commentary]
This poem describes a wife's melancholy thoughts as autumn comes but her husband remains at the frontier without returning. Mount Yanzhi is in barbarian territory, a place where rouge (crimson dye) is produced. The leaves on that mountain must also be falling yellow. Since I long to see it, I forget myself and climb the high terrace to look out, but the sea where my husband went shows only faint blue clouds that break and disappear from view. The sorrowful autumn scenery seems to come from the Chanyu's barbarian lands.

I hear that barbarian troops are gathering at sandy fortresses and the fighting does not cease. An envoy sent from the capital to observe the barbarian situation returned saying he could not proceed beyond Jade Gate Pass. If so, then there is no set date when my husband on campaign will return. While I spend my time in various ways, months and years pass by, and though it serves no purpose, like the sad fragrant grass that withers and breaks, my face and form will also decline and decay.

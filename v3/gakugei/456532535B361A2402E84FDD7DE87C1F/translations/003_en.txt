Preface to the Picture Book of Tang Poetry Selection: Five and Seven-Character Regulated Verse
Master Jinan's Tang Poetry Selection divides the three hundred years of that era into four periods. Generally, from Wude to the beginning of Kaiyuan is designated as Early Tang; from Kaiyuan to the beginning of Dali as High Tang; from Dali to the end of Yuanhe as Middle Tang; and from Kaicheng to the Five Dynasties period as Late Tang. The collection includes works by two emperors, one hundred twenty court nobles and distinguished scholars, three persons of unknown name, and three Buddhist monks, with a total of four hundred sixty-five exquisite and masterful poems.

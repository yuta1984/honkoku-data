"Staying Overnight at Ryukoji Temple" by Qiwu Qian

In the fragrant temple, night comes and I forget to return home; the pines are pure beside the ancient palace doors. The lamp burns bright in the abbot's chamber, and prayer beads hang on the monk's robes. Like white daylight, the transmitted mind is pure; like blue lotuses, the subtle Dharma is explained. Heavenly flowers fall endlessly, and everywhere birds carry them as they fly.

Coming to this fragrant temple with a peaceful and delighted heart, I forgot to return home even as night fell. The pines also appear pure and distinguished before the ancient hall. As night deepens, the lamp brightly illuminates the abbot's chamber. This contains the meaning from the Vimalakirti Sutra about how the Dharma received from the Buddha ancestors never ceases, compared to how lamps are lit one after another and never go out. The pearl hidden within the robes also represents the pure heart unstained by the world, as found in the Lotus Sutra and Shurangama Sutra, subtly incorporated into the verse. The pearl hangs on the monk's robe. "Bhikhu" is a Sanskrit word meaning "monk." The pearl also refers to prayer beads. In any case, lamp and pearl are paired together. Pure like white daylight transmitting the Buddha's mind, the Dharma is likened to blue lotuses unstained by mud - a subtle meaning indeed. Mandala flowers flutter down from heaven and never finish falling to earth. Therefore, birds everywhere carry them as they fly about. This poem has poor balance between its beginning and end, and the seventh and eighth lines are mediocre. The title says "staying overnight" and describes the nighttime atmosphere, yet birds fly about - this might make sense if it referred to dawn. Chiba Genshi criticized how this poem's inclusion in Yulin's anthology is questionable and hard to accept.

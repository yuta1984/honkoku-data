Seeing Off Attendant Censor Zheng on His Banishment to Minzhong

Though you go in banishment, harbor no resentment, my lord. I have previously passed through Minzhong myself. Generally, autumn geese are few there, and only night apes are many. On the eastern road, clouds and mountains merge together, and in the southern sky, miasmic vapors have grown mild. You will naturally encounter the blessings of rain and dew. Go forth, and be cautious of wind and waves.

[Commentary]
Zheng is the surname, and "shiyu" (侍御) refers to a supervisory official. Being demoted to a post in the borderlands due to some offense is called "zhe" (exile), equivalent to demotion in Japan. Do not resent the place where you are going. I have passed through Minzhong before, and it is not particularly arduous. While I truly feel sorry for you, outwardly I offer comfort. The only unpleasant thing is that generally even in autumn there are few geese there. This is because there are places beyond Hengyang where they do not cross southward, so correspondence cannot get through. The character "是" is placed where it continues to the line below. The only troublesome thing is that many apes cry at night, which makes one remember one's hometown and feel sad. On the eastern roads, clouds gather on the mountains so thickly that sunlight cannot penetrate, but when you pass through consoling yourself, the timing will be good. Since it is now autumn in the south, the miasmic fevers have also subsided, so there is no cause for worry. Since the times are also good, you will naturally encounter the blessings of rain and dew. Go in good health. "Yi" (矣) is a word that firmly concludes a statement. Be cautious of the disasters of wind and waves, take care of yourself, and wait for your return to the capital.

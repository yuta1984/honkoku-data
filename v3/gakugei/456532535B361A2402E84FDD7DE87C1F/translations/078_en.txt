Lingyin Temple by Luo Binwang

The Vulture Peak rises densely and tall, while the Dragon Palace locks its gates in solitude. From the tower one views the sun over the vast sea, and the gate faces the tides of the Zhejiang River. Cassia seeds fall from within the moon, and heavenly fragrance drifts beyond the clouds. Grasping vines to climb the distant pagoda, hollowing wood to draw spring water from afar. Frost thin, flowers bloom anew; ice light, leaves wither in turn. From youth I have revered distant exotic places, opening my robe in contemplation, washing away the world's vexing clamor. Awaiting entry to the path of Mount Tiantai, watch me cross the stone bridge.

[Commentary]
Lingyin Temple, like the Vulture Peak of India, is a densely forested mountain temple rising high, so few pilgrims visit and even the Dragon Palace closes its doors in quietude. Yet the scenery is beautiful - from the tower of the mountain gate one can view the sunrise over the vast sea, and the gate faces the famous great waves and tides of the Zhejiang River. Now let me speak of the temple's mysterious true events. On autumn nights, cassia seeds like pearls fall from the moon to this ground, and the wonderful fragrance of heaven drifts as far as the clouds. These two lines are called "flowing water couplet." Since there are no paths to high places, one must grasp the vines growing down the cliffs to climb the distant pagoda. Wood is hollowed into bamboo pipes to draw spring water to the temple kitchen from the distant mountain depths. Though it is deep in the mountains, since frost falls lightly in season, flowers bloom here and there, and since ice is light, leaves scatter here and there. I too have revered such places that distance one from the world since my youth. What is joyful is that today I open my robe in contemplation and wash away the world's troublesome and noisy defilements, purifying my heart. Originally Song Zhiwen composed this, but Binwang added to it to make the complete poem, so it is attributed to Binwang. This temple is not all - wait until entering Mount Tiantai and see me cross the narrow stone bridge overlooking an unfathomably deep valley, boasting of a heart unstained by the world.

Seeing Off a Friend Entering Shu

I hear that the road of Cancong is treacherous and not easy to travel. Mountains rise up from before one's face, and clouds are born beside the horse's head.

Fragrant trees envelop the Qin plank roads, spring streams flow around the city of Shu. Since rise and fall in fortune must already be determined, there is no need to necessarily consult Junping.

[Commentary]
I hear that the mountain path opened by Cancong is steep and difficult to pass—an exceptionally treacherous route. With mountains stretching in all directions, they tower up right before your nose, and clouds emerge from beside your horse's head. However, the timing of your departure is good. While the capital has its flower season in the second and third months, Shu is a cold mountain region where flowers bloom and ice melts in the fifth month. The fragrant flowering trees will beautifully conceal the Qin plank bridges. The snowmelt waters will flow around the city of Shu, and the mountain and water scenery will be delightful.

To console my friend: since a person's rise and fall in fortune is determined early on, even if you meet a diviner like Junping, it would be better not to have your fortune told. Set your mind at ease and settle peacefully in Shu.

Yan Junping of the Han dynasty was an excellent master fortune-teller who practiced divination in Chengdu of Shu. The ancestor of Shu was an ancient person who founded the country—when one speaks of Cancong, it refers to Shu. This appears in the "Rhapsody on the Shu Capital" in the Wenxuan. The Qin plank roads refer to the bridges built during the Qin period.

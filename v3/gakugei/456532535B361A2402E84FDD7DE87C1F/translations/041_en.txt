Seeing Off Liu Pingshi on His Appointment as Judge of Shuofang, Composing a Poem with the Rhyme "征馬嘶" (War Horses Neighing)　　　　　　Gao Shi

The war horses head toward the border states, neighing forlornly without rest. Deep thoughts constantly bear the pain of separation, their voices breaking as they carry the sorrow of autumn. At the crossroads, wind blows from afar, and together with the moon over passes and mountains, they share in melancholy. I present this poem to you as you depart from here. On what day will you return to the capital (literally: "big sword hilt")?

[Commentary]
Shuofang is a region bordering the northern barbarian lands. As the war horses advance toward the barbarian territories in the border states during travel, they neigh mournfully and ceaselessly. Because sorrowful feelings penetrate deeply, they constantly bear the suffering of separation. Their voices fade because they simultaneously carry the sadness of autumn. At the crossroads, wind blows from distant places, and one travels with it. In the yuefu (music bureau poems), there is one called "Guanshan yue" (Moon over Passes and Mountains). Drawing on this, the melancholy moon illuminating the passes and mountain paths increases one's sorrow. I present this poem to you and bid farewell, but on what day will you return to the capital? There is a ring on the sword hilt head. "Ring" (huan) connects with "return" (huan), used in the meaning of coming back.

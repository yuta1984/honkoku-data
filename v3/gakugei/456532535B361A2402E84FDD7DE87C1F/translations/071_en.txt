Shengguo Temple - Shi Chumo

The path ascends from the middle peak, winding around and emerging through the ivy. Reaching the river, Wu territory ends; across the shore, Yue mountains are numerous. Ancient trees cluster in blue mist, the distant sky merges with white waves. Below, the city walls are near, and bells and stone chimes mingle with flute songs.

The path to this temple climbs up from the middle of the peak. Winding here and there, passing under ivy hanging from pines and cedars, one reaches the temple. Looking around in all directions, one can see all of Wu territory extending to the northwest of the Zhe River. Across the Zhe River to the southeast, the mountains of Yue stand in rows, appearing numerous. Ancient trees grow thick with blue mist gathering around them, and the distant sky appears to merge seamlessly with the white waves of the Zhe River. Below the mountain is the busy harbor of Qiantang, so the bustling city walls appear nearby. During sutra chanting before the Buddha in the temple, the sounds of bells and stone chimes mix together with the lively music and songs from below the mountain.

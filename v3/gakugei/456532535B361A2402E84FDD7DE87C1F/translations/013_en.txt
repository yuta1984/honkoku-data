By Imperial Edict, a banquet was bestowed at the Reisei Palace Academy　In response to the imperial command, obtained the character "Lin" (forest)　Zhang Yue

The eastern wall is a repository of books, the western garden is a forest of scholars and ink. Reciting poetry to hear of state affairs, lecturing on the I Ching to perceive the celestial mind.
My position steals the weight of harmonious governance, imperial grace indulges deeply in wine's intoxication. Thus singing the song of spring's delight, exhausting all emotion is for the sake of one who understands.

During the Kaigen era of Tang, Zhang Yue was honored as the head of literary scholars. Summoning various scholars for a wine banquet bestowed by imperial grace, when composing poetry by imperial command, the rhymes were distributed and he obtained the character "Lin." The two stars of the eastern wall govern books - the repository of books is where writings gather. Wei's Cao Zijian once gathered many scholars in the western garden. Collecting poems from various provinces to reform the good and evil of government, lecturing on the I Ching to see whether the duties of various officials accord with the celestial mind. "Harmonious soup" takes from the text of Yue Ming in the Book of Documents, likening governing the realm to cooking - serving in matters beyond one's abilities is like stealing one's position. Becoming intoxicated by imperial grace's wine and exhausting all emotion in music is done hoping the Son of Heaven will listen with understanding. There is a historical tale where Zhong Ziqi could distinguish musical tones well, but when he died, Boya broke his qin, saying there was no one left in the world who understood music, and never played again for the rest of his life. Here the sentiment is hoping the Son of Heaven will listen with understanding.

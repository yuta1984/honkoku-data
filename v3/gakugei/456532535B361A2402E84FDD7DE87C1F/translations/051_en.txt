Jade Terrace Temple

Through vast eons caused by royal construction, visiting the flat terrace's ancient pleasures. Colorful clouds where Xiao Shi lingered, inscriptions where Lu Gong remained. Palace gates connecting to assembled emperors, heaven and earth reaching the Ten Isles. People say there are reed pipes and cranes, sometimes passing over North Mountain's peak.

Founded by Tang's Prince Teng Yuanying, this is where Daoist practitioners live and study the Way of the immortals, taking Laozi as their principal deity, much like Japanese mountain ascetics in their devotions, naming their dwelling place the Temple Pavilion. This temple's origins were created by a person of noble lineage, and its magnificence rivals even the flat terrace built by the filial king of Liang. I have come to visit this place where Prince Teng once held his entertainments in ancient times.

The temple's decorative panels feature carved scenes of Xiao Shi and Nong Yu playing their reed pipes, with phoenixes dancing. The calligraphy on the "Jade Terrace Temple" plaque is by Prince Teng's own brush, comparable to King Gong of Lu, and his handwriting remains visible. From this temple's palace gates, one can surely commune with the assembled divine emperors who govern the four directions. Moreover, from this universe one can surely reach the Ten Isles where immortals dwell. The local people tell that Prince Jin, son of King Ling of Zhou, played the reed pipe

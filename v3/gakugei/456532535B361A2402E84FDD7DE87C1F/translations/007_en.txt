Sending Off Du the Junior Prefect to His Post in Shuzhou　　Wang Bo

The city walls support the Three Qin regions, wind and mist look toward the Five Fords. The feeling of parting from you—we are both traveling officials. Within the seas, true friends exist; at heaven's edge, it's like being next-door neighbors. Do not act uselessly at the crossroads, wetting handkerchiefs together like children and women.

Du is the surname, and Junior Prefect is an official title. He was transferred from a treasury position to become an official in Shu, and this is a poem sending him off. The state of Shu where you are going must defend strategic positions. Should any emergency arise in the capital, the emperor would also make an imperial progress there. Therefore, it is under the assistance of three government offices in the capital. The scenery there overlooks the five ferry crossings. When barbarians try to invade the capital, they cannot come without passing through the five ferries. So watchmen officials keep watch over the five ferries day and night. It is a place that requires vigilance. Now, though my feelings of parting from you are endless, since both you and I are destined to go from the capital to other provinces as officials, I too will tomorrow go to serve as an official in some unknown country, and when we might meet again is uncertain. Within the seas all nations are the same—wherever we go under heaven, as long as our hearts remain unchanged, even the distant ends of heaven between Qin and Shu will seem like neighboring houses side by side. However, parting is painful, and at these sorrowful crossroads, we shed tears that wet our handkerchiefs like women and children together. Even though we speak proper words on the surface, naturally our true feelings show through, and this display of reluctant parting is as it should be.

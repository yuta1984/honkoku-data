Composed on the Journey While Accompanying the Emperor to Mount Taishan for the Feng Sacrifice　Song Zhiwen

Tent-palaces rise majestically on the towering peaks, this divine journey is truly magnificent! Dawn clouds unfurl connected to the pavilions, night fires mingle with the stars as they wheel around.
From dark valleys a thousand banners emerge, mountains echo as the Ten Thousand Chariots arrive. This imperial journey truly deserves to be commemorated in verse, yet I ultimately lack talent vast as heaven.

Dengfeng (the Feng sacrifice) refers to building a stone altar to worship Heaven, which is called "feng." The tent-palace is a temporary palace made of curtains, constructed on a steep mountain. The imperial journey to this place is truly a magnificent spectacle. When night breaks and one rises early, it describes heaven mingling with humanity. The dawn clouds unfurl continuously like curtains. When lodging in the evening, it describes humanity reaching toward heaven. When one climbs the mountain's temporary palace carrying torches, their light mingles with the stars as one. Though the high places dawn early, the many attendants lodge in the valleys where it is still dark, yet countless people emerge carrying banners. The human voices are clamorous, and when the mountains echo with three cries of "Long live the Emperor," it is the scene of His Majesty arriving in the imperial carriage. For such an auspicious imperial procession, one should indeed compose poems of reverent joy in any manner, but because I lack talent vast enough to cover heaven, I humbly retreat with only my heart's devotion. Yet in reality, for such a great ceremonial occasion, it would be good even if commanded to write inscriptions for monuments to remain for future generations—this implication is also carried between the lines. In this poem, either "senyu" (divine journey) or "koyu" (imperial journey) contains an error of one character.

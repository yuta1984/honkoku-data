Inscribed on the Wall of Zen Master Genbu's Dwelling

In what year did Gu Hutou paint the immortals' isle of Cangzhou across the entire wall? The red sun and rocky forest's warmth, the blue sky where rivers and seas flow. The flying staff always draws near to cranes, crossing by cup without startling the gulls. It seems I have found the path to Mount Lu, to follow Huiyuan directly in wandering.

In what year did the famous painter Gu Hutou of the Jin dynasty paint the immortal realm of Cangzhou across the entire wall? The red sun rises, and warm energy seems to transfer to the stones and forest. Rather than saying "color," using "energy/atmosphere" excellently expresses the wonder of the painting. Continuous with the blue sky, the rivers and seas are painted flowing endlessly wide. A Buddhist monk with a flying staff has cranes that always approach and are familiar with him. Where a renowned monk floats across using a cup as a boat, gulls remain unafraid and intimate. The words "always," "approach," and "not" all describe aspects of the painting. If they were alive, cranes and gulls might indeed fly about. "Cup-crossing" refers to a small boat. Now, meeting this Zen master today feels like finding the path to Mount Lu and following Master Huiyuan in spiritual wandering. The seventh and eighth lines describe the poet's own experience.

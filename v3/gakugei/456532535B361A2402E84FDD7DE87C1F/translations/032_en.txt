Seeing off Liu Sizhi as he departs for Anxi

The road to Yang Pass in the distant realm, barbarian sand and fortress dust. In the three spring months there are geese, but travelers are few across ten thousand li.
Alfalfa follows the heavenly horses, grapes pursue the Han ministers. One should make foreign countries fear, not daring to seek peace treaties.

Liu is the family name, and Sizhi goes to Anxi to inspect military achievements. Sizhi is an official who serves close to the ruler. "Jue" (絶) in the poem means distant. The road crossing Yang Pass of the barbarians shows only the sandy plains of barbarian lands and dust rising from battlefields. Moreover, because the climate is cold, there are geese until the end of the three spring months. Being ten thousand li away, travelers are rare and it is lonely. However, when he arrives and his inspection is proper, the barbarians will fear him and offer alfalfa, a medicinal grass for horses, and the heavenly horses from barbarian lands will also be offered following suit. By all means, they will also offer famous grape wine, chasing after his footsteps. "Dang" (当) means "should do thus." One should make the foreign barbarian tribes fear. "Gande" (敢て) means recklessly, so one should not make peace treaties or reconciliations, and should not seek cowardice.

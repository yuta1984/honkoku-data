The Hu Horse of Military Clerk Fang

The Hu horse bears the fame of Dayuan, its lean bones formed like sharp ridges. Its paired ears are steep like split bamboo, wind enters its four hooves making them light. Wherever it heads, there is no void or vastness; truly it can bear the trust of life and death. Having such galloping prowess, it can traverse ten thousand li at will.

Military Clerk Fang returned to the capital riding a Hu horse - it is a famous horse from the country of Dayuan. Lean like the edge of a spear point, its bone structure is firmly and strongly built. Its two ears are sharply pointed like a shaved bamboo scraper. When it gallops, wind rises from beneath its feet as if it rides upon it, so its hoofbeats are light and nimble. Whatever distant and wide places it heads toward, it treats as nothing. In battle, this is the real thing - quick to flee when defeated, and when victorious, chasing and cornering the enemy. It can bear the trust of both life and death. Having such spirit of galloping and leaping, it should be able to travel freely across ten thousand li. Though the entire poem praises the horse, in truth it uses this as a pretext to praise the courage of Master Fang.

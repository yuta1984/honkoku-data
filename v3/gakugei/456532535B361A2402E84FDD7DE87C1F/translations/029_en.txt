Passing by Xiangji Temple

Not knowing where Xiangji Temple is, I enter the cloudy peaks for several li. Among ancient trees there is no human path;
In the deep mountains, from where does this bell sound? The spring's voice chokes against dangerous rocks, the sun's rays are cold through green pine.
At dusk by the bend of an empty pool, in peaceful meditation I subdue the poison dragon. [Seal: "Tenshin"]

I had heard that there was a temple in these remote mountains, but because they are so deep, I did not know where it was located. Proceeding along the mountain path, I climbed for four or five li into peaks shrouded in clouds. The condition of the path was such that ancient great trees grew densely together, and since no one came to worship there, there was no path to follow. As I gradually climbed higher, I heard a bell ringing from somewhere unknown in the depths of the mountains beyond. When I finally reached the temple, I found that the sound of springs in the valley stream struck against protruding rocks, making a pitiful sound like a person choking. The sunlight did not penetrate beneath the thick green pines, so it was chillingly cold. As evening approached, sitting quietly by the bend in the deep pool water to calm my heart, it seemed that I could suppress the worldly desires and delusions that cloud the mind—likened to a poison dragon—and achieve clarity of heart.

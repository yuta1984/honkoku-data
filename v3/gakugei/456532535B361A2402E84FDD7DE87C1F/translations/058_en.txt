【The Temple of Yu】

The Temple of Yu stands in the empty mountains, where autumn winds blow and the setting sun slants down. In the desolate courtyard, oranges and citrons hang heavy, while dragons and serpents are painted on the ancient roof. Cloud vapors rise from the bare walls, and the sound of the river rushing over white sand can be heard. Long ago it was known that riding in four kinds of vehicles, he dredged waterways and controlled the three rivers of Ba (the great river of Shu).

【Commentary】
King Yu assisted Emperor Shun in governing the realm, and later received the abdication of power, founding the Xia Dynasty. Due to his great virtue in controlling floods throughout the realm and saving all people, temples were built and he is worshipped in various places throughout the provinces. This is the temple located in Linjiang County of Zhongzhou.

From the scene of this temple standing in the lonely mountains, the poet created contrast between the preceding and following couplets. Now, when paying respects, it was a lonely time with autumn winds blowing and the setting sun slanting down. In the courtyard, left unswept and fallen into ruin, oranges and citrons hang abundantly. If this were a thriving shrine with many worshippers, even posting prohibition signs saying "Do not pick the oranges and citrons" would not provide peace of mind. Dragons and serpents are painted on the ancient roof - this verse follows the method called "determining before and after," drawing clouds from the dragons and serpents. Since this temple is located in the mountains, cloud vapors arise from the white walls. From the Min River, four or five towns away from the temple, the sound of flowing water can be heard as if white sand were rushing along. This verse exists because the poet wanted to speak of Yu's control of the waters.

Coming to this place, one quickly understands that long ago, when floods covered the realm, to travel on land, through mud, over water, or climbing mountains, he rode in four different kinds of vehicles, dredging waterways and controlling the San Ba, the great river flowing from Shu, working tirelessly to save the people of the realm from their suffering.

It took eight years to control the floods throughout the realm. During this long period, though he passed by his home three times, he never entered, his hands and feet cracked and chapped from dedicating himself entirely to flood control. That people could live in security and cultivate their fields was all due to his devoted efforts. The heart of a sage thinks only of saving the people from their suffering as quickly as possible.

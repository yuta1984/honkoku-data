Given to Zhang Jiuxu After Drinking

People in this world carelessly seek to make many acquaintances, but this old man is particularly different. When inspiration comes, his calligraphy naturally becomes divine; after drinking, his words are most erratic. With white hair he grows old in idle pursuits, while blue clouds of ambition remain before his eyes. With one pot of wine at the bedside, how many more times can we sleep?

People in this world tend to carelessly seek wide social connections, but this old man is particularly not like that. When he drinks a cup and gets inspired, his cursive writing naturally becomes excellent. After getting drunk, even his conversation becomes full of mistakes and boasting, like a madman. Until his hair turns white, he passes his old age in idle pursuits like drinking and writing. Even when opportunities for advancement are right before his eyes, he does not envy them. Now, since you and I are true friends, let us drink together from one pot of wine on the bed, and may we often sit facing each other, getting drunk and sleeping many times over - these are words I offer with sincere affection.

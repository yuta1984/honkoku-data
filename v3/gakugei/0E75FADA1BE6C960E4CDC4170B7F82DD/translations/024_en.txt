Generally speaking, shops should be kept clean and beautiful, and greetings, responses, and hospitality should be conducted with gentleness and courtesy. If one greatly covets high profits and deceives people, one will incur divine punishment, and few people will come to visit repeatedly. Fear the way of Heaven. Those who work diligently will ultimately achieve wealth, prosperity, and the flourishing of their descendants.

○Yukata is bathing kimono. It is also written as "mei'i." Bath towels are called "yokukin."
○"Heishitsu" is read as "covering the knees." It is an apron. "Hitsu" is the same.
○"Kai" includes thread shoes and hemp shoes. Straw sandals may be written as "屩" or "屝."
○"Geki" are wooden clogs. What commoners call "ashida" (geta) have straps called "gekikei," also called "bijō." There is also something called "heshiki" worn in snow.
○"Nō" (bags): those with bottoms are called "nō," those without bottoms are called "taku." Both are bags. "Tai" is the same.
○"Dōbuku" is the clothing of religious practitioners. Writing it as "dōbuku" is incorrect. Commoners call this "haori."

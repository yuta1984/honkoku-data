He was the son of Iyo-no-suke (Governor of Iyo). Initially he held the position of Ukon-no-shōgen (Assistant Captain of the Right Division), but when Genji was stripped of his court rank, he too was removed from the court register. He accompanied Genji to Suma and later, in the "Miotsukushi" (Channel Buoys) chapter, became Kurōdo-no-yugehi-no-jō (Palace Attendant and Assistant of the Quiver-Bearer). This poem was composed when he accompanied Genji on a farewell visit to the former emperor's mausoleum before Genji's move to Suma. Upon seeing Kamo Shrine, he recalled the time when he had accompanied Genji to the Saiin's purification ceremony and composed this verse. The meaning is: remembering the grandeur of that time when we rode alongside Genji wearing hollyhock leaves in our caps, even the gods must find it painful and resentful that the world has come to this. He plays on the word "sono kami" (that time/the gods). "Mizugaki" (sacred fence) is an honorific reference to Kamo Shrine.

Kurōdo-no-yugehi-no-jō (Palace Attendant)
Leading horses together,
adorned with hollyhock—
remembering those days
brings pain
at Kamo's sacred fence.

He was the son of Genji's wet nurse, the nun Daini. Initially he was Minbu-no-taibu (Senior Secretary of Popular Affairs), in the "Otome" (The Maiden) chapter he became Settsu-no-kami (Governor of Settsu), and in the "Umegae" (Plum Blossoms) chapter he became Saishō (Minister). He was someone whom Genji employed with particular intimacy. This poem was composed when he accompanied Genji to Suma and saw wild geese. The meaning is: hearing the voices of geese who have willingly left their homeland of the eternal world to cry in this traveler's sky is sorrowful—something I used to think of as other people's business in the past. Now, listening as one who is also a traveler, I can no longer think of it as someone else's affairs. This sentiment is implied in the poem.

These geese who
willingly
abandoned
the eternal world
to cry—
even in distant clouds
I had thought of them
with indifference.

This is a lady-in-waiting to Suetsumuhana (Princess Hitachi). This poem was composed when Genji began visiting Suetsumuhana and sent the poem: "How many times must I lose to your silence? This body that does not say 'do not speak.'" This is the reply given on behalf of Suetsumuhana. The meaning is: "I do not think I should simply remain without reply, but I am too embarrassed to respond, and I am confused and distressed by my own lack of composure." This refers to the children's "silence game" where they strike a bell and become silent.

Lady-in-waiting (Jijū)
To strike the bell
and close [in silence]
is natural, yet
replying is painful—
how unreasonable it is

This is the daughter of Prince Hitachi. In the "Suetsumuhana" chapter she first meets Genji, and in the "Yomogiu" chapter she is moved to the Eastern Palace. She is a princess of poor appearance. This poem was composed when she sent Genji a faded court robe as New Year's attire for the first day of the year. The meaning is: because your heart is shallow and cruel, my sleeves have become wet with tears and changed color like this. "Kara-koromo" (Chinese robe) is used as a pillow word for "kimi" (you), but it also refers to the actual garment being sent.

Chinese robe—
because your heart
is so cruel,
my sleeves are thus
ever dampened with tears

He is a prince of the new emperor, and his mother is Akashi Chūgū. In the Niou Miya (The Fragrant Prince) chapter, he comes of age and becomes Minister of War. This poem is his reply to a poem sent by the Lay Priest Prince when he visited Uji for cherry blossom viewing: "Though the mountain wind's voice disperses the mist, the distant white waves appear separated from us." The heart of the poem is: even though the waves on the shore separate us here and there across the river with no path between, may the wind still blow and connect us. In other words, even if we cannot meet directly right now, please let our hearts communicate.

Prince Niou, Minister of War
Though the waves
of far and near shores
may separate us,
still blow through and connect—
wind of the Uji River

She is the daughter of the Lay Priest Prince and the younger sister of Princess Agamaki by the same mother. In the Agamaki chapter she becomes intimate with Prince Niou, and in the Sawarabi (Bracken Shoots) chapter she is welcomed to the same prince's Nijō mansion where she bears his child. This poem is her reply to one sent from Prince Niou when she was still living in the village of Uji: "We gaze upon the same cloudy sky—why then does the winter shower bring such uncertainty?" The heart of the poem is: when winter showers fall in the capital, hail falls in the mountain village, and both the sky I gaze upon in my melancholy morning and evening, and my heart, grow dark and desolate.

Middle Princess of Uji
In the deep mountain village
where hail falls,
morning and evening
the sky I gaze upon
grows ever darker

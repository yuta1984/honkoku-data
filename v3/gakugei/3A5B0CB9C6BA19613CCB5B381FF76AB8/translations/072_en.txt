He is a son of Emperor Kiritsubo and the younger brother of Genji. Initially called Sochi no Miya, he became Hyōbukyō (Minister of War) in the Otome (Maidens) chapter and passed away in the Kōbai (Red Plum Blossoms) chapter. This poem was composed when he courted Tamakazura. The heart of the poem is: even the feelings of a firefly, whose voice cannot be heard, cannot be extinguished by outside forces trying to put it out. How much more difficult it is to stop a person's burning love! He adds fire to the metaphor of passionate feelings.

disappear
when people try
to extinguish them?

Her father is the Assistant Middle Controller, and her mother is the wet nurse of Kashiwagi, the Right Gate Guard Captain. She served at Uji Palace, and after Princess Agemaki passed away, she became a nun in the Sawarabi (Bracken Shoots) chapter. This poem was composed lamenting the death of the princess. The heart of the poem is: no matter what happens, tears flow first and become like a river. If I had thrown myself into that river of tears, I could have died without being left behind by the princess.

the river of tears
that flows ahead,
my life would not
have lagged behind hers

This is the holy man who performed prayers to cure Genji's ague (malaria). This is a poem composed when he received a cup of sake from Genji at the same time as mentioned above. The meaning is that a holy man who had never left his deep mountain hermitage happened to appear before a noble person and see an unfamiliar countenance for the first time - this sentiment is expressed through the metaphor of flowers. "The face of flowers" appears frequently in poetry collections.

Holy Man of Such-and-Such Temple
In the deep mountains,
rarely opening
the pine door,
I see the face
of an unknown flower.

She is the daughter of Prince Shikibu-kyō, and her mother was the daughter of Azech no Dainagon. Having lost her mother at a young age, she was raised by her grandmother, a nun, in Kitayama, from where Genji brought her, and she disappears in the "Minori" (The Law) chapter. She is the foremost among Genji's beloved women who resided at Rokkō-in. She is called "Haru no Ue" (Lady of Spring). This poem is a reply to Genji's New Year's Day poem celebrating the rice-cake mirror: "In the pond's mirror where thin ice has melted, shadows without substance in this world are reflected together." The meaning is that the garden pond water, mirror-like, clearly shows the image of one who should dwell with her lord for ten thousand generations. The pond water is compared to the rice-cake mirror, with a play on words between "sumu" (to dwell) and "sumu" (to be clear).

Lady Murasaki
In the unclouded
mirror of the pond,
the image of one who should dwell
for ten thousand generations
is clearly visible.

This is the woman who played the koto, and this is her reply to the above courtier. The previous poem was composed as if suggesting this woman had other people waiting for her, while this reply in turn portrays that courtier as a cold-hearted person.
The meaning is: since your flute harmonizes with winds that blow here and there, I have no words to detain you. Since it is now the tenth month, she speaks of "kogarashi" (autumn wind), adding "koto" (both meaning "word/thing" and referring to the musical instrument) to her words.

To the autumn wind
your flute harmonizes—
I have no words

This is the person who participated in the ranking of women during Genji's rainy night tales. This poem was composed when he had made a promise with a Confucian scholar's daughter and went to visit her, but she had eaten garlic due to a cold and said in Chinese "Tonight my breath smells bad, please wait until this time passes and then come." Since this was unbecoming of a woman and disagreeable, he composed this as he fled back home. The meaning is: even spiders' behavior can predict that I would come tonight, yet without such understanding, saying to wait until the garlic smell fades is unreasonable. ○This was composed based on the poem "waga seko ga ku beki yo nari" (this is the night my beloved will come). "Hiru" (garlic) is associated with "hiru" (daytime). "Ayanaki" means "wakenaki" (unreasonable) in common speech.

On this evening when
spider behavior reveals
[your coming],
saying "wait until daytime passes"—
how unreasonable!

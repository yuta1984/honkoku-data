She was a court lady (kōi) of Suzaku-in and the mother of Princess Ochiba. This poem is her response to Yūgiri's consolation poem when he visited to mourn Kashiwagi's death after Princess Ochiba had become Kashiwagi's consort: "When the season comes, they bloom in unchanging color—even the cherry blossoms of a dwelling where one branch has withered." The meaning is that this spring, with the grief of Kashiwagi's mysterious death, tears like jewels never cease from her eyes. The poem alludes to dewdrops strung like jewels on willow buds, comparing Kashiwagi's death to the scattering of flowers.

This spring,
the jewels threaded
on willow buds—
I know not where
the scattered flowers have gone.

She was a princess of Suzaku-in, the Second Princess. Her mother was a low-ranking court lady. In the Wakana chapter, she became Kashiwagi's consort, and after Kashiwagi's death, she became Yūgiri's beloved. She is also called Ichijō-miya or Ono-miya. This poem was composed when her mother the court lady died and she was about to be taken by Yūgiri to move to Ichijō-in. The meaning is that she wishes her body could vanish together with the smoke of her mother's cremation, so that she would not have to go in a direction that goes against her heart—toward Ichijō.

Princess Ochiba
Rising toward
the peak, may I mingle
with that smoke
and not be drawn toward
a direction I do not desire.

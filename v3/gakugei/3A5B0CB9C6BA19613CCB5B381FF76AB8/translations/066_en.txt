This is the name of a young girl. She was someone who supported the left side, the losing side. The heart of her poem is: "Even if you think of them so possessively as your own, flowers are things that the wind freely scatters. Even if you think not to let their fragrance scatter toward others, are there sleeves in this world large enough to cover the great sky? There are not!" She argued back in this way. In response to the right side's poem "Though scattered by the wind of the great sky," she composed this poem with the sentiment "If only there were sleeves vast enough to cover the great sky."

Cherry blossoms—
to keep their many
fragrances from scattering,
are there sleeves
vast enough to cover them?

This is a lady-in-waiting from the same place. This poem was composed after she glimpsed the go match mentioned in the Chamberlain Minor Captain's section, and felt regret that the elder lady she favored had lost. Thinking that if she had been beside her offering advice, she could have made her win, she composed this reply poem: "Well now, for one of no account like myself, what I cannot accomplish must be due to a spirit of not wanting to lose to others." The heart of the poem is: "What an unreasonable thing to say! When victory and defeat depend on the strength or weakness of the players, how can it be influenced by another person's feelings alone?" "Warinashi" means "unreasonable" (without reason).

How unreasonable—
victory and defeat
that should depend on strength,
how can they be determined
by one person's feelings alone?

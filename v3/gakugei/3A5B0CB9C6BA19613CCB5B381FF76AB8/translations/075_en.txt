This person had set his heart on the New Emperor's Second Princess. However, when it was decided that she would be given to Kaoru, and on the day before the Second Princess was to be sent to Kaoru, he composed this poem during a wisteria banquet at Fujitsubo Palace. The heart of the poem is: "What an exceedingly fortunate person Kaoru is, chosen as son-in-law to the Emperor's cherished daughter, rising in status through what cannot be considered ordinary imperial favor." This sentiment is expressed through the metaphor of wisteria climbing up to high treetops. The poem contains feelings of jealousy.

Azechi no Dainagon
O wisteria blossoms,
climbing up
to the very clouds,
your color invisible—

Initially called Chūjō no Kimi, she served Ubasoku no Miya, gave birth to Princess Ukifune, and later became the wife of Hitachi no Suke. This poem was composed and directed at the Shōshō when his heart shifted and he decided on Hitachi no Suke's actual daughter instead, though she had intended to marry Princess Ukifune to the Shōshō. The heart of the poem is: "My child, who was promised, would never break faith, so how has your heart changed?" This sentiment is expressed through the metaphor of flowers remaining undisturbed while the lower leaves fade due to dew. "Shimeyū" means to possess or claim, referring here to what was promised.

Hitachi no Kitanokata
Though the upper part
of this bush clover
marked with sacred rope
does not waver,
by what dew
do these lower leaves
change color?

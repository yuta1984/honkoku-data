She was a lady-in-waiting to Murasaki no Ue. This poem was composed in response to poems by Murasaki no Ue ("The frost that settles deep at night on the pines of Sumie shore—are these the sacred streamers hung by the gods?") and Akashi Chūgū ("The frost of the deep night that clings to the sacred sakaki branches held in the hands of the shrine attendants, adding to their paper streamers") when Genji took his beloved ladies on a pilgrimage to Sumiyoshi. The meaning is that the frost that naturally settled, mingling with the paper streamers offered by the shrine priests, is indeed clear evidence of the gods' acceptance of their prayers. "Hafuriko" means shrine priest, and "ichijiruki" means "clearly evident."

Nakatsukasa no Kimi
The frost that settles,
mingling with the paper streamers
offered by the priests—
truly this is clear evidence
of the gods' divine sign.

She was a princess of Suzaku-in, the Third Princess. Her mother was Fujitsubo no Nyōgo, who was the younger sister of Usugumo Nyōin. In the Wakana chapter, she became Genji's consort and received the Second Rank; in the Kashiwagi chapter, she gave birth to Kaoru Daishō and later became a nun, residing at Sanjō-miya. This poem is her response to Genji's poem when she became a nun: "Having pledged to share the same lotus platform, how sad this day when we must part like morning dew." The meaning is that since she herself renounced the world due to her transgression of having a secret affair with Kashiwagi, even if they were to pledge to share the same lotus platform in the afterlife, his heart would probably not find peace with this arrangement.

Even if we pledge
without reserve to share
the lotus dwelling,
your heart would probably
not find this acceptable.

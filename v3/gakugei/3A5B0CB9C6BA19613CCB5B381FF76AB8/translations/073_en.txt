She is a court lady who first served at Uji Palace and later at Nijō-in (Second Avenue Palace). This poem was composed when the Middle Princess was welcomed by Prince Niou and moved to Nijō-in. The heart of the poem is: if one lives long in this world and observes it, one will encounter such joyful times as well. If I had despaired over my unfortunate circumstances up until now and thrown myself into a river, this joy would not have existed. This expresses the sentiment "if I had thought my life worthless and abandoned it." The word "u" (sorrow) is used as a pun on "Uji," and "joyful rapids" is also a river-related word association.

Living on,
I have encountered
even joyful rapids—
had I thrown
myself into
the Uji River

This is a poem composed by another court lady from the same place at the same time. The heart of the poem is: although I cannot forget my longing for the departed Princess Agemaki, today once again brings the wonderful departure ceremony of the Middle Princess, which lifts my spirits above all else. "Hata" has the same meaning as "mata" (again/also).

Though I cannot
forget my longing
for the one
who passed away,
today again
my heart moves
forward with joy

Some [explanations] were deliberately crafted so that the general outline of the entire Tale of Genji could be faintly traced and understood.

○The illustrations are intended to make [the work] familiar to children, so I had the artist draw the people's clothing and such in a general manner, but for the sake of knowledgeable readers, I will briefly explain the reasoning. Moreover, regarding calling this book "Genji Hundred Poems," while it actually contains one hundred twenty-three people's poems, which might seem inconsistent, this is simply to make it implicitly clear that these are generally poems from Genji, like the Ogura Hundred Poems.
For those who might find this strange, I also provide this explanation.

This is the emperor who was Prince Genji's father.
In the "Aoi" (Heartvine) chapter, he abdicated to
Suzaku-in, and in the "Sakaki" (Sacred Tree) chapter
he passed away. This poem was composed
by the Minister of the Left at the time of Genji's coming-of-age ceremony
and presented to the emperor, expressing
the minister's intention to make Genji the
son-in-law of his daughter, Lady Aoi.
The meaning is that during coming-of-age ceremonies, one's
hair is tied with purple braided cord—
this is called the "first motoyui" (hair-binding), so [the emperor asks]
whether there might be a heart that has bound
a long pledge for young children
with promising futures into today's
motoyui. He is inquiring about the minister's intentions.
"Itoki naki" is the same as "itoke naki,"
meaning young or childlike.

"The mountain on the turtle's back" refers to Mount Hōrai (the mythical mountain of immortals). This derives from a passage in the Book of Han stating "carried on a turtle's back." The meaning of the poem is: There is no need to seek out Mount Hōrai. In the delight of this boat, I forget my troubles and feel my heart grow young, so I will leave the name of immortality in this place. This alludes to the legend that while seeking Hōrai, a young boy aged within the boat, so she composes this to mean that within this boat, one does not grow old.

The mountain on turtle's back—
I shall not seek it out.
Within this boat
the name of agelessness
I leave here.

This poem describes the scene before her eyes now. When the spring sun shines gently and brightly, and they pole around the tranquil surface of the pond, even the droplets from the pole appear like falling flower petals—how beautiful it is. There is a wordplay on "sashi" (shine/pole) connecting "sun's rays" and "pole."

The spring sun
shining gently
as we go—
from our boat's pole
the droplets too
are falling flowers

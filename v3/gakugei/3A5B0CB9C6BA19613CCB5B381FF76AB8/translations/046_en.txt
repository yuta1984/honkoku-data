A prince of Emperor Kiritsubo and younger brother of Genji. Initially called Souchi-no-miya, he became Hyōbukyō (Minister of War) in the Otome chapter and passed away in the Kōbai chapter. This poem was composed as a love letter to Tamakazura. The meaning is as follows: Even the love of a firefly, which makes no sound, cannot be extinguished by outside interference. If such love cannot be extinguished, how much more difficult it is to stop a person's burning passion. The poem adds the element of fire to the emotion of love.

Even the feelings
of an insect that makes
no crying sound—
can they be extinguished
by human intervention?

Her father was Dazai-no-shōni (Assistant Governor-General of Dazaifu), her mother was Yūgao's wet nurse. After Yūgao died, she raised Tamakazura and went down to Tsukushi with her parents. Years later, when Tamakazura returned to the capital, she remained in that distant place. She is the elder sister of Shimo-no-hyōbu-no-kimi. This poem was composed when going down to Tsukushi, upon hearing the melancholy boat songs. The meaning is: Though I myself long for Yūgao with such yearning, whom does the boatman love that his voice sounds so heartbreakingly sad? Ōshima refers to Chikuzen Province. She makes a play on words with "Ōshima-no-ura" (Ōshima Bay). "Uraganashi" means heartbreaking or sorrowful.

Whom does the boatman
love, I wonder, that
at Ōshima Bay
his voice sounds
so sorrowfully?

The father is Higeguro and the mother is Tamakazura. He becomes Head Middle Captain (Tō-no-chūjō) in the Takekawa (Bamboo River) chapter. This poem is a response to a verse sent from Kaoru after an incident where Kaoru hurriedly departed when they were singing and playing the saibara song "Takekawa" one day. Kaoru had sent: "Did you truly understand the deep feelings behind that one verse when we sang of crossing Takekawa bridge?" The meaning of the response is: regarding your hurried departure that night when we sang Takekawa, saying you wouldn't stay late into the night—what kind of emotions were you harboring? There was no such indication at the time. This is an exchange of poems based on the saibara song that goes "At the edge of Takekawa bridge, in the flower garden, keep me close and don't let me go."

Tō-jijū (Fujiwara Chamberlain)
At Takekawa,
hurrying away
saying you wouldn't
stay late into the night—
what feelings did you harbor?

The father is Higeguro and the mother is Tamakazura. In the Takekawa chapter, she becomes Imperial Consort to Emperor Reizei and bears two princesses. This poem was composed when she was still at home, playing go with her sister princess, using the garden cherry blossoms as stakes, dividing into left and right sides, and she lost the game. The meaning is that whether losing or winning, although these are flowers we view without reserve, because I treasure these cherry blossoms, my heart is troubled by losing the go game. She expresses this by comparing it to how one's heart aches when the wind threatens to scatter the blossoms. "Omoi-guma naki" means having no hidden thoughts or barriers in one's heart.

Because of the cherry blossoms,
my heart is troubled
by the wind—
viewing these flowers
without hidden thoughts

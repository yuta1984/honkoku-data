He was the son of the former Governor of Harima, someone whom Genji employed with particular intimacy. Initially he was a Palace Attendant (kurōdo) and received his coming-of-age ceremony, in the "Akashi" chapter he became Minor Counselor (shō-nagon), in the "Miotsukushi" (Channel Buoys) chapter he became Assistant of the Quiver-Bearer (yugehi-no-suke), and in the "Otome" (The Maiden) chapter he became Middle Controller of the Right (u-chū-ben). This poem was composed at the same time as the poem above. The meaning is: although the wild geese are not friends from that era, seeing them brings back collected memories of past events. "Kakitsurane" means to string things together, similar to saying "to gather."

Stringing together,
memories of the past
come to mind—
though these geese
were not companions
of those days.

He left his position as Middle Captain of the Palace Guards (konoe-no-chūjō) to become Governor of Harima, eventually took Buddhist vows and lived at Akashi Bay. In old age, he withdrew deep into the mountains. This poem was composed in response when Genji, during his wandering at Suma, was told by the lay priest that his daughter might provide comfort for his solitary nights. The meaning is: you must now understand through your recent traveling nights the loneliness of spending sleepless nights alone with melancholy thoughts. He made Genji think of his daughter's solitary dwelling. "Ura-sabishi" means lonely at heart. The heart is called "ura," creating a wordplay with Akashi Bay (ura).

Do you now know
the loneliness of sleeping alone,
spending melancholy hours
thinking of
Akashi Bay's
desolate sadness?

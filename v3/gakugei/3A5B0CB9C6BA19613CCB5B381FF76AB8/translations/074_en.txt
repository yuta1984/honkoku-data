He is a prince of Emperor Suzaku, whose mother was Lady Shōkyōden, sister to Minister Higekkuro. He was made Crown Prince in the "Miwotsukushi" (Channel Buoys) chapter, came of age in the "Umegae" (Plum Blossoms) chapter, and ascended to the throne in the "Wakana" (Young Greens) chapter. This poem represents the Emperor's wish when he hinted to Kaoru about giving him the Second Princess as his wife, after the Second Princess's mother, Lady Fujitsubo, had passed away and the princess was living in lonely circumstances. The heart of the poem is: though the Second Princess was left behind by her mother, Lady Fujitsubo, who died unable to bear her illness, she remains and is in the prime of her years. This is expressed through the metaphor of chrysanthemums that bloom unfaded in a frost-withered garden. "Ahezu" means "taezu" (unable to endure). "Asezu" has the same meaning as "kasezu" (not fading).

The New Emperor
Though these are
chrysanthemums in a garden
that withered,
unable to bear the frost,
their remaining colors
do not fade

She is a court lady of Sanjō Palace and Kaoru's beloved. This poem was composed in resentment when Kaoru departed late at night. The heart of the poem is: though we are in a relationship where we are only allowed to see each other and not meet intimately, others would say we are behaving as if we were familiar lovers, and it is only this reputation that I regret. This sentiment is expressed through reference to the stream at Osaka Barrier. "Uchiwatashi" has the same meaning as "miwatashi" (looking across). "Minare" (familiar sight) is paired with "mizunare" (familiar with water).

Looking across
this barrier stream
that the world
will not permit,
how regrettable is the reputation
of having grown familiar
with its sight

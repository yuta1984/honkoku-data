Kaoru is the son of Genji, and his mother is the Third Princess, daughter of Emperor Suzaku. He was born in the Wakana (Young Herbs) chapter, came of age in the Niou no Miya (The Perfumed Prince) chapter becoming a Fourth Rank Chamberlain, and gradually rose in rank to become Acting Major Counselor and Right General in the Yadorigi (The Mistletoe) chapter. This poem was composed when he was moved to melancholy by the scenery along the road while going to pay his respects at the Uji Palace. The heart of the poem is: "The dew placed on the fragile leaves that scatter, unable to withstand the wind blowing down from the mountains, is very fragile indeed, but even more fragile than that are my tears that spill for no reason at all." "Ayanaku" means "for no reason" in common parlance.

More fragile than the dew
on leaves that cannot
withstand the mountain wind—
my tears that fall
for no reason at all

This is a lady-in-waiting of Tamakazura who later accompanied the elder lady who lost at go to serve at the Reizei Palace. This poem was composed when she addressed Kaoru as he came to the palace during the men's ceremonial dance, singing "Takegawa." The heart of the poem is: "Do you remember that night when you previously played and sang 'Takegawa' with the Chamberlain Tō at Tamakazura's residence? Of course, it was not an intimate relationship that required secrecy." At that time, Kaoru had also set his heart on this elder lady, but now that she has become an imperial consort and his efforts have come to naught, she speaks thus in connection with today's singing of "Takegawa" once again.

Do you recall
that night
of Takegawa—
though there were no moments
requiring secrecy

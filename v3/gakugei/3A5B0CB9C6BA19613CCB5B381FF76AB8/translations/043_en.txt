He was a prince of Emperor Kiritsubo and the younger brother of Genji. His mother was called Empress Usugumo (Thin Clouds). He was born in the Momiji-no-ga (Autumn Leaves) chapter, became Crown Prince in the Aoi chapter, ascended to the throne in the Miotsukushi chapter, and abdicated by passing the throne to the Crown Prince in the Wakana chapter. This poem was composed when he enviously thought of Genji enjoying moon-viewing at Katsura-no-in and sent it to him. The meaning is an indirect way of saying that since it is a village on the far side of the Katsura River, the moonlight must surely be peaceful there. From the Chinese text stating "there is a katsura tree in the moon," expressions like "moon's katsura" have become common. Here he plays on the place name Katsura, making an allusion to this tradition.

Reizei-in (Emperor Reizei)
In the village
beyond the river
where the moon is clear,
the shadow of the katsura
must be peaceful indeed.

This person rode in the same carriage when Genji went to Katsura-no-in. This poem was composed at the same villa during a moon-viewing banquet when they recalled Suma Bay, as a response to Genji's poem: "Coming full circle, so clear I could take it in my hands—the moon I saw as 'awa' over Awaji Island." The meaning is that although he was temporarily moved to Suma due to worldly turmoil, since his return to the capital vindicated him completely, the future of his reign will surely be peaceful. This celebrates Genji by comparing him to the moon.

Tō-no-chūjō (Captain of the Right)
The moonlight that
briefly hid among
the sorrowful clouds—
the world where it shines clear
will surely be peaceful.

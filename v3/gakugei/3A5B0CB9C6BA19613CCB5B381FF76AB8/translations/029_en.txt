This is Lady Murasaki's wet nurse, who was later entrusted with various affairs in the capital when Genji was exiled to Suma. This poem was composed immediately as a reply after hearing the above nun's poem with deep emotion. The meaning is: while Lady Murasaki's future is still unknown, why do you think so weakly of dying? It contains the sentiment of asking her to maintain a strong heart and recover properly. "Hatsukusa" (new grass) has the same meaning as "wakakusa" (young grass).

How can the dew
think to vanish
while the future of
the growing new grass
remains unknown?

He is the brother of the Kitayama nun and the uncle of Lady Murasaki's mother. This poem is a reply to Genji's verse when he visited Kitayama for prayers to cure his ague (malaria), where he admired the mountain flowers and composed: "I should go tell the court people - mountain cherry blossoms that should be seen before the wind arrives." The meaning is: it feels as though I have been able to witness the udumbara flower, which is said to bloom once in three thousand years, in present reality, so my eyes do not turn to such remote cherry blossoms. He compared Genji to the udumbara flower, expressing joy at his visit to the mountain. The udumbara flower, also called the auspicious flower, is a tree that bears fruit but has no flowers.

With the feeling
of having waited and found
the udumbara flower,
my eyes do not turn
to the deep mountain cherry.

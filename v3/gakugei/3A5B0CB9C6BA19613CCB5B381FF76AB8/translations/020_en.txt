A prince of Emperor Kiritsubo, whose mother was Lady Kiritsubo. At the age of seven, he was granted the surname Genji, and at twelve he came of age. Beginning with his appointment as Middle Captain of the Inner Palace Guards in the "Hahakigi" (Broom Tree) chapter (hahaki is the vulgar form of the character), he successively held many court ranks and positions, becoming Chancellor in the "Otome" (Maidens) chapter, and in the "Fuji no Uraba" (Wisteria Leaves) chapter, he was honored with a title comparable to Retired Emperor and became known as Rokujō-in. This poem was composed on the night he secretly visited Utsusemi, at the moment of parting. The meaning is: the woman's coldness prevented him from even finishing expressing his resentment, and already the time had come to part hastily, which the rooster announces. There is a wordplay between "toriahenu" (cannot manage) and "tori" (bird/rooster). "Shononome" refers to drowsy eyes blinking frequently, meaning dawn [according to an alternative text].

Your coldness—
my resentment unfinished
at dawn
the bird startles us
before we can manage

This is the person who became an expert on evaluating women during Genji's rainy night conversations. This poem was composed when he was trying to separate from a jealous woman he had grown to dislike, and when the woman bit his finger in resentment, he became angry and left her. The meaning is: counting on his fingers the painful incidents during their meetings, was this the only time? No, it was not just this once. He uses the metaphor "folding fingers" (to count) in reference to having his finger bitten.

Folding my fingers
to count the times
we have met—
is this just one
of your painful moments?

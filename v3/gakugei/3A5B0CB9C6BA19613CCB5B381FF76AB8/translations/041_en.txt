She was a court lady of the imperial palace. This poem was composed during a picture contest (e-awase) when Akikonomu Chūgū (Empress) and Kokiden-no-nyōgo (Imperial Consort) divided into left and right sides. This court lady served the left side of Akikonomu's faction, and composed this when the left side presented the Ise Monogatari (Tales of Ise) against the right side's Shōsanmi (a tale). The meaning is: how could it be acceptable to criticize something as merely old-fashioned without exploring the deep essence of the Tales of Ise? This was her retort when the right side argued that it was antiquated. Playing on the name "Ise," she speaks of the sea and also of waves.

Hei-naishi (Court Lady Hei)
Without tracing
the deep heart
of Ise's sea,
should the waves erase
the tracks of what has passed?

This was also a court lady of the imperial palace who, at the same time, served the right side of Kokiden's faction and composed this as a reply to the above poem. The meaning is: from a heart that has risen high in arrogance to the clouds above, even the thousand-fathom-deep bottom of Ise's sea appears far below. She looked down upon the Tales of Ise. Shōsanmi was an ancient tale not transmitted to the present world. It probably contained episodes of ascending to the clouds above.

To a heart that has
thought to climb
above the clouds,
even the thousand-fathom depths
appear distant below.

She was the daughter of Minister Nijō and younger sister of Empress Kōkiden. In the "Aoi" chapter, she entered service at Suzaku-in as Mikushige-dono, and in the "Sakaki" chapter became Naishi-no-kami (Chief Inner Palace Attendant). This poem was composed in response to Genji's request that she give her name so he might send messages after their first meeting. The meaning is: if I should die as I am now and be hidden beneath the grass, would you not think to visit and mourn at that grassy field? She reproached him, asking if he would abandon her completely if she did not reveal her name.

Oborozukiyo Naishi-no-kami (Lady Oborozukiyo, Chief Inner Palace Attendant)
If this floating life
should vanish away,
would you think to seek
even in the grassy fields
where I might lie?

He was the maternal grandfather of Suzaku-in and father of Oborozukiyo. In the "Sakaki" chapter he became Prime Minister (Daijō-daijin), and in the "Akashi" chapter he passed away. This poem was sent with a messenger when he had promised Genji early on to hold a flower viewing party at his residence, but when Genji did not come, he sent someone to fetch him. The meaning is: if the flowers at my residence were merely of ordinary, common beauty, why would I insist on your presence? It is precisely because they are exceptionally beautiful flowers that I await you.

Nijō Prime Minister
The flowers of my garden—
if they were of ordinary hue,
why should I
wait for you
any longer?

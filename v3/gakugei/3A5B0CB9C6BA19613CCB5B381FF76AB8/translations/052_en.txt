His father was the Retired Minister, and his mother was the daughter of the Nijō Minister. Beginning with his appearance as Left Palace Guard Minor Captain in the "Otome" (Maiden) chapter, he was promoted successively and became Provisional Major Counselor in the "Kashiwagi" chapter before dying. This poem was sent to the Third Princess as his death poem. The meaning is: Even though I become a body that vanishes into the sky like funeral pyre smoke with no destination, my soul will remain and never leave your vicinity.

Kashiwagi, Right Gate Guard Commander
Though I become
smoke in the sky
with nowhere to go,
I will not depart
from where my heart dwells.

His father was the Retired Minister, and he was Kashiwagi's younger brother by the same mother. He appears as Minor Captain Ben in the "Hatsune" (First Warbler) chapter and eventually becomes Right Minister and Right Palace Guard General in the "Takekawa" (Bamboo River) chapter. This poem was composed in grief over the death of his elder brother Kashiwagi. The meaning is: How resentful it is! Who was told to wear mourning robes of ink-black? Without waiting for his destined lifespan, he died in the prime of life. He plays on "robes of mist" and "robes of ink." Those in mourning wear what is called "dull color"—black-gray robes. This is called "ink-dyed."

Kōbai, Right Minister
How resentful—
robes of mist,
who was told to wear them?
Before spring came,
the flowers scattered.

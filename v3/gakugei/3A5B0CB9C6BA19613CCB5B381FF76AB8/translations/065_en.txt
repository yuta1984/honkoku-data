This is a lady-in-waiting from the same place who was a supporter of the winning side during the same match. The heart of the poem is that the cherry blossoms also have feelings, and because the right side won this time, she says to the flowers falling on the right side of the pond: "Even if you become foam on the water, you should still flow toward our side." She speaks as if giving instructions to the flowers, making the losing side feel envious. There is a wordplay between "migiwа" (water's edge) and "migi" (right).

With feeling,
flowers falling
at the pond's edge—
even becoming foam,
come to our side

This is a young girl who likewise supported the right side as an ally. This is a poem she composed after gathering flowers that had scattered in the garden. The heart of the poem is that although the flowers scattered in the wind blowing through the sky, since those scattered flowers also belong to our side, she gathers them up like this and admires them with celebration.

The Winning Side's Young Girl
Though scattered
by the wind
of the great sky,
these cherry blossoms—
as my own things
I gather and view them

Hirakawa Tenman-gū: Located in Hirakawa-chō, south of Kōjimachi 3-chōme, west of the castle. The managing temple is of the Tendai sect, called Chōshōzan Ryūgen-ji, and belongs to Tōeizan.

According to tradition, this shrine was established on June 25, Bunmei 10 (1478), when Ōta Mochisuke invited the Tenjin deity from Miyoshino in Kawagoe, Iruma District of this province, to Edo Castle, and planted several plum trees. {{Note: What is now called Bairinzaka (Plum Grove Slope) within the castle grounds is the old site of that plum grove. The Shin'an Shukan records that in the document for the ridge-raising ceremony of Kanshin shrine in Hirakawaguchi of Edo Castle built by Ōta Dōkan during the Bunmei era, it states June 25, Bunmei 10.}}

Later, around Tenshō 18 (1590) when [Tokugawa] entered the province, that shrine was moved outside Hirakawaguchi. {{Note: Elder Yūzan says that when [Tokugawa] entered Edo, it was moved from Hirakawa to Kaizuka, hence it was also called the Tenjin of Kaizuka.}} Therefore it is called Hirakawa Tenjin. {{Note: For this reason, even when moved to the present Kōjimachi area, the old name was not changed, and the town near the shrine is still called Hirakawa-chō.}}

Later, during the Keichō era when the main keep was being constructed, the location was finally changed to present-day Kōjimachi. {{Extended notes about the various relocations and the incorporation of Yakushi-dō and Hachiman shrine into the Tenman-gū grounds follow...}}

The Chinese text includes poems about plum blossoms, the shrine's beauty, and philosophical reflections on the shrine's significance.]

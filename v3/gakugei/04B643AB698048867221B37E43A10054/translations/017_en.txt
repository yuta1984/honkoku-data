The "Musashino Place Name Study" states that according to an ancient record: "Kasumigaseki in Ebara District was a barrier post prepared by Prince Yamato Takeru against the Emishi. Since then it has been continuously maintained as a great installation and has become a scenic spot of the province. Because its distant view is separated by clouds and mist, it is called Kasumigaseki (Mist Barrier)."

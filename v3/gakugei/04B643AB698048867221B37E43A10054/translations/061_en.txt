Chiyogasaki (Chiyo Cape)
　North of Gyōnin-zaka slope, behind the villa of Nagamine Matsudaira Tonomo-no-kami, this is a place that descends slightly toward Meguro. Originally called Yarigasaki (Spear Cape), it was later renamed Chiyogasaki. This is the former site of Tonomo-no-kami's estate, and beside the pond stands a pine tree called Kinukake-matsu (Robe-hanging Pine). It is said that when the wife of Nitta Yoshioki heard that Yoshioki had met his end at Yaguchi-no-watashi ferry, she was overcome with grief and threw herself into this pond. "Zekkeikan" (Superb View Pavilion) is also said to be the name of this villa.

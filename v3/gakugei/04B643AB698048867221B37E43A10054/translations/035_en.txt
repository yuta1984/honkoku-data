Plum Blossom Tea House (Ume-ga-chaya)
Located to the left of Sankō Slope, beside Shirogane Hikawa Shrine. The traveling monk Taa Ikkai, the 52nd successor in the lineage of Saint Ippen's pilgrimage tradition, loved the plum trees of this house and composed a waka poem about them. The white plum blossoms are called "toko-ume" (alcove plums). Their fragrance in the second month (March) is exceptionally superior and renowned throughout the world.

Fujimi Tea House (Fujimi Chaya)
Opening up far to the southwest, one can view the white peak of Mount Fuji. Sweeping away wind and clouds, just when it seems to reveal the true colors of deep winter, it suddenly loses its form again. Within moments it changes constantly, sometimes altering its view. It is truly a splendid景.

【Continuation of Gohyaku Rakan Zen Temple】
He traveled westward to the sea and reached Rakan-ji Temple in Buzen Province, where he worshipped the stone statues of the five hundred saints, said to have been created in one night by two monks named Gyakuryu of Mount Tiantai in Tang China and Kenjun. His reverence deepened day by day. Afterwards, he secretly harbored the intention to hand-carve images of the five hundred arhats. On the day of his return home, Zen Master Tetsugen indeed gave him this command, so he finally came to Edo during the Jōkyō era. In the year Genroku Kanoe-Hitsuji (1691), he first set up a temporary building at Jushō-in within the precincts of Sensoji Temple, encouraging people to carve wooden images of arhats. The monk Tetsugyū of Kōfuku-ji Temple gladly donated money for clothing and had one statue carved, but as the time had not yet come, donations were few, and many months and years passed. However, in the same Mizunoe-Saru year, sixteen monks and laypeople from Ōkura-mae formed an alliance to assist. By the first month of Mizunoto-Tori year, fifty statues were completed, and in the third month of Kinoe-Inu year, Her Majesty the Queen Mother Keishō Ichii graciously bestowed gold to serve as funds for creating Buddhist statues. At this time, ten statues were carved. From this point on, as if spiritual connections responded like echoes, donations increased daily, and finally, after more than ten years, the main image of the 16-foot Shakyamuni Buddha and arhats - over 503 Buddhist statues in total - appeared mysteriously like floating clouds.

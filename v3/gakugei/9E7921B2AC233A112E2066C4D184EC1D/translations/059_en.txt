A dragon—
Plum blossoms

During the peak blooming season in Kisaragi (February), the beauty deceives even the remaining snow, and the lingering fragrance spreads fragrantly in all directions. After the flowers, they gather the fruit that forms, dry it in the sun, and constantly sell it as salt-pickled preserves. The taste is especially sweet and delicious, so visitors to this place invariably buy some as souvenirs to take home.

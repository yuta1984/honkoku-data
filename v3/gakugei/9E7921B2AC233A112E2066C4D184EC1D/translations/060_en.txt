[Continuation of Tōkaku-ji Temple]
The upāsaka (lay devotee) at the inn heard this and came forward, saying, "This must be where the Fudō-son (Acala) enshrined in my backpack box has administered punishment." He immediately knelt before the backpack and earnestly prayed. Mysteriously, the robust man (robber) regained the freedom of his body. At this point he was able to speak, greatly rejoiced, confessed to being a bandit, apologized for his crimes, and promised to permanently return to righteousness before departing. The hōin (Gengaku) considered this miraculous and inquired about the origin of the principal image. The upāsaka replied: "Long ago, when the monk Rōben established Ōyama in Sagami Province, my ancestor lived in Koyasu village at its foot. At that time, he served the monk, opened the path ahead, and enabled the monk to reach the summit. This was the founding of Ōyama-ji Temple in Sagami Province. The reverend monk, in gratitude for the service of accompaniment, entrusted this principal image to my ancestor, saying: 'The great afflictions of the human realm are none other than theft and sword calamities. If you protect this sacred image, your descendants and all those who encounter it through karmic connection will forever escape such disasters.' Since then it has been transmitted in my family for twenty-five generations to this day. During pilgrimages, we have frequently escaped dangers on the road, all due to the protective response of this sacred image." The hōin was deeply moved and wished to permanently enshrine this sacred image in this location, build a temple hall, and widely connect all sentient beings to it, so he earnestly requested the sacred image. The upāsaka finally agreed to his intention and bestowed the sacred statue upon Gengaku. Gengaku immediately built an incense hall and enshrined this sacred image there. This is the current temple. Therefore, people respectfully call it the "Theft-Protection Fudō-son."

Katori Grand Shrine: Located about two chō northwest of the same place. This area was also formerly sea like Taihei-tsu, forming a separate island. Because it resembled a floating turtle, it was formerly called Kametsu-shima (Turtle Harbor Island).

Main Shrine: The enshrined deity is Futsunushi-no-mikoto (the divine body from Shimōsa Ichinomiya). In the joint shrine are three deities: Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto (from Kashima Grand Shrine) and Sarutahiko-no-mikoto (from Ōsugi Grand Shrine).

This shrine is said to be an invocation from the founding of Kameido village and the foremost historical site in this area. According to one theory, this shrine was invoked by Taishokuwan Kamatari. The annual festival is held on June 14th and 15th each year. The temporary shrine is located in the rice fields about twenty to thirty paces east of Azuma-no-mori. In ancient times...

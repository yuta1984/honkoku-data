There was construction and it was called Shararen-zan Sekiho-ji Temple, where this principal Buddha image was enshrined. Later, around the Bun'ei era, it was caught in war fires and all the temple buildings were completely burned down. Therefore, the monks of the entire mountain grieved over this and enshrined this principal Buddha image in a stone box, burying it in the mountains. After that, many years passed, and in the first year of Keicho, the local people dug up this stone box at Mount Shara. The lid bore the inscription "Shararen-zan Sekiho-ji Yakushi," and the local people found this mysterious, immediately building a small temple to enshrine it. In the eighth year of the same era, the principal Buddha image revealed something to the hermitage master named Sogen, and it was temporarily enshrined at Inaba Hall in Gojo in the capital, and later a temple building was constructed near Wakamiya Hachiman Shrine to the east of the Gojo bridge approach, called Sekiho-ji. Around the Hoei era, that temple was moved to Fukakusa by the Obaku Zen master Senpai. At that time, for certain reasons, the principal Buddha image, the Yakushi Buddha, was enshrined at this temple.

Shoho-zan Honkyu-ji Temple is located in Kita-Honjo Omote-machi, belongs to the Nichiren sect, and is affiliated with Hiraga Hondo-ji Temple. It was established in the third year of Tensho, year of the Metal Boar, and its founding priest was Superior Nichiu of Shogan-in.

Many sacred Buddhist statues and Shinto deities from various provinces come to Edo to hold special exhibitions (kaichō) for the purpose of forming spiritual connections with worshippers, and most of them allow people to worship at this temple (Ekōin). Because it is conveniently located and accessible from all directions, it attracts particularly large numbers of pilgrims.

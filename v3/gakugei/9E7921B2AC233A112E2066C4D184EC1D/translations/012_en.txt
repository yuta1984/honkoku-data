This place is a beautiful location in the southeast of Edo, where among the many scenic delights of the four seasons with moon and flowers, especially during the first snowfall and such times, the refined people of the capital would gather here. They would appreciate the quiet and tranquil atmosphere of the tea houses, sharing cups of sake, and in their drunken revelry, beneath the winter-dormant plum trees—or in autumn, spreading cut pampas grass—they would likely often spend the night in dreams.

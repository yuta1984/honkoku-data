The statue was personally created by Prince Shotoku himself when he was sixteen years old. This temple was founded during the Kasho era (848-851) of Emperor Junna, when the Great Master Jikaku was traveling and teaching in the eastern provinces, and the Emperor donated one hundred tan of paddy fields. During the Tenbun era (1532-1555), when this area was struck by fire, the sacred image of the Prince miraculously escaped the flames on its own and remained unharmed, as recorded in the "Edo Meisho Hanashi" (Tales of Famous Places in Edo).

○The fox resembles a dog
with a pointed nose and large tail.
It hides during the day
and comes out at night. When it holds
a horse bone in its mouth and blows, it emits light
to search for food. This
is called fox-fire. It is also said
that it holds a jewel in its mouth
to produce light. It is said that after
living a hundred years,
it worships the Big Dipper and transforms.

○The cat's pupils become
thread-like during the hours of rat, horse, rabbit, and
rooster; they become like a full moon
during tiger, monkey, snake, and boar hours;
and like date pits during ox, sheep, dragon, and dog hours.
The nose is always cold, but becomes
warm on the day of summer solstice.

○Among raccoon dogs, there are tiger-raccoons
and cat-raccoons. Cat-raccoons are smelly
and should not be eaten. Those with pointed heads
and square mouths are called tiger-raccoons.

○The badger resembles
foxes and raccoons. Its fur is yellow
and brown in color.
It sleeps well, lies down during the day
and comes out at night.

○The Asian badger resembles a dog with a pointed
snout, black feet, and brown
fur. Its tail and legs are short,
and it walks slowly. Its ears
are deaf and it fears humans.

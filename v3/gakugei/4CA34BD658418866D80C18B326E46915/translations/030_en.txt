○The Suijaku (azure finch) is also called Suichou (azure bird).
Its form is about the size of a sparrow,
with both head and back
gleaming in azure color,
making it a beautiful bird.
There is also one called Charuri.
○The Roushi (hawfinch) is also called Setsushi (fat-stealer).
Its form is about the size of a bulbul,
with a thick, yellow beak.
There is also a bird called Shime
with the same form as the hawfinch,
but with a light red beak.
○The Uhou (azure-winged magpie) has an entirely black body
with a long tail. It is also called
Oubo-chou (Queen Mother bird).
○The Jaku (sparrow) has a head like a garlic bulb
and eyes like peppercorn seeds.
Its nature is extremely libidinous.
When consumed, it invigorates yang energy,
increases vitality,
warms the lower back and knees, suppresses
urination, and treats uterine bleeding
and vaginal discharge. The head should not
be eaten as it causes sores to develop.

are sometimes named by

famous hawks all have special
names. Moreover, hawks that came
from foreign countries have different
varieties in particular.
Chinese hawks, Korean, Southern Barbarian,
Ryukyu, and in Japan too: Eastern provinces,
Western provinces, Northern provinces, Shikoku, Chugoku,

feathers number twenty-four per wing,
forty-eight feathers total for both wings,
and twelve tail feathers.
Each has a name.

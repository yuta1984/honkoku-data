○Hawk is a general term, with many
varieties of different sizes, and they are
fierce birds. They are also
used in hunting to catch
various birds. This practice
dates back to ancient times when
during the reign of Empress Jingu,
hawks were first
presented as tribute from Baekje.
Since then, hawks have been
cherished by generations of rulers.
Korean hawks are considered
the finest.
○The falcon is among the hawks
a sharp one. Its form is also
large, about the size of a kite,
so it catches large birds
like pheasants, wild geese, and ducks.
For cranes and such,
they use two falcons together.
The same applies to jun.
○The sparrowhawk is a small type
of hawk. The small sparrowhawk is called
konori, and an even smaller one is called
tsumitaka. Since they are all
small in form, they catch small birds.

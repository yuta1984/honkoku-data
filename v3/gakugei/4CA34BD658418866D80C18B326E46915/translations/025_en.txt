○The Uzura (quail) is about the size
of a bulbul with a round shape.
Its entire body has fine
spots. There are two
varieties: reddish-brown and blackish-brown. At the end of autumn
it sings. People appreciate
this voice and often keep them
in cages. They prefer to eat
millet. When roasted and eaten, they
supplement the five
organs and strengthen the body.
○The Tojukei (turkey) is the size of a chicken.
Its head resembles
a pheasant. The feather color is black-yellow
with star-like patterns. It has a
pouch on its neck that contains a fleshy ornament.
When the weather is fine and pleasant, it
extends this pouch to play.
○The Sanjaku (mountain magpie) is like
a magpie but black in color with beautiful patterns.
Its beak is red and tail is long,
but it cannot
fly far distances.

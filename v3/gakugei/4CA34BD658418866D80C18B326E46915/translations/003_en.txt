○The lion is the king
of all beasts.
It can run
five hundred ri in one day.
It catches and
eats tigers and leopards,
therefore
even tigers and leopards
greatly
fear the lion.
It is a fierce beast
of Tenjiku (India)
that possesses supernatural powers
and abilities,
it is said.
It is also called
Shungei.

○The Kaichi (Xiezhi) is
a beast from
foreign lands. Its form
resembles a lion
with one horn. It is also called

It can well distinguish
right from wrong. When Gao Yao
administered justice,
those whose guilt was
in doubt were subjected
to the Kaichi.
It eats those
who are guilty, but does not
eat the innocent.

○The Hibari (skylark) is also called Koujaku (artemisia sparrow).
It is slightly larger than
a sparrow, brown in color with spots.
From the beginning of March until around
the summer solstice, it rises into the sky and
sings. It raises the spirit and supplements
vital essence.
○The Kiji (pheasant): the male has beautiful plumage
and a long tail. The female is brown
with spots. When spring weather
arrives, it calls out. It can be eaten from September
to November.
○The Renjaku (waxwing) comes in two varieties:
those with long tails and those with short ones. In size
they are smaller than bulbuls,
black and brown in color, with white
feathers on the tail that look like
a braided sash.
○The Shitodo (bunting) is about the size
of a sparrow, light blue with slight
spots. It comes in the winter months. Commonly
called Aoji. When this bird is
made into charcoal powder and applied to swellings,
it serves as an excellent medicine.

○The Uguisu (Japanese bush warbler) has light blue plumage.
After Risshun (beginning of spring), it begins
to sing, its voice responding to the spring
sunshine.
○The Misosazai (winter wren) is smaller than
a sparrow, reddish-black with black
spots. It comes during the cold season and snowy weather.
It is not present in summer.
○The Hitaki (flycatcher) comes in winter. The Yuki-
hitaki (snow flycatcher) has blue, gleaming
plumage. The Jou-
hitaki has birch-colored feathers mixed with black
ones.
○The Yamadori (copper pheasant) resembles
a pheasant but is slightly smaller
with a long tail and yellow-
red plumage. It lives in the mountains.
When the Tekichi (a type of pheasant) is roasted and
eaten, it nourishes the body
and increases vitality.
○The Teratsutuki (woodpecker): the small ones are like
sparrows, while the large ones are about the size
of a bulbul. The lower belly is red, the beak is
like an awl, and it pecks wood to
bore holes and eat insects.

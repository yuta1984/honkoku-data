When there are mistakes, immediately correct them
　and speak reasonably, do not make excuses out of spite
Though young, regarding the conduct of men and women
　be upright, this is essential
Brothers and sisters should just be harmonious and affectionate
　this is direct filial piety toward parents
Though young, know well the feelings of things
　and deepen your heart of compassion for people
Do not spend today in vain amusement
　when you have free time, copy down teachings and read kana texts

Learning commerce well is more than money—
　know it as the capital for entering a shop
If you want to advance in the world, discipline yourself
　and turn your heart only to good things
Even if hated by senior clerks, in confidential
　matters, firmly speak with reason
Whatever people ask of you, if it involves
　hiding things from your master, firmly refuse to undertake it
Know that valuing service above all else
　is filial piety toward your own parents

On the Origin of the Writing Brush
It is said that the writing brush models the finger of Manjushri Bodhisattva. The length of the shaft is said to be four sun and two bu. The shape of the brush models a fingernail. In ancient times, people carved wood to write characters, so it was also called nyūfu, nyūboku, or bokuhitsu.

In the Heki'anshō it says: The inkstone models the eye of Manjushri Bodhisattva, so one should not carelessly write things on the surface of the inkstone. Also, the grinding well of the inkstone is called "sea" because it compares the vastness of Manjushri Bodhisattva's eye of wisdom to the sea.

An ancient poem:
Raising only false names
　without actually meeting—
Did someone blow away the dust on the inkstone?

In China they call it Bōhōshu, or Hōgaken, Hōjiken, etc. Generally, it is said that inkstones cut in the shape of wind are good.

【Text within the inkstone】
Just rub close to good people
　and become intimate with them
Do not let yourself be stained black
　by bad friends

Now, the practice of calligraphy learning in this country is quite similar to what is said in China about entering elementary school at age eight, and it is generally practiced from around age eight or nine under a teacher until around ten-odd years of age. Once that age passes, everyone has their respective family occupations and must attend to them, so their spare time becomes limited. Even if they regret not having learned things in their youth, there will be no days to learn again with such dedication. Moreover, ancient sages have warned that even though parents guide and teachers instruct, if one does not master the way, it is the child's fault. Therefore, children should diligently study and learn without negligence during the time when they cannot yet engage in productive work and are merely playing idly.

🎵 In this world, not writing the characters one should write means lacking in affairs and lacking in dignity

As this poem indicates, both I and others alike dislike calligraphy practice in our youth, not knowing that later we will suffer inconvenience, lacking in affairs and lacking in dignity. We want to make excuses and neglect calligraphy practice no matter what. When parents see this slackening of resolve, they deliberately become angry and raise the compassionate whip. Though we may have resented this in our childish hearts, now that we have reached this point, even if we bite our navels in regret, it cannot be undone. Therefore, young people should promptly follow good teachers even for a single day, diligently practice calligraphy, work hard at reading, practice the abacus without neglect, and listen to teachings about the human way. This is filial piety in youth, and it is the foundation for cultivating oneself and ordering one's household in adulthood without shame or deficiency. Therefore, one should study and strive diligently from a young age.

Ono no Michikaze (Tōfū) said: "To excel in calligraphy, one does not seek beyond the master's heart. Simply practice directly day after day, and naturally understanding will come. There is no method of knowing through transmission from the beginning. When a person attains sincerity in their heart and seeks to understand the space between heaven and earth, nothing is difficult to know. Outside of sincerity, there is nothing unequal in the space between heaven and earth."

Explanation of the Character for Filial Piety (孝)
In the "Canon of Shun," it states that among the three thousand crimes belonging to the five punishments, none is greater than unfilial conduct, as Confucius proclaimed. That one who yearns for their parents even at age fifty is praised as being like Shun is indeed true. Those who respect their parents will never hate others; those who respect their parents will never despise others. When one filial piety is established, what evil could possibly exist? From west, east, north, and south, all think and submit without exception, as stated in the "Transmission of Yousheng." In truth, when each person fully develops their single thought of filial piety and fraternal love and reaches its ultimate perfection, they connect deeply with the divine and clearly illuminate all within the four seas. Truly, it is fitting that filial piety is called the source of a hundred virtuous acts.

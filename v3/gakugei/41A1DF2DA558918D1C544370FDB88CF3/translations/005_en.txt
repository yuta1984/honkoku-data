Preface

An ancient saying states: "Teach a child in its infancy; teach a wife when she first arrives." Therefore, I believe that raising a human child should be like cultivating a tree. When cultivating a tree, if from the time when it has not yet reached two feet in height, one trains the drooping of branches and the thinning of leaves, gradually shaping it, then even after it becomes a large tree of several feet, its branch formation will remain unchanged, and as the years pass, it will become increasingly interesting and loveable. However, if one neglects it during the time when it should be shaped, and then tries to straighten and bend it after it has become a large tree, how could this possibly go as one wishes? With people too, if one does not teach and train them in childhood, attempting to add moral instruction after they have reached adulthood is the same as trying to straighten a large tree. Therefore, the essential point of child-rearing is to have them study the Way during their tender years, not let them be exposed to bad influences, and allow them to become accustomed to seeing and hearing good things. I have collected various teachings that I heard from friends, titled them "Children's Nurturing Grass" (Dōji Buikusō), and recorded them for the benefit of my own children and disciples.

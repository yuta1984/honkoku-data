Those who employ servants, treat me as my parents
　would mercifully care for me
Rather than treating harshly those you employ
　do not show favoritism
The habit of sleeping late and rising early—
　learn this as discipline, it is a lifelong virtue
Rather than just sitting idle, applying oneself to practice
　immediately becomes medicine for the body
Knowing that carelessness causes injuries and mistakes
　do things calmly
A child's single accomplishment is in eating
　without being base and not telling lies

【Lower Right Page】
Be on good terms with colleagues, and show mercy
　to those below you
When you have time, send letters to parents in your hometown
　to let them know you are serving safely
Though you may pass by your parents' gate, if there's no business
　not stopping is better service than stopping
When you go home on holidays, return immediately without staying
　lingering will surely cause worry
Work and serve by yourself, without
　deferring here and there to colleagues
Each time you eat a meal, if you taste it appreciatively
　you'll see it's all through your master's benevolence

【Upper Left Page】
Being cautious that short temper destroys oneself
　do not give rise to irritability or willfulness
When going out, tell your parents your destination
　and even your route before going
Though young, distinguish right from wrong very well
　and do not speak unreasonably or selfishly
Other skills you may not know and still get by, but what you cannot
　get by without knowing is your own family trade
Put your heart into it, and beyond that, put your heart
　into learning your own occupation
Do not indulge preferences in food or clothing
　for this is the root of downfall

【Lower Left Page】
Apply moxa, moderate your eating, stay healthy while
　showing loyalty to your master and filial piety to parents
Sweeping and cleaning, etiquette, serving meals—in all things
　do not be slovenly but keep things pure and orderly
Endurance and patience are the secret teachings
　for completing service well
Acting clever, being talkative, stubbornness,
　short temper, unreliability, lying—never do these even pretending
Not only skipping duties to watch theater
　but returning and lying to your master to cover up
If you are honest and gentle, both your master
　and colleagues will show you affection

○Sima Wenggong (Sima Guang)
Sima Wenggong loved learning
from his early childhood, and would read
books continuously from night
into day. When he would rest
briefly, he would lie down using
a round log as his pillow,
so when he would doze off
slightly, the pillow would immediately roll
away, naturally causing him to
awaken. When he awoke,
he would joyfully get up and again look at
his books. Because he had
such fervent dedication from
his youth, he eventually rose to high office

and left behind the good reputation of virtuous conduct
for a thousand years. Also, this
log pillow was named the "warning pillow,"
showing that he maintained deep
prudence even while sleeping.

Sima Wenggong said: "Even if you accumulate gold
to leave to your descendants, your descendants
may not necessarily be able
to preserve it well. Even if you accumulate books to leave to your
descendants, your descendants may not necessarily be able to read them well.
Nothing compares to accumulating
hidden virtues in the unseen realm"—
making this a plan for the long prosperity of descendants.

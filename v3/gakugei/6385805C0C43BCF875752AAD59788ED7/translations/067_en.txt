Seeing off Wei Wan as he goes to the capital
                Li Qi

This morning I heard a traveler singing a farewell song. Last night, light frost first crossed the river. The cries of wild geese are unbearable to hear amid sorrow. The clouded mountains - how much more so when passing through as a traveler. The dawn light at the border fortress hastens the approach of cold, and the sound of fulling blocks in the imperial garden grows frequent toward evening. Do not let Chang'an, though it be a place of pleasure, cause you to waste years in vain stumbling.【Seal: "Shoken"】

Commentary: This morning I heard that it is the season when one becomes a traveler, singing farewell songs and heading to the capital. Last night light frost fell for the first time across the river, making it cold. Along the journey, the sad cries of geese cannot be borne when heard amid the sorrows of travel. In the lonely mountains where clouds arise, how much more so when passing through as a guest. Upon arriving at the border fortress, the colors of the trees will be withered and the approach of cold weather will be near (dawn color - it would be better to read this as "tree color"). Around the imperial garden, the sounds of fulling blocks will be frequent in various places toward evening. Now, as a lesson: since Chang'an is a bustling place where one can freely enjoy pleasures, take care not to let your heart be distracted, forget your aspirations for advancement, and wastefully spend your years stumbling without purpose.

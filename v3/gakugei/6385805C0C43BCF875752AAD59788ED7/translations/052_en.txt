Upon witnessing this, I offered congratulations, and there was imperial grace, immediately granting wine banquets and music. Therefore, though presumptuous, I dare to record this event.

In ancient times, during the reigns of King Wen of Zhou and Emperor Wu of Han, as in the current imperial era, I had heard of sacred fungus (reishi) growing on the foundation stones of palace pillars. But how could five-colored clouds appear above the bronze pond?

Even if one were to laugh or make light of it, there would be no one to condemn such actions. Therefore, the Emperor was deeply moved, and just as during Japan's auspicious occasions when Noh performances and confections are granted to the townspeople of Edo, He bestows the benevolence of Emperor Yao upon the merchants in the streets of Kyoto. The sake distributed freely from wine barrels is ladled out with measures as large as the Big Dipper constellation.

Thus the Emperor appeared before the tower to observe, playing the seven-stringed qin of Emperor Shun's music, and like the gentle south wind that nurtures all things, He wishes to govern the people of the realm in peace and comfort, bringing joy to all the court officials.

Because this accorded with Heaven's will, sacred fungus and five-colored clouds manifested as auspicious omens, and the people's hearts felt the same, rejoicing in the Emperor's sacred virtue. Serving in such an auspicious era, we wish to serve our sage ruler for ten thousand years and a thousand autumns, forever.

A response poem presented in harmony with "Spring View During the Lingering Spring Rain on the Journey from Penglai Palace to Xingqing Palace"

The Wei River naturally winds around the Qin fortress in curves. Mount Huang has long encircled the Han palace obliquely. The imperial carriage emerges far beyond the willows of a thousand gates. The palace walkways wind round to view the flowers of the upper gardens. In the clouds, the imperial city has twin phoenix towers. In the spring rain, trees and homes of ten thousand people. This is to ride the yang energy and carry out seasonal governance, not for the emperor to merely enjoy the beauty of things.

In Harmony with Jia Zhi, Palace Attendant's Poem on Early Morning Court Attendance at Daming Palace
by Wang Wei

The cock-official in crimson cap announces the dawn hours. The Imperial Wardrobe just now presents robes of jade-green cloud brocade. When the gates of the nine heavens open the palace halls, officials from myriad nations bow to the imperial crown. The sun's rays barely touch the immortal's palm and gleam, while incense smoke seeks to float along the dragon robes. When morning court ends, one must draft edicts on five-colored paper. The sound of jade pendants returns to the Phoenix Pool's edge.

[Commentary]
In this period, there was no such thing as "matching rhymes" (wa-in) - taking up the meaning of another's poem and composing in response was called "harmonizing" (wa-su). Matching rhymes was something begun in the Late Tang by Bai Letian (Bai Juyi), Yuan Zhen, Pi Rixiu, Lu Guimeng and others. Wang Wei at this time held the position of Assistant to the Crown Prince. The crimson cap (jiang ze) is a cock's-comb-like headpiece. The cock-official (ji ren) is an official who announces the time - when he reports the dawn sixth hour, the Imperial Wardrobe presents robes embroidered with clouds in jade-green thread. The colors of court dress differ by season; this is spring attire. "Nine heavens" means the nine-fold palace. When the main gate (changhe) opens the various palace halls, officials from all nations don court dress and bow to the emperor's crown. The morning sun's light barely touches the immortal's palm atop the bronze pillar, gleaming - this is called "moving." There, incense burned at the emperor's side sends smoke that appears to float along his dragon-robed garments. This line also responds to the "sun's color" above. When morning court ends and all officials withdraw, you cannot do so - you must draft edicts on five-colored paper, so the sound of jade pendants returns to Phoenix Pool (another name for the Secretariat). The "five colors" above echoes with the character "phoenix." The Records of Yecheng states that Shi Hu of Later Zhao used five-colored paper for edicts, having them held in wooden phoenixes' mouths. In the title, Jia Zhi is a person's name, and Palace Attendant (she ren) is an official title.

Long ago, it is said that phoenixes danced and played atop Phoenix Terrace, but the phoenixes have departed and the terrace has crumbled. What remains unchanged to this day is only watching the river water flow naturally. During the prosperous time of Wu in the Three Kingdoms period, they built palaces that were as elegant and beautiful as flowers and grass, but these too perished and became buried in dim pathways. Subsequently, the people in court dress and caps who established the capital during the Jin Dynasty have also left no trace, becoming ancient hills and mountains. What remains unchanged from ancient times is that the Three Mountains towering in the southwest appear to half-fall from the sky, visible beyond the blue heavens. Water emerges from between Jurong and Lishui mountains, converges, reaches Jinling where it divides into two streams—one entering the city, one circling outside the city walls. This is water flowing from the two mountains. Between them, White Egret Sandbar can be seen. The author Li Bai, due to Gao Lishi's slander, was in Jinling. Therefore, he compared floating clouds to slanderers and the sun to the ruler. Climbing to a high place and nostalgically thinking of the capital, he expressed the feelings of an exile: "All because floating clouds create obstruction and cover the bright sun, making it dark, Chang'an cannot be seen, causing people's hearts to grieve."

"Early Morning Court Audience at Daming Palace, Presented to Colleagues of Both Ministries" by Jia Zhi

With silver candles attending the court at dawn, the purple paths stretch long. The spring colors of the Forbidden City appear pale blue at daybreak. A thousand drooping willows hang at the blue lattice gates, while hundreds of singing orioles circle the Jianzhang Palace. The sound of swords and jade ornaments follows the footsteps on jade pavements. Bodies in court dress attract the fragrance from the imperial incense burners. Together bathing in imperial favor above Phoenix Pool, morning after morning dyeing brushes to serve the sovereign. [Seal: "Tenshin"]

According to the Tang History, there was Daming Palace in the Eastern Inner Palace. The "two ministries" refer to the Secretariat and the Imperial Chancellery. When going to court from one's residence, since it is still before dawn, one departs with silver candles (using the character for silver to represent white). Purple paths are the roads leading to the imperial palace. The spring colors of the Forbidden City appear blue-white at dawn. Weeping willows with countless branches droop at the blue lattice gates of government offices. "Hundred warbles" means countless bird songs, and the character "flowing" depicts birds flying here and there. "Jianzhang" borrows the name of a Han palace. Orioles circle the palace singing. Court officials entering the palace wear swords and make sounds with their jade ornaments, walking quietly across the beautiful jade-like stone pavement.

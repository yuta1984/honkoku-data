Gazing at Jimen (Thistle Gate)　by Zu Yong

Having once left Yantai, the traveler's heart is startled. Pipes and drums resound noisily in the Han general's camp. Cold light stretches ten thousand li, arising from accumulated snow. The dawn colors of the three frontiers stir the tall military banners. Beacon fires on the sandy battlefield encroach upon the barbarian moon. Clouds and mountains by the sea surround Jicheng. Though young, I am not like the clerk who cast aside his brush, yet discussing merit, I still wish to request a long tassel.

[Seals: "Zenjing's Seal" "Shoken"]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This has the same meaning as Binwang's "Lodging at Warm City" in regulated verse, composed while gazing at the camp from a position at Jimen. Yantai refers to Jimen, and having left the capital and come to this place once, the traveler's heart becomes clear and one is surprised by the surge of courage to achieve military merit. It is said that the character for "sheng" (pipe) should be read as "jia" (reed pipe).

Blowing reed pipes and beating drums noisily, the Han general's camp is visible. What is impressive is that the cold light intensifies for ten thousand li, appearing on the accumulated snow. Additionally, the dawn scene of the northern, western, and southern frontier regions moves the tall flags standing in rows. Calling the three frontiers "east, west, north" is an error. Beacon fires rise on the sandy battlefield, encroaching on the moon that illuminates the barbarian lands, and cold mountains by the sea are seen surrounding Jicheng. Now, seeing this military situation, though I am not like Ban Chao, the official who cast aside his brush in his youth, I discuss achieving merit and, like Zhong Jun, wish to request a long cord to bind and capture the barbarian captives.

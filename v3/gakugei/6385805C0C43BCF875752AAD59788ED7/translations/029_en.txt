The author of this poem (Zhang Yue) was transferred from Yuezhou in the south to become the military governor of Youzhou in the north. Last year, when he served as an official in Jingnan, being a warm region, plum blossoms bloomed profusely even in winter, appearing like snow. This year, having become the general of Jingbei at Youzhou and welcoming spring, it is so bitterly cold that snow has frozen solid on tree branches, looking like blooming plum blossoms. This is known not only to himself but to all his subordinates - that human affairs are never fixed. Such changes from south to north are truly unpredictable.

However, it is good to rejoice. The passage of years means that when winter departs, spring comes. Pacifying the frontier with guards' songs echoing daily everywhere brings joy mixed with sorrow. Today being New Year's Day, various officials attend court, and by the lord's feast, beacon fires are lit from night until dawn breaks, illuminating the celebration. Though serving in distant lands, facing westward toward the sun of Chang'an, he wishes to offer a cup of celebratory wine praying for longevity as enduring as Mount Nanshan. This expresses sincere loyalty to the ruler even while in distant lands. When speaking of "sun," there are historical precedents for referring to the emperor. [Note: Even though one interpretation refers to the emperor, there are two instances of the character for "sun"]

Temple on Dongting Lake Mountain

The empty mountain is quiet and solitary, giving rise to religious sentiment. The vacant valley stretches far with sounds of wild birds. The meditation chamber has always been a pleasure beyond the clouds. How could the incense platform be worldly emotion? Between clouds, the eastern peaks emerge in countless layers. Through the trees, a part of the southern lake appears clearly. If recluses like Chaofu and Xuyu shared this sentiment, they would not exchange vines and creepers for official caps and cords.

The author Zhang Yue was demoted to Yuezhou. Climbing to a mountain temple at Dongting Lake, he found the empty mountain quiet and still, naturally giving rise to Buddhist devotion. The vacant valley stretches far with no human sounds, only wild bird calls. The room for contemplating Zen has always been a pleasure in the realm of clouds. What worldly troubles could there be on a platform made of fragrant wood? As clouds arise, eastern peaks appear layered countless times, and looking through the dense trees, the southern Dongting Lake can be seen clearly in part. If recluses like Chaofu and Xuyu came here now to share this peaceful state of mind...

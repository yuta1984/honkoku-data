Passing by the Lanruo Temple of Zen Master Chenru and Lay Practitioner Xiao at Mount Song

Wuzhuo (Asanga) and Tianqin (Vasubandhu) are like brothers. At the Lanruo temple of Mount Song, one peak stretches clear under the sunny sky. Meals are taken following the sound of the resonating bell, and birds from their nests come down. Walking through the empty forest, one hears the sound of treading on fallen leaves. The gushing water surely moistens the incense table, and the rain of flowers from heaven should become level with the stone bed. Where are the tall pines of the deep cavern? Solemnly present is an ancient master (Buddha) from India.

[Seals: "Pine" "Pavilion"]

"Koji" (lay practitioner) is a term seen in the Vimalakirti Sutra, and "lanruo" is a Sanskrit term meaning "aranya," which the Tang called "wuzheng," referring to a temple. The Zen master and lay practitioner lived together in harmony at Mount Song. The cohabitation of these two gentlemen was like that of the great master Asanga of India and his younger brother, the bodhisattva Vasubandhu.

At their residence, the Lanruo temple of Mount Song, one peak appears clear in the sunlight. During the noon meal, following the sound of the bell, birds accustomed to hearing it come down from their nests to peck. Walking through the temple grounds, one hears the sound of treading on fallen leaves in the empty forest, expressing the tranquility. It is said that when the venerable Rahula gently placed his right hand into the earth, water would gush forth from the golden wheel foundation. When facing the Buddha, the water gushing in this temple's garden would surely moisten the table bearing the incense burner. When sutras are being expounded, mandala flowers would rain down from heaven, becoming level with the stone beds of this mountain.

Tall pines grow before the deep cavern, and when one wonders what is there, one finds a Buddha called "ancient master" in India, wearing kasaya robes and sitting solemnly. The two characters "deep" and "long" convey increasingly profound mystery. The Keiko Yoroku states that the great master Asanga of India and his younger brother, bodhisattva Vasubandhu, wrote five hundred volumes discussing Mahayana Buddhism. Also, the monk Zhihou of the Liang dynasty, finding no water at Baoji Temple, struck the ground with his staff to make a hole, causing a spring to well up several feet. The Chuandeng Lu also records that the venerable Rahula obtained sweet dew water. This is the source of the gushing water.

A poem composed in response to "Following the Imperial Composition from Penglai to Xingqing Pavilion, Spring Lingering on the Journey, Spring View in the Rain"

Li Tao

At the separate palace, spring returns and pure qi is stirred. From the three palaces, the winding road leads to the Phoenix Terrace. Clouds fly away and light shadows scatter from the northern palace; rain ceases and the accumulated emerald green of the southern mountains approaches. The imperial willows distantly follow the celestial retinue in budding, while flowers in the upper forest bloom without waiting for the evening breeze. It is already known that the sacred benevolence is deep and limitless; even more joyful is that the beauty of young spring enters into the imperial talent. [Seals: "Shengjing" "Songxuan"]

This topic appeared before. "Separate palace" refers to Xingqing Palace. At this detached palace, as spring's atmosphere returns and good qi is stirred, from this Xingqing Palace viewing the spring scenery toward Penglai Palace, the road winds from the three palaces up to a magnificent terrace where one views the spring scenery in the rain. "Phoenix" refers to something magnificent. The clouds have flown away and the light overcast above the northern palace has also dispersed. The rain has stopped and the deep green of Mount Zhongnan directly ahead approaches close to one's eyes. The imperial willows distantly follow the celestial retinue in putting forth their green, and the flowers of the upper forest, being moistened by the emperor's benevolent grace, bloom even without waiting for the evening breeze. Knowing that the sacred benevolence from above is deep and limitless, how especially joyful it is that even the willow flowers beautifully welcome the young spring, and that this enters into the emperor's excellent talent in poetry.

Pouring Wine for Pei Di

I pour wine and offer it to you, my friend - please ease your heart. Human emotions with their reversals are like turbulent waves. Even white-haired old friends who know each other well still reach for their swords. The established figures at vermillion gates laugh at those adjusting their caps for office. The grass is completely moistened, having been through fine rain. Flower branches, wanting to sway in the spring wind, feel cold. What is there worth asking about worldly affairs that drift like floating clouds? Nothing is better than lying high and simply adding to one's meal. [Seal: "Tenshin"]

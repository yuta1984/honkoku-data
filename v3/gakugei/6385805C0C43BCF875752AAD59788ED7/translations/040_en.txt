"Climbing Phoenix Terrace in Jinling"

On Phoenix Terrace, phoenixes once played. The phoenixes have departed, the terrace stands empty, yet the Yangtze River flows naturally onward. The flowers and grasses of Wu Palace are buried in shadowy paths. The court dress and caps of the Jin Dynasty have become ancient mounds. The Three Mountains half-disappear beyond the blue sky, while two streams divide the White Egret Sandbar in their midst. All this is because floating clouds can obscure the sun, and not being able to see Chang'an causes people to grieve.

　　Entering the Temple Hall Again to Record Events - Composed by Imperial Command

Returning from the south, I am reborn again in heaven. The inner palace this year differs from years past. I see the universe opened and a new throne established, observing the sun and moon inscribed and hung even higher. Walking, I follow the fragrant imperial carriage on the path ascending to immortality. Sitting, I draw near to the mat where dharma is taught amid incense smoke. I rejoice in myself, having received deep imperial favor to serve as an attendant, remaining long before the sage ruler through both reigns.

Shen Quanqi was also implicated in Wu Zetian's affairs and received rebuke from Emperor Zhongzong, being exiled to Huanzhou. When Emperor Ruizong ascended the throne, he was recalled and became a scholar at the Xiuwen Academy - this poem was likely composed at that time. Having received imperial grace and come from Huanzhou in the south to the court, it was as if he had floated up to heaven and been reborn, using the Buddhist term "shengtian" (rebirth in heaven). The appearance of the inner palace when I look up this year differs from previous years under the former emperor - this is because clearly the universe was opened and Emperor Ruizong newly ascended the throne. Looking at the two imperial calligraphy plaques - one from the previous Emperor Zhongzong and one from the current emperor - they hang in an even higher place like the sun and moon. When accompanying the imperial procession, one advances along the road where the emperor rides in his fragrant imperial carriage for the imperial visit. "The path ascending to immortality" means the path of the imperial visit.

Ancient Style　by Shen Quanqi

The young wife of the Lu family lives in the Yujin Hall. Sea swallows nest in pairs on the tortoiseshell-decorated beams. In the ninth month, the cold fulling blocks urge the falling of leaves; ten years of military service bring memories of Liaoyang. North of White Wolf River, letters are cut off; south of Vermilion Phoenix City, autumn nights are long. For whom does she harbor sorrow, alone and unseen? She further causes the bright moon to illuminate the pale yellow curtains. [Seals: "Geijing" "Shoken"]

Long ago, in the Lu family there was a young woman named Mo Chou who lived harmoniously with her husband in a beautiful room called Yujin Hall. Just as paired swallows from the seaside nested together on beams decorated with tortoiseshell, such a happy couple existed. But in complete contrast to that, I sleep alone in the depths of my bedroom. Since it is the ninth month, people everywhere are preparing padded winter clothes, and the sound of fulling blocks urges the scene of falling leaves. Though where my husband is also faces the coming cold, there is no one to prepare winter clothes for him. Not just one or two years, but for ten years he has followed military campaigns, serving as a guard stationed in Liaodong, so I miss him terribly and cannot sleep at night. The place where my husband is located has the frightening name of north of White Wolf River. Even letters have ceased to arrive. The capital where I reside has the elegant name of south of Vermilion Phoenix City, and I cannot get through the autumn nights, which feel extremely long. In such sad times, filled with overflowing sorrow in my breast, among the many flute melodies, I especially play the tune called "Alone and Unseen," which makes me miss him even more. Furthermore, when the bright moon illuminates the pale yellow curtains hanging in my bedroom, my longing intensifies. I once enjoyed looking at this bright moon together with my husband, but now when light shines into my lonely curtained chamber, I am reminded even more of my husband and recall the happy times we shared in the past, and tears flow—how heartbreaking it is.

Seeing Off Junior Prefect Li Who Was Demoted to Xiaxia and Junior Prefect Wang Who Was Demoted to Changsha　　Gao Shi

How sorrowful is this parting of yours, my friends! I stop my horse and raise my cup to inquire about your exiled dwellings. In the Wu Gorge, the crying apes will bring tears to your eyes, and at Hengyang, the returning geese will remind you of letters from home. The autumn sky above the Blue Maple River is distant, and the ancient trees by Baidi City are sparse. In this enlightened age, imperial grace is abundant, so though you must part for a while, do not hesitate.

Xiaxia is in western Shu, and Changsha is in the south. This single poem sends off two people. "How sorrowful is the heart of you gentlemen at this parting! I stop the horses of your departure and, with cup in hand, ask about your places of exile. In the Wu Gorge where Mr. Li goes, there are many crying apes, and hearing their pitiful voices, you will shed many tears in sorrow. In the area of Hengyang south of Changsha where Mr. Wang goes, seeing the returning geese, you will think of how many letters might come, and how lonely you must feel. Looking out over the Blue Maple River at Changsha, the autumn sky appears hazy and distant, and around Baidi City in Shu, the ancient trees have shed their leaves and become sparse - how melancholy it must be. There you will miss the capital even more, but since this is an enlightened reign and the present time brings abundant grace like rain and dew, though you must separate for a while, you will surely be recalled before long. Do not hesitate to go."

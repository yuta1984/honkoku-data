A poem given to Wei Shiyu and various officials when Zhang Yuanwai of the Lower Left Section met them on Lichun (Beginning of Spring) day, while traveling as an envoy from Luoyang to the capital, first stopping at Chang'an　　by Sun Ti

Suddenly I saw several geese returning through the clouds, and further encountered a single flower blooming on the mountain. The pure qi by the riverside welcomes the fragrant grass, while the gentle breeze under the forest awaits the falling plum blossoms. High poetry entered the autumn surveillance bureau, and harmonizing verses came from the spring ministry office. Together we say: "The Eastern Pavilion is a place that invites worthy men, and naturally there is talent to compose rhyme-prose on western campaigns."

Regarding this title: "Yuanwai" refers to a supernumerary official position - when someone is appointed to a role outside the regular quota, they are called a person "outside the quota." The twenty-two characters following "from Luo" constitute Zhang Yuanwai's title. It appears that a minister was residing in Chang'an county. When Zhang Yuanwai was serving as an imperial messenger traveling from Luoyang to the capital, he first went to Chang'an county to have an audience with the minister, and on meeting the Beginning of Spring day, he presented this poem to Wei Shiyu and various officials residing in Chang'an county. "Various officials" refers to people from the Ministry of Rites, and since Sun Ti was included among these "various officials," he composed this responding poem.

In Japan, geese do not return north at the time of Beginning of Spring, but it is remarkable that Chang'an county in Tang China experiences warm weather early. Since he encountered Beginning of Spring during his journey, he suddenly saw several geese returning through the clouds. As a particular sign of spring's return, he encountered a single flower blooming on the mountain. Moreover, the pure qi around the riverside seems welcomed by the young grass, and the gentle breeze under the forest appears to await and scatter the plum blossoms. These first four couplets all describe the spring scenery observed along the road.

"Autumn surveillance" refers to the surveillance officials, indicating Wei Shiyu, while "spring ministers" refers to court attendants involved in ceremonies, indicating the various officials. These two lines express how good poetry entered the offices and greeting poems came in response. Since Zhang Yuanwai's excellent poetry reached both the surveillance office and the ministry office, both the surveillance officials and the ministry officials sent greeting poems in return. Not just individuals, but everyone together said: "Though there are places in government offices where worthy men are invited like Gongsun Hong of Han dynasty, you naturally possess the talent to compose rhyme-prose on western campaigns like Pan Yue of Jin dynasty, so you will surely advance to excellent positions quickly."

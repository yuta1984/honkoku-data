Seeing Off Li Hui

I know that your official position belongs to the Grand Minister of Agriculture. By imperial edict, there is a royal visit to Li Mountain, and official duties are flourishing. Year after year, gold and silver are disbursed to supply the imperial treasury. During the day, one watches the immortal springs flow into the detached palace. On a thousand crags, dawn snow appears above the banner gates, and in the tenth month, cold flowers bloom along the imperial carriage road. Unable to see the reputation and cultural refinements, I myself feel sorrowful about remaining and departing from the eastern provinces.

Li becomes Assistant Minister of Agriculture (deputy of the treasury). Now, knowing that your official position is subordinate to the Grand Minister of Agriculture (Minister of Treasury). This time there is an imperial edict for a royal visit to Li Mountain. Therefore, the official duties of allocating corvée labor to the people are impartial, clean, and vigorous. Corresponding to the first verse, year after year gold and silver are disbursed to supply the imperial treasury, and during the day one daily watches the immortal springs (hot springs) flow through bamboo pipes into the detached palace called Huaqing Palace. The light of dawn snow on countless crags will shine upon the temporary gates where banners are erected in rows. Though it is the tenth month, the remaining cold flowers blooming along the carriage road will be seen while accompanying the imperial procession. Here in the distant province of Xinxiang County, one cannot see the capital's fame (the sound of bells on banners and palanquins) or the cultural refinements (patterns) of clothing. I myself feel sorrowful about remaining behind and being in the eastern provinces.

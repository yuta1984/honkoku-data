A poem written in response to Secretary Jia Zhi's early morning attendance at Daming Palace　Part 1　　Cen Can

Roosters crow on the purple paths, and the dawn light is cold. Orioles warble in the imperial capital, and the spring colors are at their peak. The dawn bell of the golden palace opens ten thousand gates, and immortal guards on jade steps surround thousands of officials. Flowers welcome sword-bearers and pendants as stars begin to fall; willows brush against banners while dew has not yet dried. Only the guest at Fenghuang Pool remains, for whom harmonizing with the song "Yang Chun" is difficult for all.

The "purple" (紫) in "purple paths" harmonizes with "子" (zi), and "imperial" (皇) in "imperial capital" harmonizes with "yellow" (黄). The first and second lines form a couplet. Roosters crow on the main roads at the castle gates, and even the dawn light is cold. Orioles warble in the capital, and the spring colors have reached their full depth. "Lan" (闌) means the depth of spring. When night breaks and the dawn bell of the golden palace rings, ten thousand gates are pushed open. Immortal guards are lined up in front of the beautiful steps, surrounding the thousand officials attending court. The flowers blooming beautifully seem to welcome the officials who wear swords and ring jade pendants. The starlight has also faded away. Willow branches brush against the lined-up banners, wet with morning dew that has not yet dried. As a greeting to Jia Zhi, only you have become a guest at Fenghuang Pool, composing a high-toned piece called "Yang Chun," which is difficult for everyone to harmonize with.

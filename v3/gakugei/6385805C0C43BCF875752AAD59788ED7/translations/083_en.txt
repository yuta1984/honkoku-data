Dedicated to Lu Wu's Former Residence - Li Qi

Though objects remain, the person has perished; there is no prospect of meeting again. Tying my horse in the quiet courtyard, I cannot bear the sorrow. Green bamboo before the window grows in the empty ground; the blue mountains beyond the gate look the same as in former times. Gazing sadly at the blue sky, falling leaves make noise; in the towering ancient willows, cold owls roost. Thinking of you, my tears fall like eastward-flowing water. Year after year flowers bloom - but for whom do they know to open?

[Seals: "譱靖" "松軒"]

The character "贈" (dedicate) should probably be the character "題" (inscribe), which is not audible. After Lu Wu's death, I came to his former residence and remembered our past encounters, inscribing on the wall. The things I saw in the past remain as they were, but the master has died and there is no prospect of meeting again. I tie my horse in the quiet garden, unable to bear the grief. Green bamboo grows thick in the empty ground before the window of the room where Lu Wu studied, and the blue mountains visible outside the gate remain unchanged from former times. Looking out sadly, fallen leaves rustle from the blue sky, and owls perch coldly in the towering withered willows. Thinking fondly of you, tears fall from nowhere like eastward-flowing water that never returns to its source. Yet every year flowers bloom heartlessly. With Lu Wu no longer here, for whom do they bloom? This increasingly reminds me of the times when Lu Wu and I met with such ease. Now, the fifth and sixth lines use the "yang" rhyme with the two characters "悵望," and the "yuan" rhyme with the two characters "巑岏," employing overlapping rhymes to create couplets - one should observe this technique. Also, in this poem, the character "青" appears twice in "青山" (blue mountains) and "青天" (blue sky) - one of these is probably a copying error.

This is what it means. Ascending and sitting in the imperial inner hall, I draw near to the imperial mat where the dharma is expounded amid rising incense smoke. What I rejoice in is having received the emperor's deep grace and serving in the ranks of attendants, remaining long before the emperor through both the reigns of Zhongzong and Ruizong. "Sage ruler" here refers to the emperor.

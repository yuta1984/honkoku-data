"The Dragon Pool Chapter"

At Dragon Pool, a dragon leaped and has already flown away. The dragon's virtue preceded Heaven, and did not deviate from Heaven. The pool opens the Milky Way and divides the ecliptic. The dragon faces the Gate of Heaven and enters the Purple Forbidden Enclosure. The mansions and towers have much splendor, and the ruler's ducks and geese possess radiance. Report to all the hundred rivers under Heaven: come pay court to this place, and do not return east.

[Seals: "Eijō" "Shōken"]

When Emperor Xuanzong was still a prince, there was a place called Dragon Pool at his residence. From there a dragon leaped up, and just as Heaven had foretold that the dragon's virtue would ascend to Heaven, Xuanzong indeed became emperor without deviating from this prophecy. Thus, the two characters "Dragon Pool" are placed at the beginning of the verses. That pool was like an opening of the Milky Way, and in that vicinity the "Yellow Road" - the imperial procession route - was divided.

The dragon that lived in that pool faced the Gate of Heaven and entered the Purple Forbidden Enclosure. Even the original mansion and towers became magnificently splendid, and even the ducks and geese floating on the pool shone brilliantly. Therefore, it proclaims to all the great and small rivers under Heaven: come pay court to this place, and there is no need to return to the Eastern Sea. This means that all the great and minor lords under Heaven should come pay court to this place, and there is no need for them to go to the eastern seas.

Yao Chong, Shen Quanqi and others were commanded to compose ten chapters of "Dragon Pool Musical Verses." This is one of those chapters.

The "Yellow Road" refers to the path of the sun's movement, which is used here as a metaphor for the emperor's procession route.

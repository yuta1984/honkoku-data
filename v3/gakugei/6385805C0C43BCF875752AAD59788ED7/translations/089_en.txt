Sending Tribute to Imperial Attendant Du (Playfully Presented) by Zhang Wei

The road to Bronze Pillar and Scarlet Cliff is treacherous. General Fubo once crossed the sea and ascended the altar. The Yue people offered coral trees of their own accord, so why must Han envoys toil wearing the xiezhi cap? Weary horses worry about nightfall in the mountains, while a lone boat on the river fears the spring cold. These goods have always been called difficult to obtain, but what is most feared is that the sovereign cannot bear to watch.

Commentary:
The Son of Heaven commanded Imperial Attendant Du to be sent to Southern Yue to seek coral trees. If the Son of Heaven's governance were good, even the Hu and Yue would naturally submit and献上 not only coral trees but any rare treasures to the capital. Here, the poet subtly satirizes throughout the entire poem that the Son of Heaven's governance is not good, hence calling it "playfully presented."

When Ma Yuan of the Later Han went to subjugate the barbarians, he erected bronze pillars as the Han border, and Han Yue of the Former Han went to Zhuya Commandery. The places where pearls emerge are all remote locations with difficult roads. Ma Yuan was the General Who Calms the Waves, Han Yue became the General Who Crosses the Sea, and the Son of Heaven had them ascend the altar and bestowed general's seals before their departure. These are considered difficult undertakings.

In the past, the Yue people submitted to the capital and naturally offered coral trees, so why now must you become a Han envoy and toil wearing the fearsome xiezhi cap to serve as an inspector? These two lines correspond to the difficulty of roads in the first line.

Now, the various treasures being sent to the capital are loaded on horses in haste, so the horses become weary and worry about nightfall in the mountains. Also, when transported by water in a lone boat, one fears the harsh spring winds and cold on the river. Since ancient times, such treasures have been said to be difficult to obtain. What is most worrying is that the sovereign cannot bear to see the suffering of making officials toil and using common people for corvée labor to send these goods to the capital.

This is because Tang honored Laozi as their foremost ancestor and erected temples to him in various provinces. This contradicts Laozi's teaching that "do not seek treasures that are hard to obtain," going against ancestral teachings and failing to accord with Laozi's divine will - thus this satirical remonstrance.

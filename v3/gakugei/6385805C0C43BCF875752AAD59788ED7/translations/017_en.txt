Attending a Banquet at Princess Anle's New Residence: A Court Response
                        Su Ting

Swift cavalry horses traverse the castle moats, the imperial daughter's towers open toward evening.
Dew sprinkles the banners emerging beyond the clouds, wind circles the rocky gorges moving through rain.
Against the eaves, celestial river water half-falls, around the path, moon-tree branches hang completely low.
On this day of pipes and drums for the imperial excursion and banquet attendance, we rejoice at the harmonious singing of paired phoenixes coming in ceremony.

"Swift and steady" refers to horses advancing quickly with coordinated steps. The "feathered cavalry" are the advance guards bearing bows and arrows. As Emperor Zhongzong makes his imperial visit, the horses quicken their pace, and the advance guard passes by the castle's moat. The imperial daughter (Princess Anle) also opens her towers toward evening, waiting in preparation. Since the second line contains the characters "toward evening," it appears that rain is referred to as "dew." Light rain falls and sprinkles, so the banners standing in rows become moist and appear fluttering beyond the clouds. Wind circles around the rocky gorge paths, gradually moving forward through the falling rain. The characters "fall" and "low" in the fifth and sixth lines seem to carry the atmosphere of rain. The waterfall visible against the eaves appears like celestial river water half-falling, unified as one, naturally containing allusions to the Weaving Girl through the celestial river. Circling the garden paths, with rain falling heavily and drooping, it's like seeing the branches of cassia trees in the moon - this also contains allusions to immortal maidens dwelling in the moon. Through "celestial river water" and "moon-tree branches," this describes scenery beyond the ordinary realm of mountains and waters. With the music of pipes and drums, the Son of Heaven's imperial excursion is pleasantly lively, and on this day when court officials attend the imperial banquet, the princess and her husband's harmonious relationship and proper deportment is like the beautiful sight of male and female phoenixes beginning to sing harmoniously, arriving with wings aligned - we offer our congratulations. The two characters "pipes" and "phoenix" subtly contain allusions to the immortal maiden Nongyu of Qin.

In foreign countries, the practice of a vassal serving as regent began with Duke of Zhou Dan. In our country, when Emperor Seiwa was young, his maternal grandfather Duke Chūjin served as regent in place of the emperor, also following the example of Duke of Zhou. Once, Duke of Zhou admonished his son Bai Qin, saying: "I am the son of King Wen, younger brother of King Wu, and uncle of King Cheng. Nevertheless, when I wash my hair once, I grasp my hair three times, and when I eat once, I spit out food three times and stand up to receive scholars, fearing that I might lose the wise men of the realm."

Shu Yu composes the Poem of the Paulownia Leaf. One day, King Cheng of Zhou was playing with his younger brother Shu Yu in the shade of a paulownia tree in the front courtyard. King Cheng asked Shu Yu, "Can you compose poetry well?" Shu Yu replied, "I understand its meaning somewhat." King Cheng said, "I shall take this paulownia leaf and make it into a ceremonial tablet. If you can compose this poem well, I shall make you a feudal lord." Shu Yu immediately composed the poem of the paulownia leaf. King Cheng was pleased and said, "Your literary talent is quite excellent. However, you are young and cannot be appointed to the position of a feudal lord. Wait several years and then I shall make you a feudal lord." At that time, a minister named Shi Yi was nearby and memorialized, saying, "Why does Your Majesty change your words?" King Cheng said, "I was only joking." Shi Yi said, "The Son of Heaven does not speak in jest. Once you utter words, the court historians will record them in the historical records. I hope that our king will not go back on his word regarding the enfeoffment of Shu Yu." King Cheng then enfeoffed Shu Yu as the Marquis of Tang.

　Poem of the Paulownia Leaf　Shu Yu
　　The paulownia leaves fall in the courtyard
　　My king carves and makes them into tablets
　　Like thinking of the excellence of connected branches
　　They flourish and extend with the spring wind　　　　　Shu Yu (This is the founding ancestor of the state of Jin, which later divided into the three states of Han, Zhao, and Wei)

In a place called Shitsu in the state of Qi, there was a person whose family name was Jian, personal name was Shu, and courtesy name was Boshi. Though he was broadly versed in ancient and contemporary matters and wise in political affairs, he lived in retirement and did not serve in government. Duke Mu of Qin, on the recommendation of Baili Xi, sent Prince Zhi to Qi as an envoy. When Zhi sought out and reached that place, he saw a thatched hut in a bamboo grove with a clear spring to the left and white stones to the right. Zhi dismounted from his horse and knocked on the brushwood gate. A young servant came out from within and said, "The master went out to view flowers this morning. He should return soon."

After a while, a man with long ears and a thin appearance, wearing a cloth robe and riding a donkey, holding a branch of plum blossoms in his hand, quietly reciting poetry about winter plums, returned with a servant carrying a food container. Zhi went out to meet him, and Jian Shu dismounted from the donkey and led him into the grass hut. When Zhi conveyed Duke Qin's command, Jian Shu firmly declined. Zhi said, "This is what Baili Xi recommends. Why would you not serve such a ruler and instead rot away with the grass and trees?" He then accompanied Jian Shu to Qin. Duke Qin descended the steps to personally welcome him, granted him the rank of Senior Grand Master, and had him govern politics together with Baili Xi. From then on, the state of Qin greatly expanded its hegemony. Having achieved merit and fame, he resigned from office, returned to Shitsu village in Qi, and died at over eighty years of age.

Duke Xian of Jin attacked the Lirong and obtained Lady Li as his consort, who bore Xiqi. Lady Li wanted to install her own son to inherit the throne, so she slandered and killed Crown Prince Shensheng. Shensheng's younger brother Chong'er fled to a country called Di, while Chong'er's younger brother Yiwu fled to the state of Liang. Later, a minister named Li Ke killed Xiqi, destroyed Lady Li's faction, and welcomed Yiwu to ascend the throne, who became Duke Hui. Chong'er married a daughter of the Di state and after more than ten years had two children. His ministers Zhao Shuai, Gu Mao, and others deliberated to go to Qin and Chu, ally with these great states, and return to enter Jin. They first went to the state of Wei. Duke Wei closed his gates and would not admit them. Chong'er became angry and went with his followers to the state of Cao, but their provisions ran out and the officers and soldiers became weary and distressed. On the road, several farmers were eating their midday meal. Chong'er had Gu Yan request their food. The farmers said, "We are small folk of the village; how could we have any surplus?" They jokingly picked up a clod of earth and gave it to Gu Yan, saying, "We have no food, but we'll offer you this earth." Wei Chou became greatly enraged and tried to take their hoe to whip the farmers. Gu Yan stopped him and said, "Earth is the foundation of a state. This means you will receive a state from Heaven." Chong'er agreed and dismounted from his carriage to bow and receive it. At this time, Jie Zitui offered the flesh from his thigh to Chong'er. Finally they reached Qi. Duke Huan gave his niece Jiang as wife to Chong'er and treated him with great honor.

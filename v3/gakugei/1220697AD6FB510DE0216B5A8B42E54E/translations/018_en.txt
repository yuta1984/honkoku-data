Yang Youji: His surname was Yang, given name Youji. He was a low-ranking soldier under Shu'ao, a retainer of King Zhuang of Chu. His archery was godlike—he shot a hundred times and hit the target a hundred times. When competing for the position of vanguard, he stepped back a hundred paces and shot through a willow leaf, thereby earning the position of vanguard. During the reign of King Gong, Yang You was made Grand General of the Palace Guard.

When Youji appeared on the battlefield, none who faced him returned alive. Fearing his bow's power, none dared approach him. He was called the Divine Archer General. The Duke of Jin thought: "As long as Youji remains in Chu, we cannot win," so in the dark of night, he launched ten thousand crossbow bolts simultaneously and finally shot Youji to death.

Hearing the wild goose's cry beyond the clouds, shooting at night. Following the story of Yang Youji of Chu shooting wild geese above the clouds, this picture is drawn. According to one account, a retainer of King Mu of Zhou named Geng Ying could shoot birds by releasing arrows into empty space. Once, in the presence of the king, upon hearing the sound of wild geese passing from east to west, he immediately shot one down. This picture shows Yang Youji going out to hunt. If it were Geng Ying, he would be wearing court robes and a cap while releasing arrows. This picture has been traditionally depicted as Yang Youji since ancient times.

The picture should be drawn above this text.

　　　　The Golden Dragon Protecting King Wu
The tyrant King Zhou of Yin was wicked and immoral, causing suffering to all the people. King Wu lamented this and consulted with Duke Tai Gong Wang to destroy King Zhou for the sake of the realm. He raised an army of several tens of thousands of cavalry and advanced toward the imperial capital. When they fought against King Zhou's 800,000 cavalry at Muye, all of Yin's generals were defeated and could not advance. At this point, King Zhou's general named Fangxiang took up his spear horizontally, spurred his horse, and charged directly into King Wu's formation. Thrusting left and striking right as if moving through an empty field, he finally broke into King Wu's main camp and tried to stab King Wu with his long spear. Then a crimson light shone brilliantly, and an eight-clawed golden dragon appeared, blocking and covering King Wu's royal carriage. Fangxiang was startled and turned his horse back, but the two generals San Yisheng and Nangong Huo were already ready to strike him down. Fangxiang fought them for more than thirty rounds before finally being captured alive and brought before King Wu. King Wu, admiring Fangxiang's courage, pardoned his life. Afterward, Fangxiang said, "Now that King Zhou has already perished, what honor do I have to preserve my life?" and cut off his own head and died.

[12] Frozen Tofu　Cut one block into about eight pieces, arrange in a basket, pour boiling
　　　water over them, take outside and expose to extremely cold weather for one night. The next day, boil again in hot water
　　　to soften, and when they float up, remove them and apply a little
　　　pressure, then arrange in baskets again and expose to sunlight
　　　for many days. ○It's good to crack gardenia seeds into the boiling water to prevent insects
　　　from infesting later. ○It's best to expose them from midnight onwards;
　　　early evening is not good. ○Also called Kōya tofu.
　　　▲Prepared as above but exposed to cold for only one night, then used
　　　immediately the next day - this is called "quick-frozen."

[13] Quick-frozen Tofu　As described above.

[14] Ground Flowing Tofu　Grind well, mix with kudzu powder and grind well,
　　　then strain into miso soup while grinding.

[15] Pressed Tofu　Wrap in cloth, place on boards arranged diagonally, apply weights heavy enough not to crush it,
　　　squeeze out water well, simmer with equal parts fresh soy sauce, sake, and salt,
　　　then cut into rounds.

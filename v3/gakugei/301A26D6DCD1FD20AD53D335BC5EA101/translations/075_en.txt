"Composed in the Desert"

Urging my horse westward, wanting to reach the heavens
Having left home, I've seen the moon become full twice
Tonight I know not where I shall lodge
Across ten thousand li of level sand, no human habitation

【Modern Translation and Commentary】
Due to official business, I hurry considerably, urging my horse onward and upward, climbing ever higher as if ascending to heaven. Since leaving home and setting out on this journey, fifteen days have passed twice, making it two months. Tonight, where shall I stay?

The vast sandy plains stretch endlessly with no houses in sight, and there is no place where I might seek lodging. Most likely I shall sleep upon this sand. How lonely and anxious this makes me feel.

Song of Following the Army (Jūgunkō)　　　　By Wang Changling (Ōshōrei)

Long clouds over the blue sea darken the snowy mountains,
From the lonely fortress I gaze far toward Jade Gate Pass.
Through yellow sands and a hundred battles, my golden armor is pierced—
Until Loulan is destroyed, I will never return home.

Looking from this fortress, all is vast and desolate. Having come to this barbarian land north of the blue sea, clouds stretch long and make even the snowy mountains appear completely black and fearsome. Jade Gate Pass is at the northwestern edge, a distant place. Passing through there and coming to this remote frontier where soldiers enter this lonely fortress, even gazing toward Jade Gate Pass seems far away. The capital is ever more distant. Because there are frequent battles in the desert, there is no time to remove one's armor. In such circumstances, when will I return to my homeland? Most likely I will not return until Loulan is completely destroyed, but this seems endless.

Spring Affairs at the Mountain Dwelling　by Cen Can

At Liang Garden at sunset crows fly in disorder, as far as the eye can see, desolate with only two or three houses.
The garden trees do not know that all people have departed, when spring comes they still bloom with flowers of former times.

This was once a prosperous place, but now there is no coming and going of people, and at dusk crows fly in flocks. Looking as far as the eye can strain into the distance, it appears lonely and desolate, with only two or three farmers' houses visible. The trees that grow carelessly in this place are the garden trees of the ancient Liang Garden, but the people who loved that garden have already departed, and there is no one left to appreciate them. Yet when spring comes, flowers bloom on the old branches with no one to see them. For details, one should consult the commentary texts.

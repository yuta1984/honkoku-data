Fine wine of Lanling with turmeric fragrance, jade bowl filled with amber light
If only the host can intoxicate the guest, one knows not where is foreign land

Lanling is a place famous for good wine. Turmeric fragrance refers to fragrant wine. To be served such wine in a splendid jade bowl is truly gracious. When good wine is poured into a fine cup, it gives off an amber light. The host refers to the innkeeper where one is currently staying during travel. Because he serves wine, one enjoys oneself not knowing whether this is home or foreign land - this is the underlying sentiment. It contains the sadness of forgetting travel sorrows through wine.

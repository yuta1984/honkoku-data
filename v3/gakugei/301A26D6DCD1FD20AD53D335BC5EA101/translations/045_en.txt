Song of Going Beyond the Frontier (Shutsusaikō)
　By Wang Changling (Ōshōrei)

In the white grass prairie lands,
Looking toward the capital city,
The Yellow River waters flow
Without end through autumn skies.
In the vast wilderness, travelers
Are few; whose horse approaches
From the east?

In the barbarian lands, the grass does not grow green but remains white, hence it is called "white grass prairie." Though one longs for and gazes toward the capital of one's homeland, the capital cannot be seen - what a distant place one has come to! Wondering where the capital might be and looking out, still the capital cannot be seen. The only thing visible is the endless, vast flow of the Yellow River waters from west to east. Being beyond the frontier, this is a place where in the autumn sky there are boundless fields with no human presence. Who might that be coming on horseback from the east? What sort of person? In this place devoid of human presence, suddenly seeing a person was quite startling indeed.

Autumn Resentment in the Western Palace by Wang Changling

The lotus flowers cannot match a beauty's adornment; in the water pavilion the wind brings fragrance of pearls and jade
Yet resentfully holding feelings within, she covers the autumn fan; in vain hanging the bright moon, she waits for her lord

Even the lotus flowers cannot match the beauty's makeup. Because the lord's favor has waned, being a woman's matter, she does not speak in words but contains her emotions within. Like covering and putting away an autumn fan, his affection has grown cold. However, in her heart, like the bright moon hanging clear without clouds, she waits thinking that perhaps on such a moonlit night her lord might come to visit. Details can be found in commentaries and historical records.

Seeing Off Attendant Li as He Goes to Changzhou

Snow clears, clouds scatter, and the north wind is cold,
The waters of Chu and mountains of Wu make the road difficult.
Today in sending you off, we should drink to our heart's content,
Tomorrow when we think of each other, the road will stretch endlessly.

By Jia Zhi

It appears to be winter, with fallen snow now cleared and clouds dispersed. Being after the snow, the north wind blows cold and desolate. The road you are taking to Changzhou is not level ground - it is a very difficult path with treacherous terrain.

Today I urge you to drink sake, so drink fully and become thoroughly intoxicated. For tomorrow we part ways and who knows when we shall meet again. The road stretches endlessly to distant places, so our reunion is uncertain.

Hu Jiding comments that this poem resembles Wang Wei's poem sending off Yuan Er on his mission to Anxi. Surely thinking that "tomorrow when we think of each other, the road will stretch endlessly," he says "today we should drink to our heart's content." Thinking that "west of Yangguan Pass there will be no old friends," he urges "drink once more this cup of wine."

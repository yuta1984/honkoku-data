Seeing Off Yuwen Liu - by Chang Jian

Flowers reflect on drooping willows, the Han River is clear
A gentle breeze in the grove, one branch light
Right now in Jiangbei it's still like this
But it would break the heart - Jiangnan's parting feelings

Since it is spring, the flowers are in full bloom, the willows are lush and green, reflecting in the Han River and appearing pure. At this time, the wind blowing through the grove is not fierce, but gentle and rustling, so the flowers do not scatter - it is a beautiful scene. The Jiangnan region where you are going has an earlier spring, so by the time you arrive, spring will likely be over. When you see the lonely scenery of Jiangnan, you will feel the emotion of parting and be saddened as you think fondly of the landscape of Jiangbei.

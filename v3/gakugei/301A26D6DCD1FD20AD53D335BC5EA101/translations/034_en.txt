Hearing a Flute on a Spring Night in Luoyang

Whose jade flute is it, sending its voice through the darkness?
Scattered into the spring wind, it fills all of Luoyang
Tonight, hearing "Breaking Willows" in this melody,
What person would not be moved to homesickness?

Li Bai

Who is playing it? Though I don't know who it might be, the sound is unexpectedly scattered by the spring wind throughout the entire capital, and there is probably no place where this voice cannot be heard. What melody is being played? It is the melody of "Breaking Willows," associated with parting. Anyone who travels would feel sorrow. Since I too am traveling, it stirs up my melancholy. "In darkness" (an ni) means "unexpectedly" or "unawares." However, it also serves as an appropriate character for nighttime. Details can be found in historical records.

Presented to Hua Qing by Du Fu

The silk and wind instruments of Jincheng sound abundantly each day, half carried by the river wind, half entering the clouds.
This music should exist only in heaven above; how many times can mortals hope to hear it?

In the capital of Shu, the music of silk and bamboo instruments of this time is half carried by the river wind and half enters the clouds, resounding even to heaven. This music, in truth, cannot be heard among common people. Such exquisite music as this was meant for emperors like Emperor Xuanzong to hear, so in the mortal world it cannot ordinarily be heard regularly. Hua Qing, you are the one who gets to hear this.

Hua Qing appears to be a general in the imperial court's service, but it can also be interpreted as referring to a courtesan. This illustration depicts courtesans of that time incorporating this poem into song.

Song of Pure Peace (Qingping diao)　Three Poems　Li Bai

In the clouds I think of her robes
In the flowers I think of her face
Spring wind sweeps the balustrade, dew thick on blossoms
If not seen at the peak of Mount Qunyu
Then surely we would meet facing the Jade Terrace under moonlight

To make clouds into clothing refers to celestial maidens. This speaks of when Emperor Xuanzong had beautiful women painted. Whether looking at clouds or flowers, he spent his days wanting to paint such beauties. When the spring wind swept the balustrades and he saw the exquisite dew on the flowers in full bloom—the finest blossoms of heaven—he spent his days wanting to paint such beauties. Such beauties would rarely exist in the human world. Unless the Queen Mother of the West were watching from beside Mount Qunyu, one could only meet them where the celestial maidens of the Jade Terrace dwell. In any case, they cannot be seen elsewhere.

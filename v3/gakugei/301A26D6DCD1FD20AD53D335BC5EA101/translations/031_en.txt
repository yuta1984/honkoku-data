Early Departure from White Emperor City

At dawn I bid farewell to White Emperor amid colored clouds
A thousand li to Jiangling, returning in a single day
On both banks, monkey cries never cease
The light boat has already passed ten thousand layered mountains

Departing from White Emperor City in a dignified manner, though the distance is said to be a thousand li, because the boat is swift, I arrived in just one day. Descending while hearing monkeys on both shores, they cry endlessly, wailing along the entire journey without stopping anywhere, continuing everywhere and stirring up the traveler's melancholy. Looking back, I have already passed over ten thousand mountains - how swift indeed!

[Spring Thoughts] by Jia Zhi

The grass is verdantly green and the willow's color is yellow, peach blossoms bloom in profusion and plum flowers are fragrant.
Does the spring wind not blow to dispel sorrow? The spring day is particularly able to draw out and prolong resentment.

This poem describes the height of spring's beauty. The grass is green in color, and the willows are yellowing as they put forth buds. The peach blossoms bloom in wild profusion, and since it is the height of spring, there should be nothing sad about it. In this way the flowers bloom joyfully because it is spring, and people too find pleasure and consolation thinking it is spring. It's not that the spring wind doesn't blow, but why won't it blow away my sorrows? Because of the length of spring days, from morning until evening, sorrow alone clings fast and will not depart.

Song of Following the Army (Jūgunkō)　　　　By Wang Changling (Ōshōrei)

At the beacon tower, a hundred feet high west of the fortress,
At dusk I sit alone as autumn winds blow from the sea.
Moreover, someone plays the Qiang flute—
The tune "Moon over the Frontier Mountains"—
There is nothing I can do about
The sorrow of the golden chamber ten thousand li away.

A small fortress is built so the barbarians cannot detect it, called a beacon fortress, and around the place where beacon fires are lit for vigilance, defenses are set up so people cannot pass through. Having come here with the army and sitting alone, autumn winds blow from the direction of the barbarians, creating an eerie atmosphere. Just seeing such a landscape is enough, but sadly for this person, from somewhere comes the sound of a flute playing. Since it plays the tune "Moon over the Frontier Mountains," though I myself don't mind it, feelings of longing for home arise and there is nothing I can do about it. "Golden chamber" refers to one's wife and children. Beacon fires are signals for distant lookout posts. For details, see the annotated commentaries or lecture editions.

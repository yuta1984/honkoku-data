One branch richly beautiful, dew congealing fragrance
Clouds and rain of Mount Wu, wrongly causing heartbreak
I ask: Who in the Han palace could resemble her?
The lovely Zhao Feiyan adorning herself with new makeup

Just one branch of peony, but its beautiful color and luster causes dew to condense and become fragrant. This represents Consort Yang Guifei in the prime of her years. Like this flower, the beauty is truly magnificent. Since Guifei has been painted, those who longed for the goddess of Mount Wu were mistaken in their heartbroken yearning. The goddess of Mount Wu refers to the story where King Xiang of Chu made a pact with a goddess in a dream, and she said she would "come as clouds and rain." Is there no beauty like Guifei in the Tang era? Since it's said there were many beauties in the Han palace, I would like to ask. If the lovely Zhao Feiyan came adorning herself with makeup, she might resemble her somewhat. But with that face, she could hardly match Guifei. "Leaning on" means to rely upon. Feiyan was a consort of Emperor Cheng of Han.

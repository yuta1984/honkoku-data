Spring Palace Song by Wang Changling

Last night the wind opened the peach blossoms by the dew-covered well; before Weiyang Palace, the moon hung high
The Pingyang dancers newly receive favor; outside the curtain in the spring cold, brocade robes are bestowed

Last night, with the warm wind, the peach blossoms in the garden also opened, and the emperor went out to view the flowers. Entertainment was held before Weiyang Palace, and the moon being high and bright indicates it was late at night. Because of this spring cold, the newly-arrived court lady has gained favor, and outside the curtains, without regard for the other palace women, the emperor newly bestows his affection on the newcomer. Details can be found in commentaries and historical records.

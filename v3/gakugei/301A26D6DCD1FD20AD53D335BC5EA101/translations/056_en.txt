Remembering My Brothers on the Ninth Day of the Ninth Month - Wang Wei

Alone in a foreign land, I am a stranger;
Every time I encounter a festive season, I think of my family all the more.
From afar I know my brothers climb to high places,
Inserting dogwood everywhere, but missing one person.

This is a poem composed while in a foreign country. It is a work from when Wang Wei was seventeen years old. While his parents, brothers, and friends are all in his hometown, he alone has become a traveler in a foreign land, living a transient life. On the ninth day (the Double Ninth Festival), they are surely all drinking wine together, but since I alone am absent from among the brothers, they must be longing for me - or so he hopes they think of him. From his side, his yearning for them comes through all the more strongly. "Qin" (family) refers to parents, brothers, and the entire household.

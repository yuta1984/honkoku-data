The Second Poem

The sun sets as drums and horns sound at the camp gate
Thousands bound face-to-face emerge from the barbarian city
Washing soldiers, clouds welcome the formation at Fish Sea
Feeding horses at Dragon Mound, the moon illuminates the camp

【Reading】
The sun sets at the camp gate, drums and horns sound. Thousands bound face-to-face emerge from the barbarian city. Washing soldiers at Fish Sea, clouds welcome the formation. Feeding horses at Dragon Mound, the moon illuminates the camp.

【Commentary】
The camp gate (enmon) is the entrance to the military encampment. At evening time, they return from the victorious battle beating drums. The surrendering barbarian captives have their hands tied in front and are being led out from the barbarian city.

Today, fortunately, when they arrived at the Fish Sea area, clouds and rain came down as if welcoming our formation - this appeared to be auspicious rain for cleansing the soldiers. Since the barbarian war has ended, there are no worries, and when feeding the horses around Dragon Mound, the moon shines upon the camp. For details, one should consult the vernacular commentary.

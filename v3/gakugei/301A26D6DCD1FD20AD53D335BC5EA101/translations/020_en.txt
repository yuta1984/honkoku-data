Song of the Emperor's Western Journey to Nanjing

Li Bai

Who says the sovereign's journey is difficult? Six dragons travel west and ten thousand people rejoice
The earth turns, making the Jin River into the Wei River; heaven revolves, making the Jade Ramparts into Chang'an

Part Two
Jiange's layered passes are Shu's northern gate, the returning horses of the Supreme Emperor mass like clouds
The Young Emperor opens the Purple Forbidden City in Chang'an, hanging sun and moon together to illuminate heaven and earth

Who would say that the sovereign's journey is difficult? The imperial carriage (six dragons) travels west and ten thousand people rejoice.
The earth transforms, turning the Jin River into the Wei River; heaven revolves, making the jade fortress into Chang'an.

Part Two
The multiple barriers of Jiange are the northern gate of Shu; the Supreme Emperor's returning horses mass like gathering clouds.
The Young Emperor opens the Purple Forbidden City in Chang'an, suspending sun and moon together to illuminate the universe.

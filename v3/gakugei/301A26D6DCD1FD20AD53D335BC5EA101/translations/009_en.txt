"Playfully Presented to the Beauty of Zhao Shijun" by Du Shenyan

Rouge-powdered maiden reflects in the Chu clouds; peach-blossom horse with pomegranate skirt.
Luofu alone departs toward the east; vainly learning from other families to become a lord's wife.

This is playfully - meaning jokingly - presented as a poem to the beautiful wife of Zhao Shijun. On a fine day around the spring equinox, she went out beautifully made up. "Chu clouds" also refers to the goddess of Mount Wu, and she is so beautiful that she rivals even the Chu clouds.

That beauty rides a peach-blossom colored horse, wearing a pomegranate-colored underskirt. Usually she would go out accompanied by her lord husband, but today she goes alone. It's rare to see her as the wife of another family's Zhao Shijun, and even the attendants would desire her company. This refers to the historical tale of King Zhao.

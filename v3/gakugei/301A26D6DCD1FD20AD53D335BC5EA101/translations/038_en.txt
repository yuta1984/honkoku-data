Autumn Poem of Changxin Palace by Wang Changling

This poem depicts the waning of Consort Ban's favor. "Zhencheng" originally means "truly," and refers to her unfortunate fate.

Truly of ill fate, long have I pondered in thought; dreaming of the sovereign, I doubt after waking
Fire illuminates the Western Palace, revealing night banquets; clearly I remember the time of receiving favor in the covered corridors

I am truly ill-fated and have been troubled by thoughts for a long time. I dream of the emperor but doubt upon waking.
Fire lights up the Western Palace, revealing nighttime festivities. What I remember clearly is the time when I received imperial favor in the palace corridors.

(Commentary from small print annotations)
In the heart of the once-happy Consort Ban, whose favor has waned, she thinks herself ill-fated. She has long pondered whether her favor has truly declined, unable to reach a conclusion. For a while in her dream, she clearly met with her lord and was shown affection, but upon waking she found it was false. She wonders whether this was a dream or not. After awakening, looking carefully from Changxin Palace, she sees fire illuminating the area around Zhaoyang Palace and the Western Palace. Perhaps the emperor is having entertainments and evening banquets there. However, unlike when she clearly received imperial favor in the past, now she wishes to see him again, but it was not like a dream. Yet upon waking, she sees the emperor's palace is over there. How truly heartbreaking this is! Details are found in the commentaries.

Parting drunk from the riverside pavilion, fragrant with oranges and pomelos,
River winds bring rain into the boat, cool and refreshing.
I think of you far away beneath the moon over Mount Xiang,
Grieving to hear clear gibbons' cries long through dreams.

Bidding Farewell to Wei San - Wang Changling

[Illustration]

Now that you are departing for Changsha, we hold a farewell banquet and part in drunkenness from this riverside pavilion. Since it is autumn, oranges and pomelos are ripe and fragrant. River winds blow over the boat you will board from this place, bringing rain and coolness. Thinking of the various provinces where you are bound - when you reach the area around Mount Xiang, even seeing the moon will move you deeply, and if through your dreaming nights you hear the clear, penetrating cries of gibbons echoing long, you will be unable to sleep and will grieve. How pitiful it is.

【Chinese Poem Section】
Going to the Northern Court, crossing Long Ridge while thinking of home
Facing west toward Luntai, more than ten thousand li away
I also know that news from my hometown will become increasingly sparse day by day
The parrots of Long Mountain can speak well
Tell them to report to my family to send letters frequently
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Cen Can

【Commentary Section】
As I go to this place, looking toward Luntai in the west, it is indeed ten thousand li and very far away. Even here there are no messages, so increasingly the news from my hometown will become more distant, and hearing from home will become rare. The area around Long Mountain is where parrots live. From now on, thinking this will be a place without postal communication, I ask (the parrot) to tell my wife and children back home to send letters. Perhaps only one out of ten will reach me - this is truly a place without reliable communication. Unless one has wings like a parrot to fly here, there is no other way. For details, consult the Kokushikai (Japanese commentary).

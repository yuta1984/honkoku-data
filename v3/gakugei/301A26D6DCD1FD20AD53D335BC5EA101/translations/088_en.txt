Again Presented to Zheng Lian by Du Fu

Master Zheng is about to depart, resigning from his official position
In his bag there is not one thing to offer to his honored parents
The rivers and mountains make the road long, days of separation and travel
Who will be the one with fine robes and horses to help this man of integrity?

This person is about to go to his hometown and resign from office to depart. Because he is a person of integrity, he did not exploit the people and has not a single coin saved, nor any gifts for his parents in his hometown. From here, the road back to his hometown is also far, crossing rivers and mountains. "Qiuma" refers to a person of refinement. In the capital there are quite a few refined people, but none who are moved by this person's poverty and integrity to pity and help him - this is truly an unavoidable situation.

"Qili" refers to circumstances along the road when departing on a journey. For details, see the Tang Poetry Commentary.

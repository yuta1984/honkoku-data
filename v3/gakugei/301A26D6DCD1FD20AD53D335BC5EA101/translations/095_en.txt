Seeking Li Jiuzhuang on the Third Day - by Chang Jian

Rain ceases, willow grove at Eastern Ferry
On the third day of Yonghe, rowing a light boat
My old friend's house is on the peach blossom shore
Arriving directly at his gate where stream waters flow

It had been raining until evening, but this morning it cleared up all the way to the eastern ferry where the willows grow. Since today is the third day of the Shangsi Festival, just as Wang Xizhi once played at Lanting during the Yonghe era long ago, I too row out in a light boat to visit my friends.

Wondering where my old friend's house might be, I see it's on the shore lined with blooming peach blossoms. If I float my boat on this water, I'll arrive directly at his gate. The scenery is so tranquil that it's like arriving at the peach blossom spring of Wuling - this is the meaning conveyed in this poem. Details can be found in the Chinese poetry commentary.

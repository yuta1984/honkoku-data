First Arriving at Baling, Floating on Dongting Lake Together with Li Twelve Bai - by Jia Zhi

On the maple shores, leaves fall in profusion, autumn waters of Dongting have waves in the evening light.
Riding our fancy on a light boat with no distinction of near or far, white clouds and bright moon mourn for Xiangé.

Having been demoted and sent to the Baling area in the southern provinces.

"Maple shores in profusion" - these are all words from the Songs of Chu. Being autumn time, the maple leaves on the shore also scatter in profusion, and with fallen leaves the water surface has become lonely. Seeing the waves rise because autumn winds blow, one somehow recalls the story of Qu Yuan.

Being in the condition of demotion, neither of us finds peace of mind - we are in the same circumstances as Qu Yuan.

Riding in the boat without distinction of distance, drifting endlessly like this, through the night under bright moon with clearing white clouds, it would be like mourning at the shrine of Lord Xiang.

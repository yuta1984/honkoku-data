"Presented to Su Guan, the Secretary" by Du Shenyan

I know that you as secretary are naturally elegant and talented; being appointed for Xu's sake to follow the military to the northern frontier. In the rouge-powdered tower, she should be counting the days; do not spend years beneath Mount Yanzhi.

I know that you are naturally elegant and talented as a secretary. It is only natural that you have been appointed to this secretarial position, following the military to serve the general in the northern barbarian lands.

Your wife will surely be counting the days in her beautiful mansion, waiting for your return. Please be careful not to linger long around Mount Yanzhi.

That area is barbarian territory and extremely dangerous, so you should return quickly. You must not stay there long - though even if I say this, you probably won't listen to me, so I'm just timidly offering this advice. How amusing! Details can be found in the classical commentaries and annotations.

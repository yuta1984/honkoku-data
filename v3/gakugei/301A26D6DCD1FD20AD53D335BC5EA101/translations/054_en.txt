Parting Again from Li Pingshi (Magistrate Li) - Wang Changling

Do not say that autumn river partings are difficult,
Tomorrow the boat will indeed head to Chang'an.
Let the Wu songstresses dance slowly to detain you and make you drunk,
Let it be as you will - the cold of green maples and white dew.

(Marginal note: Because the departure has been postponed repeatedly, parting two or three times is called "repeated parting.")

(Marginal note: Since our previous farewell, we have been enjoying the autumn river scenery together until now, so I had relied on the idea that we wouldn't part hastily. But tomorrow we must indeed separate. Don't speak of it! Because tomorrow you will board the boat and go to Chang'an, tonight let us at least leisurely have the courtesans dance and hold a drinking party. Please enjoy yourself! Even if it's cold under the shade of the green maples by this parting riverside, let it be as fate wills - let us cherish these final moments and hold our drinking party.)

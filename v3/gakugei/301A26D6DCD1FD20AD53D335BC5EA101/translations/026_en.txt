Seeing off Meng Haoran departing for Guangling at Yellow Crane Tower
My old friend departs westward from Yellow Crane Tower
In the third month of misty flowers, heading down to Yangzhou
The distant shadow of a lone sail disappears into the blue sky
I only see the Yangtze River flowing to the horizon

At Yellow Crane Tower, seeing off Meng Haoran going to Guangling, an old friend
Departing westward from Yellow Crane Tower
In the third month of misty flowers, heading down to Yangzhou  
The distant shadow of a lone sail disappears into the blue sky
I only see the Yangtze River flowing to the horizon

There is a friend there. In pleasant excursion, what cannot be seen is that there is nothing else but the flowing river. The river becomes one with heaven, and what can only be seen is the Yangtze River. It becomes one with the blue and cannot be seen, but can it be seen? While watching, only the wake of the departing boat can be seen in the sky. There is nothing else. The boat goes down... after three years from here, you abandon this view and take the boat downstream. If we could view this scenery together, how interesting it would be, but from here with your dear friend, this misty flowers of Yellow Crane Tower...

Sending to the Mountain Hermit Sun　by Chu Guangxi

In the second month at Xinlin, the solitary boat returns, water fills the clear river, flowers fill the mountains.
I ask about the reclusive gentleman of the old garden, does he sometimes come and go, dwelling among people?

Xinlin is a place name. Thinking that the spring scenery would be beautiful, I poled my boat back to the shores of Xinlin in my hometown in the second month. The spring water appears to flow clear and abundant, and flowers are in full bloom, visible blooming on all the mountains. Surely Master Sun must also be viewing this. Wanting very much to meet him, I searched for him, but unexpectedly he had gone somewhere and was not there. Being a reclusive gentleman, one would not expect him to be involved with the mundane world, but does he perhaps also maintain a dwelling among ordinary people? It is impossible to know.

"Crossing the Xiang River" by Du Shenyan

In the late spring sunlight of gardens and groves, I grieve for past pleasures; this spring the flowers and birds create sorrow at the border. I alone pity that people from the capital are banished to the south - unlike the waters of the Xiang River that flow northward.

Last year when I enjoyed myself in the capital, it was delightful, but having been demoted to the southern provinces, when I see the scenery of flowers and birds in the gardens under this late spring sun, if I were in the capital this landscape would surely be enjoyable. But being a traveler, seeing this scenery makes me remember past pleasures and instead increases my melancholy. I am a person from the northern capital, but being banished to the south is unlike the Xiang River's water flowing north - I cannot even imitate the water's freedom, how enviable that is! Details can be found in the classical commentaries and annotations.

Passing by the Forest Pavilion of Recluse Cui Xingzong with Court Gentleman Lu Xiang - Wang Wei

Green trees with layered shade cover the four neighbors,
Blue moss grows thicker day by day, naturally free of dust.
Hair disheveled, sitting cross-legged beneath tall pines,
Looking at other worldly people with disdainful eyes.

Recluse Cui does not serve in government office but has secluded himself in places like mountain forests. Green trees grow in many layers, and though there may be neighboring houses around, they cannot be seen because the green trees cover them - it is a quiet place. The blue moss and grass in the garden, with no human traffic and no sweeping or cleaning, naturally remain free of dust. Being a noble person, he rarely associates with ordinary people.

"Ke tou" means letting one's hair hang loose. "Ji ju" means stretching out one's legs. Being a refined person with no worldly desires, he wears no cap, lets his hair hang loose, and stretches out his legs beneath tall pines. This describes his appearance of being completely unconcerned with everything. Since there is no one among worldly people who pleases him, he glares at them with disdain, so no one comes to visit.

For details, one should seek and examine works such as "Zhangu," "Jianzhu," and "Kokuji-kai" from Suzanbo Publishing House.

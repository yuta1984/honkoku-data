Resolving Melancholy by Du Fu

Once having left my native land, I have experienced ten autumns
Every time I see autumn melons, I remember my old home
Today at South Lake I gather bracken and ferns
Who will seek out Zheng Guazhou for me?

Having left my hometown, I have been a traveler for a long time, now ten years. Since it is autumn, and Du Fu's birthplace was famous for melons, whenever I see melons, I wonder if there are still good melons in my village. Today I came to the South Lake area, and finding no melons familiar from my hometown, but instead it being early spring when one gathers bracken, I am reminded entirely of my hometown. I wish I could at least meet my friend Zheng Guazhou to find some comfort, but I cannot meet him. Who will search for him and bring him to meet me? No one will bring him to me. "Zheng Guazhou" is a nickname - if he could bring me melons like those from my hometown, my sorrows might be resolved. For details, one should consult books of Tang poetry commentary.

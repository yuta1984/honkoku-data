At Yueyang Tower, Holding Another Farewell Banquet for Wang Ba Yuanwai Who is Being Demoted to Changsha

The river route stretches east for a thousand li of tides,
Looking north at blue clouds, the Purple Forbidden Star is distant,
Do not speak of Baling's lake waters being vast—
South of Changsha is even more desolate.

By Jia Zhi

Yueyang Tower is located to the northwest, while Changsha is at the southern edge of Dongting Lake's waters, so it lies even further south than where Yueyang Tower stands. In the northern part of Dongting Lake, river waters flow continuously, and when viewed from Yueyang Tower, the waters of Dongting stretch eastward without end, with tides filling the vast expanse for a thousand li. As one travels by boat through this area and looks up at the blue clouds in the sky, gazing toward the northern capital, the stars of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure above the capital appear distant and indistinct. Both of us have come to this distant place far from the capital.

From the empty west to the north, nothing obstructs the view. Though the Yuanwai holds good rank and fortune, the journey from Yueyang to Changsha crosses nothing but continuous lake waters—one could board a boat in the morning and return by evening, they say. Yet even the Yueyang area feels lonely. When you go further east to the area south of Changsha, the capital will become even more distant and your heart will grow ever more heavy.

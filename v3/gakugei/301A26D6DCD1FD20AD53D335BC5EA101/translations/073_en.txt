"Written at Jade Gate, Sent to Registrar Li of Chang'an" by Cen Shen

Eastward from Chang'an I have traveled more than ten thousand li
Old friend, why do you begrudge sending even a single line?
Looking west from Jade Gate, my heart breaks with sorrow
How much more so when tomorrow is New Year's Eve

【Modern Translation and Commentary】
Traveling eastward from Chang'an for more than ten thousand li to the frontier realm of the barbarians, reaching even Jade Gate - you there should at least send me a letter. Why don't you write even a single line?

From Jade Gate looking ahead, I don't know how much farther there is to go, but thinking that I must proceed to that place, it feels as if my entrails might snap. Please understand this sorrow of mine. With this sadness alone, encountering New Year's Eve while traveling and having to pass the year in this way only increases the grief all the more. For details, see the previous annotations.

Song of Youth - Wang Wei

From humble birth serving the Han as a Yulin Guard initially,
Following the General of Swift Cavalry to battle at Yuyang.
Who knows that I do not go toward the frontier courts?
I do not suffer - even if I die, I would still hear of the fragrant chivalrous bones.

"Chushen" (humble birth) refers to one's background and status. Children whose parents died in battle are made Yulin Guards and taken into service, where they are trained in martial arts and such. I too, from my youth, was employed as a Yulin military official serving the imperial court. Initially I followed generals like the General of Swift Cavalry into battle. If people were to observe from the sidelines, they would think I fought desperately around Yuyang, but I do not fight by throwing away my life. I will not waste my life against barbarian enemies. Even if I were to die, unless I achieve such merit that I would be called unparalleled in the capital, and unless my name becomes so fragrant that even my bones are renowned after death, it would not be worthwhile.

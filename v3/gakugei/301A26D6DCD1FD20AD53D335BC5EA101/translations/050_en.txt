Sending Off Xin Jian at Furong Tower - Wang Changling

Cold rain stretches across the river, entering Wu at night;
At dawn I send off a guest, and Mount Chu stands alone.
If friends in Luoyang should ask about me,
Tell them my heart is like a piece of ice in a jade pot.

I now imagine myself as Xin Jian, traveling from Chu to Wu at night along the riverside path, beaten by rain in this cold, wet season. Here I met this person (Xin Jian) and climbed Furong Tower. At dawn, as I send off my guest, I see a solitary mountain in the direction of Chu, which makes my feelings of separation all the more intense. If that person reaches Luoyang and friends ask "How is he? What is he doing?", tell them: "In the past when I lived in the capital, I relied on pursuing elegance and refinement, but now my heart is pure like ice in a jade pot, and since I no longer seek such refinements, I have no intention of returning to the capital."

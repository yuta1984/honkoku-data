Gazing at Mount Tianmen

Tianmen breaks in the middle, the Chu River opens wide
Blue waters flow eastward, reaching north and turning back
Green mountains on both banks face each other emerging
A lone sail, single piece, comes from the direction of the sun

Mount Tianmen has Bowang Mountain to the east and Liang Mountain to the west. Between them flows the river called Chu River. Looking at the surface of the blue waters, they flow eastward and circulate northward. "Direction of the sun" refers to the capital. Li Bai came from the capital to this place and gazes at Mount Tianmen from his boat. This expresses his feelings upon first arriving at this location. "Direction of the sun" doesn't mean he came directly from the capital. With no other boats visible, only our boat, he uses the word "single piece" with this sentiment. Coming to such a place is a joyful thing.

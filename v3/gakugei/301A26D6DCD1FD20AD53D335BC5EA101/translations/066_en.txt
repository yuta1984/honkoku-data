Spring View from the Western Pavilion - by Jia Zhi

The days are long and the wind warm, willows verdant green; northern geese return flying into the distant void.
Atop Yueyang Castle, hearing the flute played, it can well fill Dongting Lake with springtime feelings.

Because of the warm spring season, the willows also bud verdantly green, and the wild geese return north. Since spring is already ending, the geese also take flight into the endless vast sky. With no news from home, one thinks of the capital.

Within this "spring heart" (feelings for spring) various things are contained. Thoughts of demotion and the sorrow of lamenting spring are also included. When one's heart is already heavy, hearing the flute stirs up melancholy, and when spring-sensing feelings fill Dongting Lake, everywhere becomes filled with sorrow.

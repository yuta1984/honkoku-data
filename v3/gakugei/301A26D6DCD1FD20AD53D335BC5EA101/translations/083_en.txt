"Composed After Getting Drunk at a Banquet by the Governor of Jiuquan" by Cen Can

The governor of Jiuquan is skilled at sword dancing, wine is set in the high hall and drums beaten at night.
One tune of the barbarian reed pipe breaks people's hearts, the seated guests look at each other with tears like rain.

This is a military banquet, so it cannot be lukewarm - they perform sword dances and such. They bring them out frequently, hence the word "skilled." Even at night they go up to the hall and have banquets until dawn. When they sing, at first everyone enjoys themselves carelessly. Up to this point the mood has been cheerful, but when the dance ends, the sound of the barbarian reed pipe (hujia) can be heard. Hearing this evokes sorrow, and those seated look at each other's faces, remembering their hometowns, and shed tears streaming down.

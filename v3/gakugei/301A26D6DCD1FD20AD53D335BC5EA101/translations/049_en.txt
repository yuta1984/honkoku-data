Liang Garden (Ryōen)

The autumn bamboo of Liang Garden, smoke of ancient times;
Outside the castle walls, the wind grieves as heaven desires to darken.
Where now are the banners and flags of ten thousand chariots?
Who will pity the guests of the Ping Terrace?

The bamboo of Liang Garden remains unchanged from ancient times, growing thickly just as in the time of Prince Xiao. The scenery is the same as in ancient times. How splendid it must have been in Prince Xiao's time!

Looking outside the castle walls, as evening approaches, an eerie autumn wind blows, creating a desolate and melancholy scene. In Prince Xiao's prosperous time, he was like the emperor himself, so he imitated the style of the ten-thousand-chariot Son of Heaven, but now there is no trace left. At that time, he welcomed and cherished literary talents like Sima Xiangru and Zou Yang. If there were someone like Prince Xiao now, we too would wish to be employed like Xiangru and others. For details, one should consult historical records or commentary books.

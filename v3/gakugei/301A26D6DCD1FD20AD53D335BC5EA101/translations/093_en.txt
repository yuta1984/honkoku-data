Part Two

From the northern sea, cold winds stir the earth as they come
Above the shrine of the Enlightened Ruler, gazing toward Dragon Mound
Skulls are all that remain of the Great Wall soldiers
At evening in the sandy battlefield, they fly up as ash

The Shrine of the Enlightened Ruler (Meikun-shi) refers to the temple of Zhaojun (Wang Zhaojun). From the northern sea of the barbarian lands, fierce cold winds blow, stirring the earth. Dragon Mound (Ryūtai) is in the desert, called so because it resembles the shape of a dragon. It is an endless, desolate place. Since ancient times, soldiers who came from the capital to this place and died in battle - with no one to tend to their corpses - have left only white bones behind. When viewed at dusk, they have become dust and are blown away by the wind. We who have come to this frontier will likely meet the same fate, and the emotion is unbearable.

For details, one should consult the Kokuji-kai (vernacular commentary).

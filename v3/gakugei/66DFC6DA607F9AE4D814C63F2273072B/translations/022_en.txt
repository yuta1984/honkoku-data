During the spring and autumn equinoxes, there is a practice called "Roku Amida Meguri" (pilgrimage to six Amida temples). Enticed by the beautiful and warm sunlight, people of all social classes in Edo - noble and common, old and young - gather in groups and set out early in the morning from their homes. However, since the journey is long, even the leisurely spring days do not feel long enough, and autumn days especially seem to grow dark quickly.

From the "Kaikoku Zakki" (Record of Travels Around the Country), a poem composed upon arriving at Omoi River:
"On this melancholy journey's path flows Omoi River—are my tear-soaked sleeves the very source of its waters?" by Dōkō Jugo
(Thus he arrived at the banks of the Sumida River)

Sumida River Ferry - This is an ancient ferry crossing from Hashiba to the base of Sumida Embankment. It is now called Hashiba Ferry. (A publication called "Edo Kanoko" from the Genroku period states that elderly locals tell of how the old ferry crossing was located slightly upriver from the present location. In ancient times it may have been called "Suda Ferry," as there is a poem by Tsunekane in the "Fuboku-shō")
(recorded next)
(In the "Kokin-shū": Upon arriving at the banks of the Sumida River between Musashi and Shimōsa provinces, feeling deeply homesick for the capital, I sat by the riverbank for a while lost in thought, realizing how incredibly far I had traveled, and as I gazed melancholically, the ferryman called "Hurry aboard! The sun has set!" So as I was about to board the ferry to cross, everyone felt sorrowful, for we all had people we longed for in the capital. At that moment, white birds with red beaks and legs were playing by the river. Since these were birds not seen in the capital, no one recognized them, so we asked the ferryman "What kind of birds are these?" and he replied "These are miyako-dori (capital birds)." Upon hearing this, I composed:)
"If you bear that name, then I must ask, capital bird—does the one I love still live or not?"
(In the "Azuma-ji no Ki" (Record of the Eastern Road): Hearing that the Sumida River was near, I went to see it. Even now they say "Board the boat"—perhaps this is the habit of this ferryman?)
"This indeed is that ferry crossing at Sumida River Plain that I had thought of longingly from distant eastern roads" - Chōshō
"Without asking, I'll simply trust in it, Sumida River—lest the flocking birds bear false names" - Same author
(On the return journey, there is a Buddha at Asakusa Kannon who is revered and cherished throughout the country...)

From "Fuboku-shō":
"Though Suda Ferry cannot be seen through the evening mist, the voices of boatmen calling can still be heard" - Tsunekane

Ishihama Ancient Battlefield - The entire area of Hashiba is similar to what was called Ishihama. (There is a study of Ishihama by Master Hakuseki in "Shin'an Shukan," but it is omitted here)
According to the "Taiheiki," in the intercalary second month of Shōhei 7 (1352) (the year of the Northern Court's Kannō 3, when the era was changed to Bunwa), the late Nitta Yoshisada's second son Saemon-no-suke Yoshioki, third son Shōshō Yoshimune, and cousin Saemon Yoshiharu raised a righteous army. With a force of over 100,000 cavalry, they advanced into Musashi Province. In response, Shogun Takauji also departed from Kamakura, and on the 16th day of the same month, with only about 500 cavalry, he set out for Musashi Province to await the enemy on the road and decide the battle. Gradually assembling forces totaled over 80,000 cavalry, so on the 20th day they advanced to Kotesashi Plain in Musashi, where the combined Nitta and Ashikaga forces of 200,000 cavalry engaged in fierce battle. When the Ashikaga vanguard was suddenly defeated and retreated, the rear guard could not advance and suffered a great rout. Yoshimune personally led his various armies and shouted loudly: "For the realm they are enemies of the court, and for me they are my father's foes! If I do not see Takauji's head in this battle, what other time should I expect?" Following only the retreat of the great banner with two horizontal bars, they pursued from Kotesashi Plain to Ishihama—already 46 ri along the Bandō road—catching up in just one hour. At this time the Shogun crossed Ishihama and escaped the crisis. (The Tenshō edition says Sumida River.) Still, the Shogun's troops...

Without using hands, people push against each other using only their shoulders as they proceed, which is why this is called the "Oshiai Festival" (Pushing Festival), as recorded in the "Shiseki Gōkō." The shrine possesses an ancient portable shrine (mikoshi) with an inscription inside the roof stating "Made by Takasu Mimasaka, resident of Yamashiro Province, in the fourth month of Tenshō 15 (1587)." Another ridge plaque from the same year bears the name "Suzuki Saburō Kanja Iehira." This is the name of the shrine's head priest, as the Suzuki family has served in this capacity for generations.

Tenman-gū Shrine (Located to the right of the main shrine, the divine image is said to be a true work of Sugawara no Michizane, and it was established through the solicitation of Former Minister of the Left Takatsuji Ienaga on the fifth day of the sixth month of Meiwa 4 (1767). The plaque reads "Tenman-gū" and is written by Takatsuji Shikibu-taifu Hisanaga Ason. There are many other subsidiary shrines, but they are omitted here.)

This shrine was a prosperous location during the Kenkyū and Shōji periods (late 12th to early 13th century). At that time it was a major shrine, and people from the Kantō region who found it difficult to make pilgrimage to Ise Shrine would visit this shrine to receive purification rites. Particularly the Chiba and Utsunomiya clans showed devotion and donated sacred rice fields. This area was formerly on the Ōshū Highway, and during the Bunji period, Minamoto no Yoritomo, the Right General of Kamakura, is said to have visited this shrine. The precincts are filled with many trees growing luxuriantly. Every year on the last day of the sixth month, the Nagoshi purification ritual is performed. The festival is held on September 16th (on this day, ginger is sold within the shrine grounds, which is why it is commonly called the "Ginger Festival").

Massaki Inari Myōjin Shrine - Located in the same area, facing the flow of the Sumida River. The enshrined deity is Ukanomitama no Mikoto. According to shrine tradition:
Long ago, the house of Chiba no Suke Kanetane possessed a sacred jewel. Through the protection of this sacred jewel, they gained honor as vanguard warriors in numerous battles. In the generation of Moritane, when he became lord of Ishihama Castle, he enshrined Inari with this precious jewel as the castle's tutelary deity and named it Massaki Inari Myōjin. (In past years, during the construction of the main shrine,

the shrine's eaves were supported by the sacred keyaki tree, making construction difficult, so when they excavated the ground behind it, they discovered this sacred jewel. Therefore, it is now kept in the shrine hall, and on every Horse Day of each month, faithful devotees are allowed to worship this sacred treasure.)

The plaque on the main shrine reading "Masaki Inari Daimyōjin" is written by Urabe no Ason Kaneo, the Shinto Ceremonial Chief.

The Sacred Keyaki Tree (Located in front of the main shrine, covering the eaves. A sacred spring bubbles up from the hollow of the trunk, and it is said that sick people who drink from it receive healing.)

In front of this shrine flows the famous Sumida River, flowing gently day and night. The eaves of restaurants and sake shops face the river surface, capturing the scenic beauty of all four seasons. Especially on summer days, cups are washed in the current to dispel the heat, and on autumn nights, poles are pushed into the midstream to admire the moon. From the enchanting cherry blossoms of Sumida Embankment in spring evenings to the brilliant white snow of Shirahige and Mokuboji temples on winter mornings, the views are all extraordinary, making this truly an excellent place for entertainment and banquets.

Omoi River - This refers to a small tidal inlet that crosses the road from in front of the Inari shrine to the Hashiba ferry crossing. In Jishō 4 (1180), Kamakura Shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo passed through this area and had his horse washed in the river water, which is why local people say it is also called Koma-arai River (Horse-washing River).

(Upon consideration, the "Azuma Kagami" records that on the 27th day of the 10th month of Jishō 4, Yoritomo personally departed to pursue Satake Kanja Hideyoshi, arriving at Hitachi Provincial Office on the 4th day of the 11th month of the same year. This may refer to events from that time. Also, the "Hōjō Kudai-ki" records that on the 19th day of the 7th month of Bunji 5, Yoritomo crossed the Sumida River when departing to pursue Fujiwara no Yasuhira of Ōshū. Since this area was on the ancient Ōshū Highway, such events would indeed have been possible.)

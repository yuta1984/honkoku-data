They peel thinly with a thin blade, cutting in a spiral from the mouth as shown in the diagram. On Teshima in Bungo Province, they spread them on straw mats to dry, so each bears the pattern of the mat weave. Having head and tail ends is for bundling them. Now, calling this "noshi" comes from the fact that in ancient times it was called uchi-awabi (beaten abalone) and was beaten and stretched like beaten chestnuts (uchi-kuri), then cut, so it was called "noshi," and was also called hoshi-awabi (dried abalone).

○Both dried abalone (hoshi-awabi) and beaten abalone (uchi-awabi) were food items of ancient times. It was also called thin abalone (usu-awabi). In the Kōshidai, the four types of sacred food for the taboo-fire rice were thin abalone, dried sea bream, sardines, and horse mackerel. The current use as decorations or ornamental noshi at celebratory occasions originated from Ashikaga Shogun Yoshimitsu's orders to Imagawa Sakyō-no-dayū Ujiyori, Ogasawara Hyūgo-no-suke Nagahide, Ise Musashi-no-kami Mitsutada and others, dividing the warrior houses of the realm into eleven ranks and establishing protocols for imperial family, daimyo, provincial governors, outsider lords, and council members. This is recorded in the "Sangi Ittō." In ancient times, there was dried abalone offered at Emperor Tenji's Daijōsai ceremony, and it was included in all divine offerings for various festivals in the Engi-shiki. First, Ise Province is the divine capital of our country with the most shrine enshrinements, hence why it is produced in Ise. One should also know that it was not merely decorative but was actual food.

Furthermore, even through the Kamakura period and beyond, it was constantly used primarily as food. The evidence for this is in the "Heiji Monogatari," in the section on Yoritomo's exile.

○The Suke-dono (Yoritomo) stayed overnight at Takebe Myōjin shrine in Ōmi Province to pray for safe travel. After people had quieted that night, his retainer Moriyasu said: "The reason I advised against your taking Buddhist vows in the capital was that I received a mysterious prophetic dream. You visited Hachiman shrine in pure white robes and sat on the great platform. I, Moriyasu, was in attendance, prostrating on the many stone pavements, when a child of about twelve or thirteen appeared holding a bow and arrows, standing on the great platform and saying, 'Summon Yoshitomo's bow and quiver.' Then from within the treasure hall came a noble voice saying, 'Store it deeply away. Eventually it shall be given to Yoritomo. Feed this to Yoritomo.' A heavenly child brought something and offered it before the deity. When I looked to see what it was, it was something called uchi-awabi (beaten abalone). [middle section omitted] 'Eat that,' was commanded, and when counted there were sixty-six pieces. Grasping that noshi-abalone in both hands, he ate three bites of the thick parts and gave the thin parts to Moriyasu

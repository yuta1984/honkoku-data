Three boats are tied to both ends of one side of the rope. The first two boats have a crew of three people each: two people pull the rope, and one person uses a oak stick or mallet to beat drums to prevent the fish from scattering. One of these three boats is called "katsura-bune," the second is called "naka-bune" (middle boat), and the one that advances first is called "ami-bune" (net boat). The net boat has a crew of eight people: one person waves a command baton, and seven people handle the oars. Another boat stays outside the center of the "buri-nawa" (yellowtail rope) to prevent the rope from sinking, and also has an additional rope attached as a control line. Of its three crew members, one handles the rope, one handles the oars, and one waves a baton to signal the right timing. When the two net boats that advanced first wave their batons from the left side of the "buri-nawa" and push their oars to row toward the "hikae-bune" (control boat), the control boat rows into the center of the "buri-nawa." The net boats separate to the left and right of the rope to face each other, lean against the "buri-nawa" from around the "hikae-nawa" (control rope), slide the net down to the outer side of the yellowtail school, and pull from both sides. Seeing this, the initial two boats at both ends release the rope, which is then hauled up into the control boat. After that, only the nets are rowed closer and closer until finally

The two net boats position their bows in alternating fashion, close in, and tighten the net. The fish also leap up as if boiling, diving under the net and sticking their heads out, shaking their tails here and there, flashing like lightning. The fishermen scoop them up with hand nets and transfer them to small collection boats. The collection boats have three crew members, all handling oars to row toward the shore. This method of catching is called "gochi-ami" (five-wisdom net).

The length of the aforementioned "furi-nawa" is approximately 320 fathoms, the large net is 15 fathoms, with a depth of 8 fathoms in the center, then 4 fathoms, then 3 fathoms. Made with the finest hemp, the mesh size is seven finger-widths. There are floats but no buoys. The sinkers are made by creating bamboo rings, adding stones inside them, and tying them with thread like the tuning of a drum. The nets are made by joining multiple sections called "one mat," "two mats," and so on to make them wider. The quick technique of tying and connecting takes less than an instant. One "mat" is about 4 ken wide and hangs down about 10 ken.

○ A thing called "snake bone" is abundant in Shirahama in the same province. Therefore, it is often caught mixed in with this "gochi-ami."

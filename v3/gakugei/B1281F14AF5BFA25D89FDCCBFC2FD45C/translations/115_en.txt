These three types are all different varieties of the same fish. In spring they appear at the boundary between salt and fresh water, and ice fish (hiu-wo) appear in winter at the turbulent boundaries of lakes and in the Uji River and Tanakami - the principle is the same for all. Dorome are juvenile ayu (sweetfish). Since ayu are annual fish that live only one year, when they become heavy with spawn in the upper reaches, they descend toward the sea in autumn and spawn at the salt-fresh water boundary. Therefore they ascend from rivers and seas and gradually grow. These are caught at the river mouths of Naniwa for only about ten days. Chirimen-jako and chirimen-ko-ayu are dried and salted dorome.

This fish does not exist in Edo. The Honcho Shokkan states that "whitebait are large ice fish that live in rivers and seas, ascend to the sea in spring, spawn among water plants and sand and stones in the second and third months, and their offspring grow into ice fish, then ascend to rivers and seas and grow further into whitebait," but this is an unreliable theory.

○ Whitebait from Bizen Hirae, Sesshu Kuwana and other places are caught with standing nets or mae-gaki. Kuwana's standing nets are seven jo high and hang down about three jo, with net mesh of about one bu. The aba are tubs and the iwa are lead weights. Five boats with seven men each set the nets from offshore, moor the five boats together, and row toward the shore. The nets are about one hundred hiro long, and one net catches about two koku. Since there are so many fish, they are sold by measuring with masu (measures). Mezashi, made by stringing many fish on bamboo, are products of this region. The netting locations include Akasuga, Hama-jizo, Kametsu, Fukusaki, Toyota, and Isshiki. This spans three ri of sea route, and in the middle at a place called Yokomakura is the boundary between Bishu and Sesshu. On the Bishu side there are no whitebait, and in Kuwana there are no oysters. Even if occasionally caught, the taste is never good. People consider this one marvel. Upon reflection, this is the tidal boundary mentioned earlier. Originally the Ise Sea is an inlet, and Kuwana and Fukushima are river mouths. Above is the Kiso River whose downstream waters flow here. The principle is the same as for those produced in Nishinomiya.

○ One type called sardine fry is known as gamo-sho (isasa), and there is also the same fish that spawns in tidal waters, called by one name Sanohori, caught in winter months. In Wakashu there is also a similar fish called Amasaki, from mid-winter to early spring. Also in Chikuzen there is something called Shiro-uwo that is small, about one sun long, with seven small black spots under the belly, regardless of size [continues...]

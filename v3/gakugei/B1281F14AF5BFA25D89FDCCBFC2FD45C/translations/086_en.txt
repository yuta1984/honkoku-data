They catch [flounder] about thirty ri offshore from the coast. That place is called the flounder grounds, where fishermen from Wakasa, Echizen, Tsuruga, and Sangoku use hand-trawl nets. The sea depth is generally about fifty fathoms, and flounder live at the bottom and rarely float to the surface. Fishermen take boats of about thirty koku capacity with twelve or thirteen people, divided on the left and right sides of the boat, setting the sail sideways and borrowing its power to pull the nets. The floats (aba) float on the water surface, and the weights (iwa) sink to the bottom to spread the net. There are no other particulars. Among the things caught mixed in the nets, there are many crabs, which are very large.

○Salt preservation and air drying: What is called "steamed flounder" is salt-steamed. It has not been touched by fire. First, the fresh catch is soaked in salt water overnight to half-cook it, then placed on sand, covered with straw mats, and steamed with warm, humid air. After that, two pieces at a time are tied by the tail with string, dried a little, and avoiding even one night's lodging, are shipped to Kyoto the same day. During that season, it becomes daily or every-other-day round trips. Though there are many varieties of salted and dried fish, this should be called a national treasure, a delicacy for the nobility.

○Same: Small sea bream

This is caught using longlines. It is also called "se-nawa." The rope is about one handful thick and about one ri long. To this, fishing lines about one shaku long with hooks attached are arranged on the rope at intervals of one fathom, with barrel floats tied to both ends. After a while, using those floats as markers, when pulled up, one hundred lines yield one hundred fish with not a single one empty. The bait consists of horse mackerel, mackerel, shrimp, etc. When similarly salt-dried, the taste also surpasses that of flounder. ○This method is also used to catch cod. Locally it is called "makoto kodai" (true small sea bream).

○Sea bream nets of other provinces
What the Kinai region considers fine products are Akashi sea bream and Awaji sea bream. However, catching in Sanshū Emata is very abundant. All of these use hand-trawl nets. In places where there are many rocks in the sea, they use something called "buri" to chase [fish] and gather them in suitable locations. Buri are thin boards with strings attached, arranged in great numbers on long ropes, and when pulled around like placing nets, the buri rotate in the water and scatter like fallen leaves, so the fish are startled by this and fearfully drift in the mid-current, gathering in the center of the buri.

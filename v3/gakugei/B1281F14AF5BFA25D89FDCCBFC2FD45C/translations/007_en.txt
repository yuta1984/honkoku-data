Song of Sake Celebration

【Left Page】
The person who brewed this sacred sake—did they
set up that drum at the mortar
and brew while singing?
Did they brew while dancing?
This sacred sake, this sacred sake—how
utterly delightful it is! (sasa)

This is from when Emperor Ōjin was
returning from Tsunoga,
Empress Jingū brewed sake
and waited to serve it, offering celebration
and having songs sung.
Takeuchi no Sukune answered
on behalf of the Emperor—
this is that song. This is called the song of sake celebration,
and in later generations it is sung even when
pounding rice for the Daijōsai ceremony.

When whale oil is dropped onto the water surface, it removes dust and makes the water transparent, allowing one to see the bottom as if looking into a mirror. Then they scoop them up with a dip net.

○The method of drying: Remove the three strips of intestines from the belly, put several hundred in an empty pot and boil over strong fire for one day. Then salty juice naturally comes out, and they become charred black, dried, hard, and small in form. Boil this again for one night until they become somewhat larger again, then take them out and wait for them to cool. String them with thread to dry, or stick them on bamboo to dry - this is called kushiko (skewered sea cucumber). Large ones are tied with wisteria vines and hung. This is how they are produced in Kanto and Echigo regions. The products from Shodoshima are large and taste good. Those from Satsuma, Chikushū, Buzen, and Bungo are extremely small.

○In the Wamyōshō, the thing called old sea cucumber (hoya) is said to be what is processed into dried sea cucumber. Also, fresh sea cucumber is commonly called tiger sea cucumber (torako) and has spotted patterns, and there are said to be other varieties as well.

Those mixed with black are inferior quality. If you frequently stir the three-colored mixture in the shade, it all turns yellow. Or if you add one egg yolk to one cup of intestines and stir, the taste becomes most delicious. In ancient times, these intestines were even used as tribute, but only from Noto, Owari, and Mikawa - not from other provinces. This is because completely yellow ones are rare. {{Small text: There is also one type that has reddish-yellow colored material like seaweed in the intestines, called konoko, but it doesn't taste good}}

○Sea urchin (uni) {{Small text: Also called reirōshi}}
This is considered the finest among salted foods. Though found on various islands, those from Echizen and Satsuma are considered premium products. The shell

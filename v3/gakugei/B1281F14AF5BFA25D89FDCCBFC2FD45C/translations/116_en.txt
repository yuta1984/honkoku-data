○ Grilled Clams (yaki-hamaguri) and Drizzle Clams (shigure-hamaguri)
These are specialties of Kuwana and Tomita in Sesshu. Pine needles are burned and the clams are grilled from the hinge side, leaving no muscle attached to the shell, and the taste is excellent.

○ The preparation of drizzle clams involves combining the floating liquid that accumulates in tubs where tama-miso has been pickled with the broth from boiled clams, adding Japanese pepper, wood ear mushrooms, ginger, etc., and simmering the shelled meat until concentrated. Even on long journeys to distant provinces, they never spoil.

○ The preparation of tama-miso involves boiling soybeans well, wrapping them in straw, hanging them above the stove for about a month, then pounding them in a mortar, mixing with salt and adding water. The clear liquid that rises and accumulates on top is used instead of soy sauce, and the bottom portion becomes miso. [Side note: When fish are cooked with this, even slightly spoiled fish is restored and tastes good | Even today it is used as a daily necessity at post stations]

○ Gori (a type of goby) [Side note: Not found in character dictionaries, temporarily following popular usage | Also called Ishifushi]
This is a specialty of the Kamo River in Yamashiro. According to the Yamato Honzo, there are two types. One type has

round fins under the belly, with flat parts on those fins that attach to stones. This is considered the genuine type. It is rich in fat, tastes good as soup, resembles the tofugyo but is small, with black and white patterns on the back. Also called ishifushi, etc. This is a rough explanation by Kaibara-shi. Although they are indeed the same fish, there are small differences in form. One should refer to the diagram below.

○ The fishing method involves joining two mats, laying them in shallow water, placing many small stones on them, with two people holding up both ends of one side, while another person uses a wooden mallet over three shaku long from downstream to scrape the river bottom and drive the fish up. The fish, when chased, attach to and hide among the small stones on the mats, and are caught by lifting them up together with the stones. This is called gori-oshi (gori pushing).

○ Those from the Asano River in Kaga are also considered a specialty. The method of catching them is the same as the Kamo River method, differing only in name - called "Futai" (woven basket) and "Ita-oshiki" (board pusher). The Futai is made of split bamboo like a large winnowing basket, used instead of the Kamo River mats. The Ita-oshiki is a thick board about five shaku long and three shaku wide clamped with bamboo, with footholds underneath. One puts their feet in these holes, holds the excess bamboo above with their hands, and scrapes between the stones to drive the fish forward.

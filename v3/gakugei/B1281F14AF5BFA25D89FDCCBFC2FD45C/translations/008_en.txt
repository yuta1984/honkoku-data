○Sake Brewing
Sake must surely be a sacred creation. Its origins are discussed in Dou Ge's "Wine Manual" from the Song dynasty, but they are not clear. In Japan, the ancient reading of sake is "ki," which means food offering (ke). Ke means "spirit" or "vital energy." 《Marginal note: There are examples of using Chinese pronunciation as Japanese readings, such as calling "utsuwa" (vessel) "ke"》When offered to gods and presented to rulers, it is respectfully called "miki" (sacred sake). Also, "kuroki" (black sake) and "shiroki" (white sake) refer to clear sake and cloudy sake respectively. ○The meaning of the reading "sake" is an abbreviation of "te-sake," where "sa" is an auxiliary character and "ke" is a variant pronunciation of "ki." It is also known by another name, "miwa." This is because making sake is called "kamisu" (to brew), so "ka" was abbreviated and prefixed with the character for "taste" (mi). Ancient poems contain the pillow words "umasake no Miwa" and "Mimuro," as stated in the Kanji-kō. However, these are only used in phrases like "umasake no Miwa," "umasake no Mimuro," and "umasake no Kaminabi-yama," with no other examples of usage. Both Kaminabi and Mimuro are alternative names for Mount Miwa, nothing else. Based on this, I believe that using the Man'yōshū verse "umasake Kaminabi" as the source poem, both Miwa and Mimuro, being mountains where gods reside, were composed with the meaning of "god" in mind. 《Marginal note: This is like examples where "chihayafuru kami" (mighty gods) becomes "chihayafuru kamo" or "chihayafuru uchi"》Therefore, it is not without reason that the gods of Miwa and Matsuo are considered the ancestral deities of sake. Also, in the eighth year of Emperor Sujin according to the Nihon Shoki, Ikuhi from Takahashi village was made the sake keeper (sakahito) of the great god, and in the same year's twelfth month, the Emperor had Ōtataneko worship the god Yamato-Ōkunitama. The Ōkunitama is called Ōmononushi and is the god of Miwa. Therefore, it appears that here the sake keeper was established and worship of the god began. 《Marginal note: That sake brewers today use cedar branches as shop signs instead of curtains is probably due to this connection》Later, during the reign of Emperor Ōsazaki (Nintoku), Esohori and Otosohori, who came from Korea, were said to have talent for making sake. They were given the name Maro and called Sakamiiratsko, and Yamakahime was given the title Sakamiiratsume. The surnames Sakami and Sakabe began from this time. From this point, the methods of sake brewing became refined, and now nothing in the world equals Japanese sake. This is because this is a country where grain essence is of the highest quality. Among these, those brewed in Itami in Settsu Province are considered the most pure and robust, and are widely transported by ship and cart, even responding to imperial commands. Therefore, they are permitted to use the official seal. Even today, in distant provinces, refined sake is referred to simply as "Itami."

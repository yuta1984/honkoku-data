Particularly, there are blue spots under the cheeks, and after death, blood flows from the eyes. There are needle-like spines on the back, and no scales.
It is blue-black in color with a white belly like mica. The tail is forked and hard, with the upper part large and the lower part small. Large ones measure one to two jō, small ones seven to eight shaku. The meat is fat and thick, and this fish has strength in its head. When the head faces land and the tail faces the sea, it is easy to catch by hooking. This is because there is no strength in the tail.
They rise riding warm currents, and when they come feeling dizzy from seeing the sun, they form schools. Fishermen catch them to extract oil, or make dried meat.

○Using the character 鮪 for "shibi" does not conform to the interpretation in materia medica or dictionaries, but the Wamyōshō, based on Min books, sometimes gives different names for fish of different sizes, which is not without reason. Also, in the Nihon Shoki, Buretsu Chronicle, the son of Minister Matori is named 鮪 (Shibi), with a self-annotation also reading it as "jimi." Originally, China's explanation of marine life has been quite crude, as already mentioned. Therefore, we may temporarily follow 鮪 (Shibi) as acceptable. The etymological meaning of Shibi is unclear.

In Sanshū, they are caught with drift nets. They are abundant from May onwards until before October. Large ones reach six to seven shaku in length. When fishermen see fish gathering, they line up dozens of boats and row around from behind the fish, chasing them intensely until the fish gradually tire and become unsteady as if drunk. At that time, stones are thrown from boats that have advanced ahead to further frighten them, and when the moment is determined for them to turn back and try to escape, nets are lowered without letting a single fish escape. This is called ō-ami or shiboru. Then they haul in the nets and scoop them up with dip nets.

○The character 鰆 is also a domestic creation. Although dictionaries list it as "spring fish," it refers to a tiny fish of only two to three bu and should not be applied at all. The Yamato Honzō applies it to the horse mackerel. It says: though the fish is large, its belly is small and narrow. Hence it is called sawara (narrow belly). "Sa" means narrow and small. The Min book says: blue-spotted color, no scales, has teeth; the small ones are called seisetsu (sagoshi), etc. ○The roe is very large. When dried, it is called karasumi, meaning "dried roe." However, the dried roe of mullet surpasses this.

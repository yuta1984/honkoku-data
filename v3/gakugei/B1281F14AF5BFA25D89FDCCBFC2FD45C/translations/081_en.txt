In later generations, people came to dislike the habit of enjoying this delicious taste, and eventually it was considered old-fashioned and fell to being a cheap fish, no longer added to banquet cuisine. However, even now for common people, it is still treasured as one of the eight delicacies. 《Small specimens of this fish are dried and made into imitations of dried bonito flakes》

From the Man'yōshū:
"Like the fishing fires lit by fishermen catching tuna, my hidden feelings should come to light"

○In the Monthly Ordinances of the Book of Rites, it states "In late spring, the emperor offers tuna to the ancestral temple," but there is debate about the character for tuna, making it difficult to determine if this refers to modern bluefin tuna. This will be discussed further below.

○The net has a mesh of about eight sun, and is made with fine rope of about twenty chō in length. It has a bottom and its shape is like a winnowing basket. There is a bag at the tail end. The rope is thicker than a thumb and is constantly kept submerged on the ocean floor. Two boats each are attached to both ends of the net to wait for schools of fish to gather. If the gathering is slow, they will guard the net uselessly for two to three months. There is also a fish-spotting tower on the mountaintop from which they watch, determining whether the fish school numbers in the tens of thousands, and wave flags while calling out "kamairō kamairō." 《"Kamairō" is a transformation of "kamae yo" (get ready)》 At that time, three small boats called "Danbei" go out. With three people per boat wearing waist straw coats, sashes, and headbands, they row over as if flying. When they grab the bottom of the net and pull until more than half is done, flags are waved again from the mountaintop, and many Danbei boats rush over to pull up together. When the net approaches close to the boats, the fish surge upward like they are boiling. The fishermen strike the fish heads with rake-like or hook-like implements, causing them to struggle even more and naturally leap into the boats. Once they have all entered, the net is again submerged as before, and only the boats row away. The bag attached to the tail is filled with sardines equivalent to about two boats' worth, but they pay no attention to other fish. This is because the net has been submerged for a long time and become mossy, which the sardines treat as their nest. This should be viewed in reference to the illustration.

○There is also another method of catching them by fishing. This is a technique from Wakasa Province, where the hook is about three sun long, the hemp rope is one hundred ken long, and about one ken from the hook mouth is also wrapped with hemp. This is called "mouse tail." Bonito intestines are used as bait. The line is coiled in a bucket and not attached to a rod.

○This fish has a large head with a pointed beak, a long nose, a mouth under the jaw, and cheeks and gills like an iron helmet

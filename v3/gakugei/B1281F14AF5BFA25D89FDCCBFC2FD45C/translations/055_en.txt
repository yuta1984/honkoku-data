Regarding the footprints, when considering whether they will come that night or not, and estimating what time they should come tomorrow, there is never a case where the prediction misses the mark.

○Although the high rope method is also used for catching geese, geese are more intelligent than ducks and can naturally see at night, so they do not descend where there is much feed, nor do they come down to disturbed sandy ground. When a pair of birds circles the area and flies away with a single cry, the flock follows them. Even if they happen to descend near the high ropes, when hunters suddenly chase them with bamboo poles, they become startled and get caught in the ropes only once in ten attempts.

○There is also another method called "musō-gaeshi" (peerless return net). This is a method for catching ducks used in Torikai, Shimamoto District, Settsu Province. In the past, the high rope method was often used, but in recent years they learned from hunters in Owari Province to use return nets. This is a convenient technique. Generally, a net about six ken long and two ken wide has a rope of about twenty ken attached. Short stakes are driven into two places in the tidal flats or sandy ground, the hem of the net is tied and secured, bamboo poles are attached to the upper edge, these bamboo poles are opened diagonally in both directions and tied to the originally driven stakes so they can return well. The net, bamboo, and ropes are all well hidden in the sand, and the area in front is dug slightly to create a depression where rice, millet, etc. are scattered to wait for the birds to flock, then from a distance

the net is pulled back by two people working together, covering the birds above so that not one escapes, capturing dozens of birds in one stroke. The wings are twisted in alternating directions and when released on embankments, they cannot fly. This is called "wing binding." This method is also used for catching geese, but there are specific ways to bury in sand and scatter bait, making it difficult for inexperienced people to catch them.

○Ducks live in mountain marshes, seashores, and lakes, and are not kept in human homes. In China, the green-head is considered the finest quality. In Japan, this is called "true duck." Therefore, in the Man'yōshū, it was composed with reference to its blue-green color. Also, the pintail ranks second to this and is called "small duck." Its ancient name is Takahe. There are black ducks, red-heads, wigeons, various species of pochards, grebes, various diving ducks, mergansers, long-tailed ducks, and many other species. Green-heads, small ducks, and spot-billed ducks taste good, but the others are not so good.

○Minoegoshi-gamo (The character for duck is "ahiro." Therefore, it's also called "water duck." The correct character for "kamo" is "fu." Here we follow common usage.)

This is a hunting method used in the mountains of Iyo Province. In the mornings and evenings of August and September, when flocks of ducks cross over the peaks, the grass is worn down by their wings and doesn't grow tall. Hunters hide in holes dug about three shaku deep in the shade of this grass, making nets in the shape of fans, with the pivot point at

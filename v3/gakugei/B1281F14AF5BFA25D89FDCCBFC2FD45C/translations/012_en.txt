Wrap it in several layers of straw mats and place it on shelves in the fermentation room for about ten days. When mold grows, pile it up in the center of the koji tray, then spread it evenly across the entire tray about twice to complete the process.

【Sake starter】Five to of rice is called one brewing batch. "One finishing" means processing one batch per day. Multiples depend on the brewery's financial capacity.

Three days before the set date, take out the rice. The next morning, wash and soak it. The following morning, steam it into rice, place it on straw mats to cool well, and divide it into eight half-kiri containers (six containers for winter sake). Add one to and seven sho of koji and four to and eight sho of water to five to of rice (each household has its own method of adjustment). After about half a day when the water is absorbed, stir it by hand. This is called "temoto." At night, crush it with a paddle. This is called "yamaoroshi." From then on, stir it once every hour day and night (this is called "work"). After three days, collect and store everything in two-koku capacity tubs. After three days, foam rises up. This is called either "agari" or "fukikiri" (there is a skilled art in watching for this moment, and this is considered crucial). Divide this again into two half-kiri containers from the moto-oroshi, making three containers total with the two-koku tub. After about two hours, wrap in straw mats, and in about six hours natural heat will develop inside (for winter sake, put hot water in warming tubs and insert into the moromi).

Stir and cool with paddles for two to three days, again stirring every hour. Everything up to this point is called "moto."

【Soe】This refers to adding rice koji and water on top of the above moto. This is also called "kake-rice" or "aji."

Collect all of the above moto into three-shaku tubs. On top, add steamed rice of eight to, six sho, five go of white rice, koji made from two to, six sho, five go of white rice, plus seven to and two sho of water. This is called "hitomoto." Similarly, stir every hour day and night, and the third day is called "naka." At this time, divide this into two three-shaku tubs and add steamed rice from one koku, seven to, two sho, five go of white rice, koji from five to, two sho, five go of white rice, plus one koku, two to, eight sho of water. Stir every hour, and the next day divide this in half to make two tubs. This is called "oowake." Similarly, stir every hour, and the next day add steamed rice from three koku, four to, four sho of white rice, koji from one koku, six to of white rice, plus one koku, nine to, two sho of water (this equals twenty-five cups in eight-sho capacity tubs called "bonburi"). This is called "shimai." In total, this becomes eight koku, five to of rice and koji combined, and four koku, four to of water. After two to four more days, wait for heat to develop, then watch for the right time to begin stirring again. There is a crucial moment for this, so it is considered very important. Continue stirring every hour and gradually cool. When cooling is complete and stirring becomes twice daily, this marks the maturation of the sake. This is done in three-shaku tubs.

When it boils, they fill another vessel with cold water, place a bamboo strainer on top of it, and transfer the boiled mixture. The dregs remain in the strainer while the wax floats on the water surface of the vessel below. When this is put into a ceramic container and double-boiled, it naturally solidifies into wax. Also, when extracting refined honey, if boiled in a pot, the honey floats on top, the wax remains in the middle, and the sediment settles at the bottom. Even when this is collected and cooled, it naturally forms into yellow wax.

○Aizu Wax
In pharmacological texts this is called insect white wax, which is wax harvested in Aizu, Ōshū. This is made by raising insects called Ibokurai and releasing them onto trees called mizuradoki (privet trees), whereupon they naturally produce wax between the branches that is extremely white in color. These insects exist only in Ōshū and nowhere else, so their exact form is not well known. What is now called white wax in other provinces is the bleached white color of wax from lacquer trees and such. Also, what pharmacies call white wax for external medical use is bleached beeswax, which is also not the genuine article. The trees called mizuradoki are abundant in many places.

The leaves resemble those of honeysuckle but are smaller. In summer, small white flowers bloom especially at the branch tips, and after flowering, fruit develops. When ripe, the color is black like mouse droppings. In winter the leaves fall. Also, if this wax is applied to swords, they will not rust for a long time. If applied to warts, they naturally fall off, hence the name "wart remover." The authenticity of what wax shops now sell as "Aizu wax" is questionable.

○Giant Salamander
Lives in mountain stream water. Resembles a bullhead but with a large mouth. Tea-brown in color with spotted patterns on the back. Can readily leave water and travel on land. Large ones are about three shaku in length. Has a strong sanshō (Japanese pepper) scent. Also climbs pepper trees to harvest and eat the bark. When this fish is kept, it cries at night like a small child's voice. Being extremely hardy by nature, it is usually kept in small pools. When needed, half its body is cut off, and the remaining half is put back in the small pool, whereupon it naturally regenerates flesh and returns to its original whole body. Therefore, in the Sakushū dialect it is called "Hansaki" (half-cut). Also, its shed skin for a long time...

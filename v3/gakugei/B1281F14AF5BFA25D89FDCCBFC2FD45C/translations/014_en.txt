Made into four parts, after about eight or nine days have passed, they are lifted with lifting tubs, put into bags, and filled into pressing vessels. The amount from over 300 to 500 is considered appropriate. Numerous stones are hung on the male pillar and gradually pressed, and what comes out is clear sake. This is put into large tubs called "seven-inch clarifying tubs," and after four or five days, it is called "ara-ori" (rough lees) or "ara-bashiri" (first run). When this is packed into four-to barrels for shipping, seven to five sho makes one pack load of two barrels, totaling about eleven or twelve pack loads.

The above method represents only one household's method in Itami township. Others have household secrets, with stone amounts and quantities each having major similarities and minor differences. Most notably, over a hundred years ago, brewing was done with about eight koku to eight koku four or five to, forty to fifty years ago eight koku eight to of polished rice was considered supreme quality. Now what is called supreme quality reaches over nine koku to ten koku. The current changes are also impossible to fully describe. Adding clarifying ash is done for low-grade rice wine, thin wine, or spoiled wine, never used for premium sake. For interval sake, the rice addition method was formerly three to extra like new sake, but from some time, the good method became five sho extra for the base, one to extra for the middle taste, and one to five sho extra for the final addition. Both pre-cold and cold sake should follow this. Interval sake takes over forty days from base addition, pre-cold

takes over seventy days, and cold sake takes eighty to ninety days before the sake is ready. Most importantly, considerations of increasing, decreasing, and timing adjustments according to the year's cold and warmth are essential. However, in the past, before new sake there was a production called "botai" which was also called new sake. Even now, mountain households only use this production method. Even in Osaka and elsewhere, in the past premium sake was not a drink for common people, and those who occasionally enjoyed it brewed this botai sake in their homes. Now, after two hundred years of peaceful rule, even those who barely live day to day can drink their fill and clap their hands in humble alleys singing "banzai." We must not forget to appreciate the blessing of living in such times.

Rice
Base rice uses local aged rice from Kaga, Himeji, Awaji, etc. For supplementary rice, northern aged rice is first-rate, with Akita and Kaga considered best. For bases from pre-cold period onward, new grain from Takatsuki,納米, Yodo, and mountain areas is used.

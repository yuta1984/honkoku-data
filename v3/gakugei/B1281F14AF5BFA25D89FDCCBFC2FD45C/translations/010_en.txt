Therefore, Itami can be said to be the beginning of Japan's finest sake. This too has not been a long-standing tradition from ancient times.

Originally starting from the Bunroku and Keicho periods, the person who began selling to Edo was from the Yamanaka family of Konoike village, neighboring Itami. When it began, they brewed only five to or one koku and carried it to sell, or when it reached twenty or thirty koku, since there was surplus even in nearby provinces, they loaded it on horses and traveled all the way to Edo to sell it. Unexpectedly gaining large profits, they loaded the proceeds back on horses and returned home. As Edo became increasingly prosperous, the volume became limitless, and they amassed enormous wealth. Those who followed included Inadera-ya and Masu-ya, who resided in Itami. For shipping and transportation, Manganji-ya of Ikeda was the pioneer. Subsequently, many sake brewers emerged, and now the products made in Itami, Ikeda, and other places in the same province such as Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Nada, and Imazu are also excellent. Although there are many other places in other provinces that have gained fame, each has its own characteristics of local water and soil, and family brewing methods, making them as varied as a hundred flavors or human faces, which cannot be fully described.

The practice of pressing sake to make clear sake (seishu) began only about 130 years ago; before that, it was merely strained through bamboo baskets.

The sake brewed in the present day includes: new sake (shinShu - brewing begins around the autumn equinox), interval sake (aishu - made between cold-season sake), pre-cold sake (kanmae-zake), and cold sake (kanshu - all requiring more days and becoming progressively more expensive). Among these, new sake is particularly famous from Itami, with an increasingly wonderful aroma. This begins around the autumn equinox in the eighth month, when an auspicious day is selected, and rice washing for koji begins four days prior (though in recent years it begins around the Cold Dew period in the ninth month).

Sake mother (formerly made with barley, hence written with the character for koji. Chinese methods are extremely difficult, but Japanese methods are convenient)

Around the equinox, on the morning four days before the set date, rice is washed and soaked in water for one day. The next day it is steamed into cooked rice, placed on mats, mixed and leveled with ladles, and when it reaches body temperature, it is all transferred to vats (vats are boxes for holding rice). Covered with mats and placed in an earth cellar for about half a day. Around noon the lumps are broken up, and at that time malt is added - about two go per koku. That night around eight o'clock it is removed from the vats, piled in the center of koji lids, stacked ten at a time. The next day it is turned once, and waiting until evening, it is spread evenly to fill the lids, then the lids are stacked corner-wise. By seven o'clock that night it becomes yellow and white koji.

Koji malt: Ancient rice must be used. After steaming into cooked rice, about two go of zelkova ash per sho is mixed...

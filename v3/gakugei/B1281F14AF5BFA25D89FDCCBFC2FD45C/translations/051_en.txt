This technique appears to have been transmitted from Korean methods. ○Those who capture and raise hawks all catch them in their nests and tame them. Among these, in Oyamada in Iyo Province, they use nets to catch them. This mountain is a great mountain spanning three provinces: Tosa and Awa. Since hawks migrate targeting high mountains, they inevitably come to this mountain.
Generally, the migration period is during the seventh and eighth months, when yuzu fruit begins to color.
○The nets are called stretched nets (harikiriami), with mesh openings of one or two inches, made of silk thread or hemp. They stretch nets about three to four feet vertically and two ken horizontally, and below them place what is called a lantern net - a cotton thread net about three feet long with a circumference of about one foot - containing a bulbul, tied to a stake. Beside this, they place a wooden snake replica in a bamboo tube with a long string attached, set up from midnight. In early morning, when they spot a hawk emerging from treetops to forage, they pull the snake's string from within an enclosure, directing it toward the bulbul. When it becomes frightened and agitated, the hawk, seeing this, swoops down to catch it and gets caught in the net. Bamboo hooks on both sides are lacquered to slide smoothly; when the hawk touches them, they naturally contract and entangle the hawk for capture. There are specific locations for setting these nets, and this is not an easy task either. The hunters all wear their hair in topknots, making it difficult to distinguish between men and women. Even in winter, they wear layers of hemp clothing. ○Most hawks caught here are

sparrowhawks (haitaka), also called hashitaka, which are female young sparrowhawks. Excellent ones catch ducks and herons, resembling goshawks but smaller. Their markings come in various patterns. ○After capture, mountain leg cords and mountain main cords are attached, all made from hemp. The parts touching the feet use soft leather, and the swivels are made from bamboo tubes or deer antler. Small hawks have their tail feathers reinforced with paper and are placed in basket cages to sell in villages. ○Large hawks from other provinces and Oshu are called nest hawks, captured from nests. The method is not well known. ○Food is placed in feeding boards and inserted for feeding. ○For large hawks, tail bags and wing bags are sewn at one point to the tail feather shafts with soft cloth. The dimensions follow the size of the tail feathers.
○Different names according to capture time
Red-hair (also called net-caught, first-type, yellow hawk - refers to summer young caught in autumn), nest hawk (caught from nest), nest-rounder (caught in May-June after fledging), field-weathered hawk (also called mountain-weathered, wood-weathered, caught in October-November), village-fallen hawk (caught in December), new-jewel hawk (caught in January), Saho-princess-return (also called maiden hawk, small-mountain-return, caught in February-March), return (refers to those that have molted in mountains and fields; partial-return means molted once, complete-return means molted twice).
○Taming hawks
Newly captured birds are called "brought down." These are thoroughly washed with body-temperature water around the tail feathers, beak area, and food stains. The beak and claws are trimmed, leg cords attached, and night-perching is performed. Night-perching involves taking slightly human-accustomed "brought down" hawks, opening the night roost, and without using lights, carrying them by hand while wandering through mountains and fields throughout the night.

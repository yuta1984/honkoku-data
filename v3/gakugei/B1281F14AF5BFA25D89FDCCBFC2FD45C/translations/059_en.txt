A long bamboo pole is attached to prevent and catch [ducks] flying near the hole above. This also catches birds when the net contracts and entangles them. It is most difficult to capture easily without skilled practitioners. {However, peaks with rice fields on both sides are considered good. Dark nights, both morning and evening, are especially preferred. When the net is cast, it is called "saka-ami" (slope net).}

Catching Bears {Another name for bear is "shiro"}
Bears always live in tree hollows and sleep well, so round logs are bound like a lattice with wisteria vines to block the entrance to the hollow. When many cut tree branches are put into the hollow, the bear pulls these branches inside and fills the hollow, finally emerging at the entrance. They wait for this moment and kill it by cutting or thrusting with bamboo spears in Mino Province, spears in Inaba, guns in Higo, and in northern provinces with "nataki" - a weapon like a naginata. In all cases, the vital point is just above the moon-shaped mark [on the bear's chest]. Also, in the mountains of Iwami Province, they live in old charcoal-burning holes. When catching these, if shot immediately with spears or guns, the gall bladder becomes very small, so they torment it thoroughly, enrage it, then kill it. ○Another method uses a drop trap. This is called "tenjō-tsuri" (ceiling suspension) in Yō Province {also called "oso"}.

In Awa Province it is called "osu" {Osu is an archaic term meaning oshi}. Its appearance can be understood from the diagram. Under something like a bamboo raft over two ken long, smoked deer meat is used as bait. Also, oak nuts and shashaki nuts are scattered. About twenty loads of large stones are placed on top {in Awa Province, they say seventy-five loads are used}. When it falls, the sound is like thunder. After falling, the mechanism continues to move from below for about three days. When this stops, the stones are removed and the mechanism is raised. The bear dies standing with its feet trampled about one shaku into the ground - this is always the case. ○There is also a method using pitfall traps, though it resembles the mechanism system.

Among these, in Hida, Kaga, and Koshi provinces, they can be caught by chasing with large spears. When the bear flees vigorously, if one shouts "Return!" the bear turns back toward the person. At this moment, when it shows fear at another shout of "Moon ring!" they immediately thrust in and pin it down. This requires the hunter's courage and skilled quick technique, otherwise it often becomes dangerous instead.

○Another method used in Sunshū Fuchū involves two people holding large raised axes waiting on both sides of the bear's den, while one or two other people probe inside the den with tree branches. When the bear grasps and pulls to draw the tree into the den, it lies sideways...

For ten koku of shochu, nine koku and two to of glutinous white rice and two koku and eight to of rice koji are brewed in one vat.
The next day, a paddle is added for stirring, and on the fourth and fifth days, it is stirred about seven times. In spring, the period is about twenty-five days. In the old days, stirring was done on the seventh day. For hon-naoshi (secondary preparation), ten koku of shochu uses two to and eight sho of glutinous white rice and one koku and two to of rice koji, with a brewing method similar to mirin.

Vinegar Making
Two to of black rice is soaked in water overnight, and the steamed rice is transferred from the steamer to the brewing vat while still warm.
Six to of koji and one koku of water are added, covered with a lid, and the vat is wrapped with straw mats and straw to prevent air leakage. After seven days, the lid is opened for stirring, then covered again as before. Every seventh day, it is stirred seven to eight times, and after observing maturation for sixty to seventy days, it is pressed like sake. <<Vinegar requires little expense for food use. It is used extensively for rouge, kelp, dyeing, etc.>> This also varies greatly by region and family methods, with notable products from Ogawa in Yamato Province, Kokawa in Kii Province, Kitakaze in Hyogo, Funai in Bungo, Sagami Province, and Suruga Province.

Bag Washing: After the completion of new sake, bags are washed in the flow of the Ina River. Waiting for that time, poor people from nearby villages beg for this washing liquid. Its taste is like thin amazake (sweet rice drink). This too is unique. Haiku poet Onitsura wrote:
　　Poor women and the liquid from washing bags

Atago Festival: On July 24th, called Atago Fire, lights are lit on Itami Honmachi Street, and elaborate decorative displays are created, not inferior to the river purification at Tenma Tenjin Shrine. On this day, crowds gather from all directions to see the grand warehouse celebrations of sake breweries. On this theme, Soin wrote:
　　Drunk on lantern light, Itami's great lanterns

This day marks when sake breweries set a hundred-day employment period for hiring workers, and many impoverished people from Tamba and Tango provinces come to apply.

They cut out roads of ten to twenty chō. When quarry workers light torches, the inside of the caves is pitch black, making it impossible to distinguish between stone and earth. The quarry workers also have a complexion different from ordinary people. To explain why they dig in this way: originally this stone has a skin that is extremely hard. This is what is now called "nebu-gawa" and shipped out (though genuine nebu-gawa comes from Iyo Province). Arrows cannot be driven in to split it apart. It can only be peeled off layer by layer. The Teshima stone commonly distributed is the inner part of this stone. Therefore, they remove the skin and dig inward. Particularly at Ie-no-ura, there are seven quarry pits. However, since it's a place requiring crossing a mountain to return, most utensils are manufactured in the mountains and carried out. These include water bottles, water containers, braziers, single stoves and the like - nothing particularly large. Kawa village is a fishing village, but stones are also quarried from the south side because they are light. Stonemasons live clustered at the foot of the mountain. However, all the mountains of Sanuki Province consist entirely of this stone, and even the rock caves of Kobo Daishi at Iyadani and Zentsuji Temple were built from this stone.

○The stone grain appears like an accumulation of stone fragments that have solidified. It resembles pumice stone with coarse grain. Therefore, when made into water basins, water leaks through and cannot be retained. However, it does not deteriorate when exposed to fire. The stone from Utsunomiya in Shimotsuke Province resembles this stone but is somewhat more beautiful. Pumice stone is formed from sea foam and is found in Iyo, Satsuma, Kii, and Sagami provinces. Since this mountain is also an island mountain in the sea, it is suspected to be formed from solidified tide after the opening of the world. The name Shiwaku might also be a transformation of "salt foam." ○Shiwaku stone became a restricted mountain (off-limits), and what is now called by that name is mostly prized for attached shells. This is shore stone from that area, with grain like rice and hard quality, used for garden stones, water basins, and decorative stones, valued for how quickly moss grows on them. Shore stones are pierced by waves creating warps and hollows, with unusual shapes being treasured.

○Mikage Stone
This comes from the mountains and valleys of Muko and Muhara counties in Settsu Province. There are stonemasons in Mikage Village on the seashore at the foot of the mountain who craft this into utensils and ship them out, hence the name Mikage stone. The name Mikage-yama refers to a mountain in Kamo, Yamashiro Province where hollyhock is gathered, not a mountain name in this province. There is only a Mikage pine in the village, with an old poem by Mototoshi-kyō in the Shoku-Kokinshū. Originally this mountain was by the seashore, and in the past there was no need to transport by ox cart, but now the shoreline has gradually been filled in, moving away from the mountain. Since the stone from the mountain entrance has been exhausted, they now quarry deep inside and transport it by ox cart from Sumiyoshi village, twenty chō upstream, then onward to Mikage village. The stones from Arima Highway, Namase riverbed, and other places also come from these same inner mountains. This high-quality

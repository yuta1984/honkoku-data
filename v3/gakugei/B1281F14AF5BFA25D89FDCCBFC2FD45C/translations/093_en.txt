○Oysters (Alternative name: Stone Flower)

All oysters consumed in the Kinai region are products of Geishū Hiroshima and are considered the finest quality. Those produced in Banshū, Kishū, Senshū and other provinces are large and naturally occurring, but their taste is not good. They are also produced in Bushū, Sanshū, and Bishū. The oysters cultivated in Hiroshima and sold in Osaka are all three-year specimens, so their taste is beyond reproach. The cultivation sites are Kusatsu, Nihoura, Tanna, Eba, Hiuna, Ōfuko, and other five or six locations. Among the several boats that anchor at various beaches in Osaka with their cargo, seven or eight out of ten come from Kusatsu and Niho, indicating that their cultivation operation is extremely large-scale. They typically stay moored in Osaka from October to the end of the New Year annually, then return home.

○Cultivation: The cultivation sites extend one ri, or sometimes up to three ri offshore from the castle town. During low tide, bamboo fences called "hibi" are constructed on the tidal flats using large bamboo poles, extending about one ri in length. Each section is about one jō in height and one chō in length, defined as one "unit," and people cultivate as many units as their financial means allow. The fences are shaped like the character "へ" (he), with gaps of about three shaku left at various points to catch fish that gather there. Each time the tide comes in, small oysters and seaweed attach to the hibi and remain, so from February to October, these are periodically scraped off with Bitchū hoes.

Additionally, there are enclosures resembling fish ponds, about five to ten ken square and one jō high, also surrounded by bamboo fencing. Oysters are buried about one shaku deep in the sand within these enclosures and cultivated for three years until they mature. The seaweed is prized as Hiroshima nori, and various shellfish are also harvested, particularly asari clams.

○While all bivalves reproduce through viviparity (live birth) or oviparity (egg-laying), oysters alone are naturally occurring through spontaneous generation. Since they attach to rocks and cannot move, there is no mating between male and female. They are all considered male, hence the name "bokaki" (male oyster). "Rei" refers to the large, coarse shells. When they attach to rocks and cluster together in grape-like formations, they are called "reibō" (oyster clusters). When they first develop, they are merely like fist-sized stones, but they gradually grow in all directions, with some reaching one to two jō in length. Each cluster contains one piece of meat inside. The meat of large clusters resembles a horse's hoof, while smaller ones are about the size of a human finger. When the tide comes in, all the clusters open their mouths, and when small insects enter, they close and fill their bellies.

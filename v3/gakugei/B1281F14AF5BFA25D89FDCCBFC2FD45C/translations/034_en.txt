○Sacred Fungus (Reishi) 《Commonly called reishi. Also known as: kamyōsō, fushisō, fukusō. Japanese readings: nukatode-take, saki-kusa》

In the Honzō, this is called the five-colored sacred fungus, a divine medicine. Since the Four Sages of Mount Shang gathered and ate these fungi, they became the food of immortals. Besides the five colors, there is also purple reishi. The above are divided into six types of sacred fungi, among which purple reishi is most common. Growing above ground in sandy-rocky soil or under pine trees, once it appears in a place, it will grow in the same location for many years. Initially yellow, it becomes tinged with red over time, maturing to purple-brown. The stem is black with luster. The underside of the cap has no cuts and is smooth. In taste, the five colors provide five flavors. This is an auspicious plant that flowers three times a year, and is recorded in Japan's Engi-shiki under auspicious omens. The Zuimeirei states "when rulers are benevolent and compassionate, sacred grass grows" - this refers to these fungi. ○Their forms: some grow singly and separate, others grow in clusters. Some grow layered on a single stem like maitake mushrooms. Others have stems that produce branches with caps, and still others have no caps but only stems growing about three shaku long with branches resembling deer antlers. This is called deer-horn reishi, a rare variety that appeared in the mountains of Ise in recent years. In total, there are about six hundred varieties of sacred fungi. More rare varieties are detailed in the Honzō Kōmoku. ○In Tanba, these are given to celebrate departures. In Ise, they are called "ten-thousand-year mushrooms" and used to decorate New Year's hōrai displays. In Edo they are called nekojyakushi, and in Sendai they are called magoshakushi and used to scratch smallpox.

Monkey Seat (Bracket Fungus) - This is a type of sacred fungus. It grows on trees without a stem. Large ones can reach four to five shaku.

○Shiitake Mushroom 《Also known as: kōko, kōkin, shojin》

Those produced in Hyūga are considered top quality. Many are also produced around Kumano. Those growing on chinquapin trees are considered standard. However, naturally growing ones are few. Therefore, to cultivate them, chinquapin trees are cut and left to rot in the rain, rice-washing water is poured on them and covered with straw mats, and after some time they grow. Some are also made by cutting down evergreen oak trees. They are harvested and dried by roasting rather than sun-drying, so their fragrance remains complete. "Fresh-dried" refers to those dried while still growing on the tree, and their aroma and flavor are extremely fine. These are called kajin in Chinese. Those shaped like matsutake with stems attached at the center are considered genuine. Also in China there are thunder...

Those caught in the sea of Yosa in Tango are considered to be of superior quality. This is because in this sea area there is a place called Ine, where there are very many chinquapin trees, and their nuts fall into the sea and become fish food, making them delicious. To the north is Amanohashidate, to the south is Miyazu, and to the west is Kiseto - this is the inlet sea of Yosa. Fish constantly swim here, and when they grow and try to leave, fishermen watch for this timing and catch them with pursuit nets.

The pursuit nets have mesh of approximately 1.5 to 1.6 shaku and are made with rope, stretched across the mouth of the inlet. Furthermore, dozens of boats are lined up, and the boat sides are struck to drive the fish in. Rope nets with 8-sun mesh are lowered in double layers to prevent fish from escaping, and ramie nets with 3-4 sun mesh are lowered in triple layers. Then the first nets are pulled up from left and right with windlasses, the triple ramie nets are hand-hauled into bag shapes, and when brought close to the shore, the leaping and swarming fish are hooked with large gaffs and thrown up onto the sandy shore. All floats use barrels, and for weights, pottery is used for rope nets and iron for ramie nets, connected continuously like earthenware pipes.

First the entrails are removed and salt is applied, then they are soaked in large barrels of about 6 koku capacity, covered with salt-filled straw bags and pressed with stones. Another method is to fill the belly with salt and bury in the ground,

cover with mats to remove moisture, then take out and apply salt again, wrapping in straw mats for shipment. The market is in Miyazu, and from there they go out to meet the boats at the fishing grounds and load up to return.

Yellowtail nets in other provinces use generally the same methods. They are all offshore nets, with vertical nets made of fine material, 7 to 14-15 fathoms deep, depending on the depth of the sea. Net mesh is about 7 sun from winter to late first month, and 5-6 sun from the second and third months. Five people ride in one fishing boat - four operate the nets and one handles the oar. Floats are barrels and weights are like whetstones. Nets are deployed by being drawn around like fish weirs in lakes, preventing fish from retreating backwards. Thus telescopes are set up on mountains near the sea to watch for fish gathering. When they gather, there is light on the sea waves and the water appears raised by one level. When one fish leaps, it is judged that there must be a thousand, and flags are waved to signal the boats. This is called tsujimi, or muragimi, or also uomi (fish watching). Two boats wait on the sea and follow the advance, retreat, left and right movements of those flags, separating in two directions and rowing around while lowering nets.

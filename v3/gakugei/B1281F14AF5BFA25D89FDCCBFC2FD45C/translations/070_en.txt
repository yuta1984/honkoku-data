They board boats, release (divers), and collect (abalone) in wicker baskets. During this time, they hold their breath for a while. Although this is work they are accustomed to morning and evening, when they emerge and exhale, their voices echo far and wide, truly sorrowful to hear.

Additional Notes
○Regarding diving to the sea bottom to catch abalone, according to the Nihon Shoki (Chronicles of Japan), in the fourteenth year of Emperor Inkyo's reign, when the emperor hunted on Awaji Island, although there were very many beasts, he could not catch a single animal all day long. Because of this, he had divination performed, and immediately there was an oracle from the divine spirit saying, "There are pearls at the bottom of this Akashi sea. If you enshrine me with those pearls, I will let you catch all manner of beasts." Hearing this, he gathered ama (sea divers) from various places and had them search the sea bottom. Unable to reach there, at that time a sea diver from Nakamura in Awa Province named Osashi tied a rope around his waist and dove in. After a while he emerged and said, "There is a large abalone at the sea bottom, and it emits light from that place. Probably what the god requests is in that abalone's belly." By the people's decision, he dove in again and embraced that large abalone, floated to the surface, and suddenly died. As expected, he obtained pearls like peach

seeds from its belly. The people mourned Osashi's death, buried him and built a tomb, which still exists today. At this time the sea's depth was sixty fathoms, and since this was especially the work of male sea divers, one can imagine their hardship. Later generations imitated this and composed it into Noh drama as the "Jewel Diver of Hakozaki"—this must be based on this historical event.

《Annotation: ○Abalone is generally the chief among shellfish. Since ancient times it has been prized. Large ones measure over one shaku in diameter, small ones two or three sun. In water, they protrude halfway out of their shells and roll to walk》

○In the Kinai region's common usage, calling this "Ama-gai" (diver shellfish) is probably because it is something that ama (sea divers) take. "Awabi" probably means "awa-nu mi" (non-matching body) because it is a shell that attaches to one side and does not match. In Man'yōshū volume 11: "The Ise sea divers who dive morning and evening for abalone shells, having one-sided love," and in volume 7: "Taking abalone pearls at the sea divers' Shimazu in Ise's sea, will love continue to flourish afterward?" Also in volume 17 it is written as abalone pearls. ○Male shells are narrow and long. Female shells are round, short, and have much meat. However, those with nine or seven holes are extremely rare.

Those caught until May are called spring-fushi and made into high-quality dried bonito, while those until August are called autumn-fushi. Since live sardines are used as bait, sardine netting is also commonly done first.
Sardines are put into bait baskets of about two tsubo and soaked in seawater, then transferred into barrels of about three koku capacity filled with seawater, loaded onto fishing boats of fourteen to fifteen koku capacity. One person uses a long-handled ladle to scoop out the seawater while another person continuously adds fresh seawater from the side, constantly replacing it to keep the fish alive. There are twelve fishermen per boat.
The rod is one and a half ken long, the line about one ken long, both thicker than ordinary ones. The hook tip has no barb. The boat has wave screens made of bamboo mats and straw mats. To begin fishing, first many live sardines are released on the water surface, and bonito attach to these and jump and gather. A sardine is threaded onto a hook from its tail and thrown into the school, whereupon they immediately bite and are pulled up continuously without pause, catching dozens of fish at once like shooting arrows in rapid succession. ○Another method: when fish naturally gather in shallow water, whale teeth or calf horns are hollowed out, a hook is passed through, and fish can be caught even without bait.

This is called "kakeru" (hooking). ○When wanting to gather fish, similarly cow horn with chicken feathers attached is waved and moved on the water surface, creating a brilliant light that resembles a large school of sardines. There are other methods such as balance fishing, but these are all recreational activities of villagers, not the work of professional fishermen.
○When going out fishing, if one encounters bonito schools chasing bait from afar, they naturally leap into the boat with such force that human strength can hardly prevent it. When extremely numerous, they nearly sink the boat, so one observes from a distance and quickly rows away, waiting for them to pass.
○Cooking, steaming and drying to make bonito flakes: The fishing boat approaches the shore and the fish are thrown up onto the sand. Men and women, old and young from the fishing village all gather, each bringing a tub or a board and a kitchen knife. They place a board across the tub as a cutting board, first cut off the fish head, remove the belly, take out the bones, fillet it into two pieces, then cut those again to make four pieces from one fish. The bones and entrails are dropped into the tub and become the share for each hired worker.

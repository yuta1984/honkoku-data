It is said that even after death, they still move. There is another species called the Hakone salamander, which is a small fish. In Echigo, it is called "Senkuhanuo." Its form resembles a newt (imori) and its belly is also red, so it is also called "Akahara" (red belly). It is shipped as dried goods and treats intestinal worms in children. What the "Butsurishōshiki" refers to as the black fish from the source of Minkō is this creature. The ones that come from the areas around Karuizawa and Wada in Sagami and Shinano provinces are also newt-like creatures that crawl up the rocks on both sides of waterfalls at night. Local people catch them using cotton bags fashioned like dip nets with bottoms that close like drawstring purses. They shine torches, watch for the fish climbing up, insert the bag so the fish naturally enters, then untie the bottom of the bag and put them in jars. They are also shipped from Tanba, Tajima, and Tosa provinces. The "Honzō" mentions a species called teigyō (䱱魚), which is also called salamander, but this is a mermaid. It lives in rivers and lakes. Its form resembles a catfish with long wing-like appendages that look like hands and feet. Also, what is recorded in Shizhen's "Keishinroku" is the sea mermaid of Huakao. Dutch people brought bones of this sea mermaid, calling it by the foreign name "Heishimuruto," but there are very many fakes.

○Kudzu - Kudzu grain (also called: deer bean)
It is a vine plant. The root is eaten and is called kudzu root. When made into powder, it is called kudzu powder. That which comes from Yoshino is considered top quality. Now, the one from Kishū called Rokurō Dayū is praised as having the finest flavor. This is probably because it contains absolutely no other substances. The plant grows naturally and abundantly in both mountains and fields. In China, they plant it in home gardens and call it "house kudzu," while wild-growing ones are called "wild kudzu." In Japan, it is not cultivated in home gardens. The leaves resemble kidney beans, with three leaves attached at one point forming three corners; some are like azuki bean leaves. Both stem and leaves have hair, and around July they open purple-red flowers like wisteria flowers. They form drooping clusters about three inches long. They produce pods that also have hair. In winter months, the roots are dug up and crushed on stone slabs, the juice removed, and they are well-pounded with metal pestles into fine powder. This undergoes repeated water processing, is placed in basins and dried in the sun, then stored in tubs for shipping (Japanese medical texts call this "water powder"). Kudzu root comes in two varieties at medicine shops: raw-dried and sun-dried. The vines are soaked in water, the bark removed, and woven together...

Totsuka　Currently belongs to Takada. In ancient times, it was the general name for this area. The Hōjō family's property register records that
　Tsuneoka Danjōnochū held the territory of Totsuka at Ushigome. According to Edo Kanoko, in ancient times during floods, this area was spared from water damage as if it were protected by temporary doors, hence the name. However, this is not credible. According to local elders' accounts, there was a place called Totsuka on the grounds of Hōsen-ji temple, and the place name was also called Totsuka village. Now the character "tomi" (冨) has been changed to "to" (戸). / Someone says that in ancient times, on the grounds of a certain Mr. Okamoto's mansion, there was an old mound that served as a white fox's den. Totsuka might be a mispronunciation of "kitsunezuka" (fox mound). Also, since there were many old mounds in this area in the past, it was called "tōtsuka" (ten mounds). / In my opinion, "kitsunezuka" likely refers to the mound beside the Mizuinari shrine. In a booklet called "Takada Hibari," it states that the Totsuka shrine is at Hōsen-ji temple, and since there is a fox-shaped stone door there, it has been called Totsuka since ancient times.

One Hundred and Eight Mounds　Their current location is unknown. According to the oral tradition of local elders, in ancient times, a wealthy person named Shōren
　built a total of 108 mounds between the Takada area and Ōkubo as an offering to Buddha.
　Now, all their locations are completely unknown.
　　In my opinion, there is a Zen temple called Jōgan-ji that serves as the administrator of Kumano Jūnisho Gongen shrine in Nakano village. According to the temple records, there was a descendant of Suzuki Shōji Shigekuni named Suzuki Kurō, who lived in Fujishiro, Kishū, but came to Bushū around the Ōei era and settled in Nakano. His family became very wealthy, but perhaps due to karmic destiny, his daughter died young. Kurō grieved greatly, demolished his residence to make it into a temple, used his daughter's Buddhist name Shōkan as the temple name, and changed his own name to Shōren. Since Shō and Shō are homophonous, these 108 mounds might have been erected by this person. Some say that the current name Kutsukamachi for Babagemachi is a remnant of its old name. / Reconsidering, since this area was once called Totsuka because it was created by a wealthy person, those memorial mounds were called "tomitsuka," and from the medieval period onward, the character "tomi" was abbreviated and mispronounced as "totsuka."

Prince Minamoto no Tsunemoto
【Within Corner-Cut Frame】Around autumn of the second year of Shōhei era, a large stag suddenly leaped out from nowhere at the artificial hill in the imperial palace, attempting to attack the Emperor's sacred body. A court noble who was present tried to ward it off with his sword, but the deer jumped up onto the ridge of the palace building and glared at the imperial residence. Its appearance was terrifying beyond description - its eyeballs were red like vermillion, its mouth was split open to the roots of its ears, and its upper and lower fangs grew irregularly. Tsunemoto nocked a whistling arrow and immediately shot down the deer.

A whistling arrow (kabura) is made of joined parts and breaks apart when it hits the target, so the kabura is depicted on arrows that hit their mark.

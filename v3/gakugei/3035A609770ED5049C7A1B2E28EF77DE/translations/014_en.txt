The Origin of Side Shields【Within Corner-Cut Frame】Empress Jingu (whose posthumous name was Okinagatarashi-hime-no-mikoto, great-granddaughter of Emperor Kaika and consort of Emperor Chuai)
After Emperor Chuai passed away, following the oracle of Sumiyoshi Daimyojin, the Empress herself conquered the Three Kingdoms of Korea. At that time, she was pregnant with Emperor Ojin, and the joints of her armor had gaps that appeared dangerous. Therefore, Minister Takenouchi cut the kusazuri (lower plates) of the armor to cover the gaps, which is said to be the beginning of side shields (waidate). The Empress is revered as Kashii Daimyojin, and Takenouchi is Kora Myojin.

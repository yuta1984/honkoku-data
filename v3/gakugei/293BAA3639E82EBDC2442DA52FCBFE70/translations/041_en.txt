Composing on White Chrysanthemum Flowers (Composing on white chrysanthemum flowers)
Waka poem
Ōshikōchi no Mitsune
"Kokoro ate ni oraba ya oran hatsushimo no oki madowaseru shiragiku no hana"
(If I were to pick them by intuition, which would I choose among the white chrysanthemums that the first frost has made indistinguishable?)

The dimensions of poetry cards (tanzaku) are: width one sun eight bu, length one shaku one sun five bu. However, regarding the length, a slight difference of two or three bu is acceptable. The width appears to have little variation. According to another theory, the width is one sun nine bu and the length is one shaku two sun.

When sending tanzaku paper to someone, stack however many sheets there are, tie the ends in two places with thin paper, wrap them in paper called "hikiawase," place them in a willow box, and tie by threading cord through the box from underneath in two places.

When there is a poetry theme and tanzaku are being sent, even for one or two poems, fold each separately into three parts, wrap each one individually, place them in a willow box, and tie them.

Pocket Paper (Kaishi) and Poetry Cards (Tanzaku)

For paper used to write poetry, there are varieties including pocket paper, poetry cards, and colored paper, each with various rules. I record their outline here.

The dimensions of pocket paper used by ministers, major counselors, middle counselors, and councilors are one shaku three sun. They use large high-grade mulberry paper wrapped for use. The pocket paper used by court nobles of fourth, fifth, and sixth ranks is one shaku two sun. However, for private gatherings, small high-grade mulberry paper is used. It appears that various retainers should use small high-grade mulberry paper cut to one shaku five or six bu.

The method of writing on pocket paper is: for one poem, three lines with three characters. For two or three poems, it should be two lines with seven characters. From twenty to one hundred poems, it is two lines. For five or seven poems, two sheets of paper are joined together for use. For ten poems, three sheets are joined. For twenty or more poems, the number of paper sheets is not fixed.

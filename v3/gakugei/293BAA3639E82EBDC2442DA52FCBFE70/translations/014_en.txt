It is called waka (Japanese poetry). Since poems composed by one hundred people were written one poem each, it is also called Hyakunin Isshu (One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets). On those colored paper sheets, only the poems were written without the authors' names. Later, his son Tameie had them collected and compiled, recording the authors and spreading them to the world. Among the books that provide commentary on Hyakunin Isshu are Shūisuishō 《marginal note: composed by Kitamura Kigin》and Kaikanshō 《marginal note: composed by the monk Keichū》. The Hyakunin Isshu consists of:

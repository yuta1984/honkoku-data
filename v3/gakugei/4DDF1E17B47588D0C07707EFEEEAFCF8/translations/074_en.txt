　About Spring and Autumn Celebratory Months《Including auspicious calligraphy poems and Tanabata poems》

The reason January is called "Mutsuki" (Month of Intimacy) is that even
family members, relatives, friends and peers who are usually distant
come every day to hold banquets and intimately
associate with each other, hence the name. Sacred rope decorations are truly
symbols of the land of the gods, and standing pine and bamboo
at the gate imitates Mount Hōrai, celebrating
immortality and eternal youth. In general, this month is the beginning
of the year, the start of months and days, gathering all
auspicious things, removing misfortunes of the year, and
inviting good fortune.

New Year's Calligraphy Poems:

　I write and store myriad treasures
Even as I look upon the ancient Sumiyoshi
　Shore pine, how many ages has it endured?

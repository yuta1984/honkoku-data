The heart of this poem is that contemplation comes from within oneself, not at anyone else's request. During the day one can find distractions, but at night, facing the moon, one feels the sadness of being unthought of by others. Though the moon seems to cause melancholy thoughts, upon reflection, it is not really the moon that causes such thoughts. How foolish that my tears fall in such a complaining manner—this reflects on the foolishness of my own heart. He criticizes the heart that said "my complaining tears." The word "yaha" should be given full consideration. "Kakotsu" (to complain/blame) changes meaning depending on the context. This "kakotsu" carries the sense of resentment.
　There is also a resentful heart.

Does the moon
tell me to lament
and cause me
to think sadly?

The heart of this poem is that mountains with maki trees should be understood as deeply profound mountains. The autumn evening is indescribably beautiful, and after a brief shower has fallen, before the dew has even dried, mist rises up—the scene is beyond description. Unless one becomes one with that moment and that feeling, the subtlety of the scene cannot be grasped. It is a wonder difficult to capture in thirty-one syllables. In autumn, because there is warmth in the earth, when rainwater falls, it steams up and rises as mist.

The heart of this poem is about the autumn wind of Mount Yoshino as the night deepens. When you listen carefully, the autumn pathos becomes poignant, and especially in an old village, the sound of fulling cloth makes the cold of sleeping alone even more chilling. The chirping of insects throughout the night should also be contemplated in the heart of this poem. Though it seems like nothing special, the pathos runs deep.
○Kigin's commentary notes that during Emperor Tenmu's reign, the Yoshino Kunisu people offered grass, fish, water dropwort and such as imperial food, hiding them under boats when presenting them.

The heart of this poem is that "ōkenaku" means "presumptuously" or "beyond one's station." "Waga tatsu soma" refers to Mount Hiei. Though he is a monk who should live on this mountain and compassionately protect the people of the world like children, covering them with his sleeves, he reflects that a thoughtless person like himself merely resides as master of this mountain in vain.
○Kigin's commentary notes that for someone of shallow wisdom and few virtues to serve as head priest protecting the peace of the realm represents a heart of humble self-deprecation.

How presumptuously
I cover
the suffering
people of the world
with sleeves dyed black
on the wooded mountain where I dwell

【Note: "Obokenaku" and "ōkenaku" have different meanings. Here it should be "ōkenaku." In this document's "Hundred Poems Brief Commentary and Genealogies" section (frames 18-68), all the voiced marks in the scattered writing of the waka in the lower sections are marked with two white hollow circles "◦", but this word alone has two black ink dots, suggesting it may be a later addition.】

The meaning of this poem: Takashi no hama is a famous place. It alludes to how even hearing rumors of a fickle person makes them well-known. If those fickle waves were to splash, my sleeves—if I think of you as someone I once promised myself to, even though you're fickle, I cannot abandon you completely—this is a reply poem saying "no" to such a person from the beginning. "Sleeves getting wet" refers to tears. From "hearing by reputation" to "lest my sleeves get wet," everything on the surface uses wave-related wordplay. It's a poem that speaks completely without forcing connections between heart and words.
○Seasonal commentary: "Lest they get wet" means "lest they become soaked."

The meaning of this poem: Takasago is a famous place, also a general name for mountains, being a high mountain. Even mountains without blooming flowers, when mist hangs over their peaks, are beautiful. When flowers bloom, it becomes like mist. He says it would just be standing there. According to Genshi, this Takasago is a general name for mountains, not a specific famous place. The meaning is clear. It's a poem in the orthodox style. The language is simply refreshing and substantial. However, it's somewhat less vivid than Nōin's "Storm-blown Mount Mimuro."
○Seasonal commentary: "Have bloomed" shows a heart stirred by seeing cherry blossoms anew.

have bloomed—
may the mist on distant mountains
not rise

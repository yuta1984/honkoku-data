The heart is something that can be reformed
The thirty-two marks of Buddha are also within one's heart
Though people say the afterlife is important
Without the union of yin and yang (male and female), there is no way
There have been many wise women in the world
Being lovingly devoted to parents
Being harmonious with father-in-law and mother-in-law
Treasuring one's husband and maintaining the household

Facing the mirror morning and evening
At times of applying makeup and grooming

The flourishing future like fresh green
For countless generations, prosperously
One should spend auspicious springs

【Right page, upper section】
Do not speak of important matters to others
Treating things carelessly loses what is precious
The most important thing is fire prevention
Pay attention to sewing and needlework
Living within one's means is proper household management
It is good to know your own station in life
Do not wear clothing beyond your station
As for tools you have borrowed
Even if you may borrow again, return them quickly
Those who think themselves clever
And argue down their husband's words
Speaking presumptuously about things
Are hateful to observe from the sidelines
Even grooming oneself too fashionably

【Left page, upper section】
Consider the feelings of people in society
Be mindful of heat and cold for others
Even if you are the child of a virtuous person
Do not put on airs and boast about it
Those who act high and mighty
Are the source of people's hatred
When you hear bad things about people

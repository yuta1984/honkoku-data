○Semimaru
Semimaru of Ōsaka was a religious practitioner during Emperor Ninmyō's time.
He never shaved his hair, and people called him "the old man" or sometimes "immortal sage."
According to Lord Sankōin's explanation, it is incorrect for people to say he was blind. The headnote to this poem in the "Gosen Wakashū" states "seeing travelers at Ōsaka Barrier."
If he were blind, he could not have seen anything.
It is also incorrect to say he was a prince of Emperor Daigo. According to certain commentaries,
someone stated that in old documents he is written as "the old man of Ōsaka" and was a layman. Sometimes called a child, sometimes a monk. Since he was one who did not shave his hair, there is no contradiction in any of these.

The meaning of this poem is about those who go and return, those who know and don't know, those who part and wander temporarily, all passing through Ōsaka Barrier. However, if one seeks to reach the capital of enlightenment, thinking of this barrier makes meeting difficult—he composed this contemplating the world. This poem appears as "parting constantly" in the Gosenshū. The headnote states "living in a hermitage at Ōsaka Barrier, seeing travelers pass by." "Koreya kono" is a five-syllable preface (jo) leading to Ōsaka Barrier.
On the surface, it depicts travelers coming and going.
The deeper meaning expresses the Buddhist concept that all who meet must part.
○The "Inyitsu-den" states: "Semimaru's birthplace is unknown. He built a grass hut at Ōsaka Barrier, was skilled in waka poetry and the wagon (Japanese zither). Because Semimaru separated himself from the mundane world, he was merely called blind."

The meaning of this poem is thinking of the vast sea surface and the endless destinations of countless islands. Especially the heart of one sent into exile is lonely—tell the fishing boat returning toward me, tell those heartless fishermen of my sorrow that cannot be expressed. The headnote in the Kokinshū states "sent to someone in the capital when boarding a ship to depart after being exiled to Oki Province." The heart first expressed as "Wada no hara" is deeply moving. Even ordinary people would find a sea journey unreliable, but much more so for one who has become an exile crossing unknown wave-paths—the feeling is beyond comparison. In the "Tales of Ise," writing a letter "to that person in the capital," it teaches: "At Utsu mountain pass in Suruga, neither in reality nor in dreams do I meet that person." Therefore, here too, referring to "my wife," he also says "person."

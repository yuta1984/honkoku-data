Sanuki no Kami Kanefusa devoted himself to waka poetry, but lamenting the difficulty of improving his verse, he prayed to Kakinomoto no Hitomaro. In a dream, he saw Hitomaro standing in a place where plum blossoms were scattered about. After this, every poem he composed became an excellent verse without exception. This is called "Sato no Ama no Hitomaro" (Hitomaro of the Village Fisherman).

The plum blossoms cannot even be distinguished—
From the eternal heavens the snow
Falls everywhere

This poem is said to be by Sato no Ama no Hitomaro.

Regarding the beginning of waka poetry, it is written in the preface to the Kokin Wakashū that this poetry arose from when heaven and earth first opened. In the eternal heavens it began with Shitateru-hime, but the characters were not yet clear.
When Susanoo no Mikoto built a palace in Izumo Province, seeing the eight-colored clouds rising, he composed:

Eight clouds rising, Izumo's eightfold fence—
To enclose my wife, I build an eightfold fence,
That eightfold fence.

From this divine poem, the thirty-one syllable form was established.

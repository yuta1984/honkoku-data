○Daisōjō Gyōson
Founding master of Ennman-in at Miidera, Tendai-no-zasu Hōmu.
According to the Genkō Shakusho, Gyōson was the son of Kangi-dayū Minamoto no Motohira. At age twelve, he entered Miidera under Myōkyō and became a monk.
The Zoku Yotsugi states: "The Sōjō Gyōson of Byōdō-in, who resided at Miidera, was a renowned ascetic practitioner. He practiced for long periods not only at Ōmine and Katsuragi, but also in mountains of distant provinces."

The meaning of this poem: When he entered Mount Ōmine for religious training, the appearance of this mountain was unfamiliar down to the very plants and trees, making him feel lonely. Standing beneath blooming cherry trees, he composed this poem saying that both the flowers and he himself could only share their pathos together, with no one else to understand. One should deeply contemplate the scene when this person of noble birth, having changed into humble attire, entered this mountain for ascetic practice and beheld such cherry blossoms.

○Seasonal commentary: Do not resent being in a foreign land with few kindred spirits. The slender willow turns green before all others.

let us feel
the pathos,
mountain cherry—
other than your blossoms
there is no one who understands

The meaning of this poem: Late one night at court, when the naishi was asked if she wanted a pillow, someone put his arm inside the curtain saying "use this as a pillow," so she composed this poem. The headnote states: "Around the second month, on a bright moonlit night at Nijō-in, when many people were sitting together, Suhō no Naishi lay down and quietly said 'I wish I had a pillow.' Hearing this, Dainagon Tadaie said 'use this as a pillow' and extended his arm from beneath the curtain, so she composed this poem."

How precious is
the reputation
that will uselessly
arise from this
arm-pillow
that lasts only
as long as
a spring
night's
dream

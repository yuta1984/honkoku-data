The meaning of this poem is: "For whose sake did my heart begin to become disordered? It is only for you that it becomes disordered." This refers to cloth woven from Shinobu District in Ōshū. Because it alludes to the disorder of the pattern, it says "shinobu" and continues with "disordered." This is a poem from the "topic unknown" section of the Kokinshū. The meaning is that the first two lines serve as a preface to say "disordered." The Kokinshū has "I am not one who thinks to become disordered." Also said: In Shinobu District of Ōshū, they rub shinobu grass into patterns. Because the pattern is rubbed in a disordered way, this serves as a preface to say "disordered." The Ise Monogatari has "someishi." In the Ise Monogatari, because it was interesting in connection with Narihira's reply "the disorder of shinobu knows no limit," it became a response poem ○ How I wish to let it be known that love makes me think in such disorder, the shinobu-rubbing of the heart's depths

The meaning of this poem is that on the seventh day of the first month, when giving people the seven herbs of young greens, he composed this. Before ascending to the throne, when he was still a prince: "For you, my lord, I go out to spring fields to pick young greens, while snow keeps falling on my sleeves." Despite the severe cold and snow on his robes, his considerate heart thinking of others while enduring the cold is admirable. This poem is said to be composed when the Emperor Nin'na was a prince and gave young greens to people. Emperor Nin'na refers to Emperor Kōkō. "Giving young greens" means giving celebration. Anyone who takes herb soup on Jinjitsu (the seventh day) will ward off a hundred illnesses. This is found in works called "Jingchu Suishiji" and "Taisōka-kun." The seven herbs are mentioned in a poem: "Water dropwort, turnip, shepherd's purse, chickweed, Buddha's seat, turnip, radish—these are the seven herbs."

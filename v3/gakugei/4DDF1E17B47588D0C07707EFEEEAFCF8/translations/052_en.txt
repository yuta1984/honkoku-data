The meaning of this poem: When his illness would not heal, he thought of abdicating the throne, and though it was not his heart's desire, if he were to live longer, he would surely long for the moon over the imperial palace in autumn. 
○The seasonal commentary states: If one were to live long against one's true wishes, how dearly one would miss the moon over the familiar golden halls and jeweled towers. One should not limit oneself to viewing only the midnight moon—there would be many occasions for reminiscing about the past.

in this
sorrowful world,
how dear would be
the midnight moon

The meaning of this poem: One should not think it disappointing when the storm scatters the autumn leaves of Mount Mimuro. The beauty lies in how the storm transforms them into the brocade of the Tatsuta River. The headnote in the Goshūi-shū autumn section states it was "composed at a poetry contest at the imperial palace in Eishō 4." This poem has no hidden meanings. One should simply contemplate it by considering the seasonal atmosphere and the nature of the place. To vividly bring forth the scene requires one's utmost effort.
○Seasonal commentary: The water flows from Mimuro, and below it becomes the Tatsuta River. The autumn leaves of Mount Mimuro scattered by the storm become the brocade of the Tatsuta River.

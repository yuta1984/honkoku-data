○Sone no Yoshitada
His ancestry is unclear
Said to be a person from around the Kanna era
Said to have been appointed as Tamba-no-jō (Assistant Governor of Tamba)
Therefore called Sotan

From Shin-Kokin Collection:
At Yura Harbor
　in the province
　　of Kii, even
the jewels said
　to be gathered there—
　I wish I could meet them

　Reference poem

　The rudder severed,
　　life too
　　　severed, let me
　inform you
　　in this bay
　　　of tears
　　the boat
　　　　sinks, boatman

The meaning of this poem: there is no means to approach in my path of love, unable to abandon these thoughts that continue to accumulate, not knowing where they lead. It is compared to a boatman crossing Yura Strait whose rudder has been severed. Yura Harbor is in Kii Province. According to Genshi, this Yura Strait must be a place where waves are rough. The meaning is that a boat crossing the great ocean would lose its support without a rudder. Like that boat, my path of love has no reliable means and knows not where it leads.

A person from around the Kanna era

From Shoku-Kokin Collection:
　Prince Nakatsukasa-kyō

People may visit
　this dwelling
　　of mugura vines
　　　in the moonlight

though dew
　　cannot be seen,

　the autumn wind
　　　　does
　　　blow

【Same Page - Middle Section】
The meaning of this poem: although this is a dwelling overgrown with mugura vines, autumn certainly comes to visit. In the end, people do not visit such a dwelling. A dwelling of mugura vines belongs to the ruins of autumn. Sōgi says: Though the meaning is clear from the headnote, the past glory of the minister is like a dream, and the way he laments with pity that only autumn returns without forgetting the past is incomparably excellent. One should view this poem while thoroughly contemplating the past of Kawara-no-in.
○Kigin's note: Though people may not visit this lonely dwelling of mugura vines, even autumn has come on top of that.

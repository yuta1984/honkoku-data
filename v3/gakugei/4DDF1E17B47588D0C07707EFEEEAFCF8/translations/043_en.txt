○Fujiwara no Yoshitaka
Right Minor Captain, Junior Fifth Rank Lower
Third son of Duke Kentoku, called Later Minor Captain. His mother was the daughter of Middle Palace Minister Prince Taimei.
The Genkō Shakusho states: "Urin-jishō Fujiwara no Yoshitaka was the fourth son of Grand Master Duke Kentoku. Between court duties he recited the Lotus Sutra and permanently abstained from meat and strong-smelling vegetables. In the second year of Tenryaku, autumn, he fell ill and passed away while reciting the Hōben chapter" (abbreviated below).

Saigyō Hōshi's poem
Shin Kokin Collection
　Until we could meet
　　even life itself
　　　　I thought precious

How regretful it was,
　　this heart of mine

【Same Page - Middle Section】
The meaning of this poem is about the morning after meeting one's lover. While we hadn't met, I thought I would gladly give my life to meet you, but it was because I had life that we were able to meet. Now life is even more precious. This should indeed be deeply moving. While the meaning is generally clear, there is something noteworthy in the phrase "omoi keru kana." Given the intensity of longing for someone, one should carefully observe the part that says "how long my heart has been thinking without my realizing it." This "kana" means "kaeru kana" (how it changes). Also, "nuru kana" expresses past sentiment, while "arikeru kana" expresses the heart of this poem.
○According to Kigin's commentary: "The life that until yesterday I thought I would gladly sacrifice to meet you, after one night together, today I again think of life until we meet—this must be an especially deep love."

Nōin Hōshi's poem

How pointless—
　Mount Ibuki's
　　sashimo grass,
　with my own
　　　　feelings
　　I burn my body
　　　　　　continuously

【Same Page - Middle Section】
The meaning of this poem is that I cannot even say "like this" or "like that." Sashimo grass refers to mugwort. Though it is truly like setting fire to one's body and enduring it, the reason for never speaking is that people would not understand this heart. This Sanekata was a courtier contemporary with Fujiwara no Yukinari, and during an argument he struck off Yukinari's cap with his shaku (ceremonial baton). However, Yukinari acted as if nothing had happened, put his cap back on, arranged his hair, and stood calmly without his complexion changing. When the Emperor observed this, he sent Sanekata away as Governor of Mutsu, telling him to "go see the poetic places."
○Kigin's commentary: Though this is based on the poem "shall I burn my body with my own feelings," the meaning is well understood through "sashimo" of sashimo grass and "the fires of passionate love that burn readily."

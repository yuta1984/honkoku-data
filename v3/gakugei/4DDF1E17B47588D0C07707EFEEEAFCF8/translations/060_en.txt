The heart of this poem reflects: if one lives long, will these current times also be remembered fondly? What was once called sorrowful and painful is now yearned for, contemplating future matters in advance. It expresses resentment toward the past as everything gradually declines. According to Genshi's interpretation, the poem's meaning is clear: as one increasingly thinks of the past, even the times we now consider sorrowful may be fondly remembered in the future—this is a poem that resonates with everyone's heart. People simply rely on a future that should not be relied upon.
○Seasonal note: Perhaps a poem about the poignant longing for the bygone past

The heart of this poem expresses how on nights of deep contemplation, dawn comes slowly, and even the light through the gaps in the sleeping quarters seems indifferent in its reluctant breaking. Sōgi commented that the phrase "even the gaps in the sleeping quarters" is remarkable, showing the intensity of the speaker's feelings. To resent what should not be resented, to find dear what should not be dear, to see everything in terms of that beloved's image—this is the way of love. One should deeply contemplate the significance of lamenting "even the gaps in the sleeping quarters." It is said that in the Kuse area of Yamashiro Province, there was a temple called Sakurada-ji where Monk Shun'e lived.

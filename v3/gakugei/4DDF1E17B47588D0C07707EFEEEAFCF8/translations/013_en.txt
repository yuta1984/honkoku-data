About Murasaki Shikibu's creation of The Tale of Genji

Murasaki Shikibu was a court lady serving Empress Jōtōmon'in, consort of Emperor Ichijō (the 66th emperor). Initially called Fuji no Shikibu, she had been deeply devoted to the way of waka poetry since childhood and was renowned for her excellent poems. Among her celebrated works, one poem selected for the Senzaishū collection reads: "Shall I view the waterfowl as strangers upon the water? I too drift through this floating world."

During the time when she was composing such famous poems, the Saiin (Imperial Princess serving at Ise Shrine) requested to see some rare illustrated tales. Consequently, Shikibu was commissioned to create a story. This happened on the night of August 15th. While staying at Ishiyama Temple in devotion to Kannon, Shikibu gazed upon the lake and conceived the plot for The Tale of Genji, eventually completing all fifty-four chapters. The Wakamurasaki (Young Murasaki) chapter was particularly praised for its beauty, and from this she came to be called Murasaki Shikibu. According to another theory, Shikibu was the daughter of Emperor Ichijō's wet nurse, and when she entered service with the Empress, she was introduced as "one with connections - please regard her with compassion." From this connection (yukari), meaning the color of kinship, she came to be called both Fuji no Shikibu and Murasaki.

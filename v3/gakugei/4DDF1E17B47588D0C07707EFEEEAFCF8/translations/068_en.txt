The heart of this poem: "momoshiki" refers to the seats where the hundred court officials sit in the imperial palace. "Ancient eaves" expresses his lament over the decline of the royal way, and from "eaves" he composed about "shinobu" (remembering/longing). This refers to the shinobu fern that grows on eaves. "Even in remembrance there is still too much of the past"—he grieves over the declined royal way. The opening poem "Aki no ta" (autumn fields) expresses his imperial concern for the people of a well-governed reign.
○Kigin's commentary notes that the word "shinobu" has different meanings: enduring, hiding, yearning in love—all with different nuances. The "remembering the past" here means a heart that longs for bygone days.

Murasaki Shikibu says: All people, when things do not go as they wish, readily accept others' admonitions and have a heart that keeps to the right path. When their desires are fulfilled and they can do as they please, they all become arrogant, despising what is noble and scorning what is humble. For this reason, the various buddhas and gods find it difficult to fulfill people's wishes. Rather than granting wishes and making people worse, not granting them and making people better is truly the embodiment of great compassion and great mercy.

The meaning of this poem is that it is an imperial poem for the seasonal clothing change on the 1st day of the 4th month. The mountain that was hazy during the three months of spring now, today, has its haze cleared early and the clouds appear white and pure, as if summer robes were being dried. Long ago, celestial beings hung and dried their robes on this mountain, which is why it is called Mount Kaguyama. This poem is included at the beginning of the summer section of the Shin Kokin-shū. In relation to the passage in the Tales of Ise that says "would that I had answered 'dew' and vanished," it is also included in the love section. In both cases, it was carefully selected and included. An anthology that properly divides its categorical organization should be like this.
○According to Kigin's commentary, rather than simply saying "summer," saying "spring has passed and summer has come" better expresses the progression into early summer.

○Kakinomoto no Hitomaro
He was a person from the reign of Emperor Tenji. According to Lord Atsumitsu's praise of Hitomaro: "Court gentleman, family name Kakinomoto, given name Hitomaro, presumably a poet of ancient times. He served during the sacred reigns of Jitō and Monmu, and had audiences with Princes Nitta and Takechi."
Shōtetsu said that Hitomaro's death anniversary is kept as a secret matter, so generally few people know it. It is the 18th day of the 3rd month.

The meaning of this poem is that "ashihiki" is a makura-kotoba (pillow word) for referring to mountains, and "yamadori" (mountain bird) is for saying things like "long and lengthy." Even sleeping with two people during the long autumn nights would be melancholy, so how much more unbearable to sleep alone. One theory states that when the king's army was defeated in Koguryō and he fled to mountain valleys with his empress, she injured her foot, which is why it's called "ashihiki no yama" (foot-pulling mountain). There are no other particular interpretations. Simply by beginning with "ashihiki no," then saying "yamadori no o no shidari o no" (the mountain bird's trailing tail), and then "naganagashi yo wo" (through the long, long night), the style expresses limitless poetic sentiment and is most excellent.
○According to Kigin's commentary, rather than simply saying "long night," saying "long, long night" makes the loneliness of sleeping alone sound limitless.

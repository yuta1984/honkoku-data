Look back and reflect upon your own circumstances
Even if you say you pray for the afterlife
Do not become too intimate with Buddhist clergy
If you please your father-in-law and husband
And manage the household splendidly
That itself is Buddha
No matter what good deeds you may perform
Those who become wives of men
Without properly fulfilling the way of a wife
Will not be accepted by gods or Buddha
As bad habits of unworthy women:
Handling matters carelessly and presumptuously
Knowing nothing at all about household management
Fond of sightseeing and temple visits

Speaking of others and boasting
Drinking tea for long periods and being short-tempered
Having shallow emotions while trying to curry favor
Regretting things and being deeply greedy
Creating discord between people and bullying others
Making hasty decisions without proper control
Being presumptuous and eavesdropping
Interrupting people's conversations
Speaking in a twisted manner
Speaking maliciously with snide remarks
Ruining things through impatience
Flying into uncontrollable rage and raising one's voice
When the husband is away, inviting people over
And wildly pursuing men

○Yamabe no Akahito
There is a theory to read it as "Akami" with a voiced consonant, but it is better to simply read it as "Akahito."
His paternal lineage is unclear. He was a person from around the Jinki era.
Like Hitomaro, this involves secret traditions.
Yamabe is his family name. It takes a place name as the family name. There is a theory that he violated Hitomaro's empress and was exiled, but was recalled during the Man'yōshū period and changed his name to Akahito.
In the preface to the Kokin-shū, it says "There is a person called Yamabe no Akahito. It would be difficult for Hitomaro to stand above Akahito, and difficult for Akahito to stand below Hitomaro."
It is clear that they were different people.

The meaning of this poem is that when rowing a boat out to Tago Bay and looking back, one can see the snow on Mount Fuji's high peak. The vista is limitless, beyond what words can express, but one should contemplate and appreciate the feeling of seeing snow on the high peak. Both the fascinating aspects of the seashore and the magnificence of the high peak cannot be fully expressed in words, so describing only their appearance is most appropriate. The Kokin-shū described people's poems as "mysteriously excellent in poetry." It has a wondrous quality.
Furthermore, the lingering emotion in "snow continues to fall" is limitless.
○According to Kigin's commentary, the scenery of going out to Tago Bay and viewing Mount Fuji's high peak is beyond what words can explain, so by describing only its appearance, poetic charm is naturally contained within. If so, explaining this poem is also beyond what the tongue can accomplish.

○Sarumaru-dayū
According to ancient traditions, his court rank, family name, era, etc. are unknown. According to a certain genealogy, Emperor Yōmei → Prince Shōtoku → Prince Yamashiro no Ōe → Prince Yuge, who was called Sarumaru-dayū. According to Kamo no Chōmei's Hōjōki, there are old sites of Sarumaru-dayū in Takami, Ōmi Province.
According to Gion's commentary, it refers to Prince Yuge Dōkyō, son of Emperor Tenmu. This theory is unclear.
Prince Yuge, grandson of Prince Shōtoku, was called Sarumaru, but calling him the monk Dōkyō was probably a mistake based on the name Yuge.

The meaning of this poem is that while autumn is said to be poignant from early autumn onward, with flowers scattering in disorder, dew and moon being beautiful, and the sounds of all insects being charming, when late autumn arrives and the scenery becomes complete with fallen leaves creating a desolate atmosphere, the season when deer cry unable to bear their longing for mates is when autumn is truly sad. The five characters "oku yama ni" (in the deep mountains) also have deep resonance. In its original nature, when the autumn leaves of the mountains scatter and one asks what time of autumn is sad, it means the autumn when deer cry in melancholy is the most sorrowful. This autumn refers to the autumn of the world.
○According to the Fusō Initsuden, he was a person from Fukakusa village. To this day, the local people call it Fukakusa and say this is Sarumaru's village. It is unknown what era he was from. Some say it was around the Gangyō period.

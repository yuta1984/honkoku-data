Though there are various contemporary hairstyles, they are all
styles first created by courtesans and such, becoming
fashionable, so their manner is gaudy,
vulgar, and unsightly. One should simply style the hair
in a manner appropriate to one's station. However,
since there are distinctions between court style, warrior house style, and townspeople's style,
one should follow the customs
of one's place. It is also inappropriate to
adopt ancient hairstyles simply because old-fashioned is considered good.

It is fine for young ladies-in-waiting to follow contemporary fashion,
but they should style their hair
so as not to be too conspicuous.
As is the habit of elderly people,
they speak of the fashions of their youth
and criticize current fashions, but this is a great
mistake. That all things change from time to time
is not limited to hair fashions. The dyed colors and patterns of kosode,
and even the shapes of combs and hairpins
all change completely within ten or twenty years.
It is precisely because they change that craftsmen and merchants can conduct

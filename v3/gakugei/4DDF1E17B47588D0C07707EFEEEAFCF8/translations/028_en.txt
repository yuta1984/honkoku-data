The meaning of this poem: "ima wa" should be understood as "now indeed." Like the stakes planted as deep markers in the sea where one exhausts oneself, resembling "mi wo tsukushi" (exhausting oneself), though there may be no time to dry one's sleeves while lamenting morning and evening, if one could meet and communicate just once. The poem's headnote states it was "sent to the Kyōgoku Imperial Consort after the affair was exposed." This was during Emperor Uda's reign, when this consort was secretly visiting Minister Tokihira's mother, but after the affair was discovered, this poem was sent. "Koto no dekite" refers to when a scandal or troublesome situation arose. These five syllables "wabinureba" should not be treated carelessly. The "Shūchūshō" states that according to national histories, this refers to the first placing of channel markers at Naniwa Bay. The specific year has not yet been determined.

○Priest Sosei
His secular name was Harutoshi, also called Akitoki. He was the son of Yoshimine no Munesada.

When he went to Henjō, [Henjō] said "A priest's son should indeed be a priest" and had him enter the priesthood. This account appears in the "Yamato Monogatari."

The meaning of this poem is not about a single night, but rather: from early autumn when you said "I will come now," I have been waiting hopefully, and now I have waited until the dawn moon of the ninth month. How deeply moving. This poem means "I have waited for the dawn moon to appear." Akisho interprets this as referring to a single night, but Lord Teika's interpretation is different. It asks how many nights of the moon have accumulated - from early autumn, autumn has already ended and the moon has become the dawn moon. This represents a difference between other schools and our school.
The Gi commentary states: "This is a skillfully composed poem that captures the heart of waiting for the dawn moon to appear."

【Title within thick frame】Moral teachings in short poems about one's own life
Spending days under this falling rain
The words I entrust to my brush
Are not empty words from above
Do not think of this as someone else's affair
It is the way of parents who are human
Not considering their advancing age
Wishing that their children will someday
Become adults and be gentle and mature
This is the way of parents
Though they devote their hearts morning and evening
Children do not realize this
If one does not think this hateful

Such is the pathos of those who are parents
Therefore, within heaven and earth
Though there are many various paths
Filial piety to parents is the foundation
Among strangers too, one will be trusted
And gods and Buddhas will protect you
Especially for women, who before long
Will marry into other families
The time spent with parents is brief
Devote your heart and be filial
After marriage through matrimonial ties
Revere your lord husband, and never
Speak rudely or impertinently
Even if married to a poor man

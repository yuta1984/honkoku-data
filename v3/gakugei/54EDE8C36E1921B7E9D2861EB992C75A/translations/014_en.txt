it is said. 《Note: According to one person's theory, Akasaka is named after the slope near Mount Akane, but the place name Akasaka appears in the Odawara Hojo family's domain register from Eiroku 12 (1571) as "Edo Akasaka Six Villages, Lord Chiba's domain"》
《Note: The Musashi Province Gazetteer mentions Akasaka-sho in Ebara District, but now it belongs to Toshima District》

Hikawa Myojin Shrine　Located in Akasaka Imai. 《Note: This place is commonly called Mikawa-dai. During the Tenwa era, it was the estate of Lord Matsudaira Mikawa-no-kami, hence the name》 The betto (temple administrator) is
the head of the Shugoin sect called Daishoin. The enshrined deity is the same as the provincial first shrine (Musashi Province Hikawa Shrine).
It serves as the general tutelary shrine of Akasaka, with festivals held every other year on June 15th, alternating with Sanno Gongen at Nagata Baba.
《Note: According to documents like Edo Meisho-shi and Sokanoko, this shrine was originally in Hitotsugi Village but was relocated to its current location in Kyoho 15 (1730), when new shrine buildings were constructed》
《Note: Upon examination, while various documents mention that this shrine was called Koroko-no-miya and was moved from Hitotsugi to its current location during the Kyoho period, the details are unclear. In the Kanbun Edo map, what is called Koroko-no-miya is recorded at present-day Hitotsugi》
《Note: Hikawa Myojin is recorded at its current location in the same map, so they appear to be separate shrines》
《Note: According to Edo Meisho-ki, during the Tenryaku era (947-957), there was a monk called Renrin in Koga District of Omi Province who upheld the Tendai Shiming dharma lamp and concentrated on the meditation practice of "three thousand realms in a single thought." During his pilgrimage to the eastern provinces, he spent a night at this location, received a divine revelation in a dream, and discovered an eleven-faced Kannon statue from the earth, which he enshrined here, calling it Hitotsugi Kannon. After Renrin's death, in Jiryaku 2 (1066), there was a great drought in Kanto, and when the people prayed for rain at this shrine with miraculous results, it came to be revered as Hikawa Myojin》

Koroko Tenjin Shrine　Located in the same area, in the Hitotsugi district of Akasaka Tamachi. Sometimes written as Koroku. The betto is
of the Soto Zen sect called Seitokuji.
The remnant of Musashi Province Gazetteer states: "Ebara District Akasaka-sho Koroku Tenjin or Koroko, sacred rice fields thirty-five bundles, three-mow rice fields, Emperor Tenmu 3rd year Kinoe-inu

November began divine rituals, having shrine households and shrine maiden households, enshrining Onamuchi and Sukunahikona, Korean deities, called Koroku after the name of Koroko Hill"
《Note: Upon examination, according to a book called "Murasaki no Hitomoto," this great deity was originally located at a place called Kiroko near Hachioji in this province, and the Hikawa Myojin from that location was moved to this place. Dokan's writings mention something about "Kiroko no soregashi." Also, the same book and others like "Edo Meisho Hanashi" mention that during the Keicho era, there was a horseman called Koroku in Kanto, known for his beauty, who lived in this Akasaka. He constantly revered Hikawa Myojin, and later his family became wealthy, leading to the restoration of the deteriorated shrine buildings. Hence it came to be called Koroku-no-miya, though there is no solid evidence. "Edo Meguri" states that Koroku Myojin is a manifestation of Prince Yamato Takeru, but various theories abound and the details remain unclear. For now, it may be best to follow the gazetteer's account, though further investigation is needed》

Shinkosan Ryusenji Temple　Located in the same area, Hitotsugi-cho, on the right side from the road. It belongs to the Jodo sect
under Kyoto's Chion-in. The founding priest is called Zuiryu Osho. It was established in Kanei 11 (1634).
The temple's Butsugen Osho had a deep commitment to supporting the sect and once authored and published the thousand-volume "Jishin-roku,"
widely distributing it to students. He was from Owari Province. The temple enshrines Koyasu Kanzeon (Child-bearing Kannon),
a Sho-kannon statue said to be carved by Dengyo Daishi. In the same hall, a Yakushi Buddha
is also enshrined, also said to be by the same maker. They are popularly known as Hitotsugi Kannon and Hitotsugi Yakushi. The main Buddha is a standing
statue of Amida Nyorai, over three feet tall, carved by Gyoki. The flanking statues of Kannon and Seishi
are by unknown makers. There is also a Tenmangu shrine within the temple grounds with Inari as a co-enshrined deity.

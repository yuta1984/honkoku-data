For the purpose of koan study, it is not inconvenient, and it would be quite appropriate to strive earnestly to revere the Buddha's teachings and the patriarchal tradition.

Hikawa Myojin Shrine is located beside the Shibuya River. According to tradition, it was established through the solicitation of Right General Minamoto no Yoritomo. It serves as the tutelary deity of this area, with its festival held on September 29th. On this day, sumo wrestling is performed in front of the shrine. The temple administrator belongs to the Tendai sect and is called Enichisan Yakuo-in Hosen-ji. It was founded by the Great Master Jikaku, with Yakushi Nyorai as the principal deity. (The author is not clearly known)

The Shibuya River flows in front of the temple. On the northern bank stands a Shingon Ritsu temple called Genshūzan Shitsen-ji. It is a quiet and secluded place. (Recently, the monk Hōnyo also resides here)

Kon'ōmaru's Guardian Buddha, the True Kannon, is enshrined in a Zen temple called Jiunzan Chōsen-ji in Upper Shibuya. The principal deity Kanzeon is said to be carved by Unkei and was the sacred image revered by Kon'ōmaru. The founding priest was Zuiō Oshō, and the restorer was called Fuchūteki.

Tsurugaya (Crane Valley) is said to be in the same area, but its location is now unknown. According to tradition, in the second year of Kenkyū (1191), cranes kept by Right General Yoritomo built their nests in this area, hence the name Tsurugaya or Tsurusawa.

Hanezawa is also said to be in the same location. (Hanezawa has a Zen temple of the Kyoto Myōshin-ji sect called Fukōzan Kyūkō-ji)

Asagiri Falls is also said to be in the same area, but the exact location is still unknown. According to local legend, long ago there lived a wealthy man named Shibuya Sōshun in this area, who had a daughter called Princess Nadeshiko. Her beauty surpassed all others. One spring during the third month, when the parents took their daughter to see the cherry blossoms at Enshō-ji, there was a hairdresser named Asagiri who fell in love with the princess. Unable to fulfill his love, he resented this and drowned himself at the base of this waterfall. Nearby stands a small hill called Kamuroyama (Hairdresser Mountain), which is said to be his burial mound. To the east, the old site of Enshō-ji also remains.

Shibuya Hachiman Shrine is located in Naka-Shibuya in the same area. It serves as the tutelary deity of this place. The festival is held on August 15th.

Principal Shrine Deity: Emperor Ōjin, one seat. (According to shrine records, this divine image was, in ancient times, temporarily enshrined by Kōbō Daishi at Kurama-dera in Yamashiro Province following an oracle from Usa Hachiman Shrine in Buzen Province, and later Shibuya Jirō Takashige took custody of it to serve as the divine body of this shrine. The image of Amida Nyorai, the honji-butsu, was carved by the Great Master Jikaku. When Ajari Enshō founded Tōfuku-ji, a traveling monk came and bestowed it upon him.)

Preface to the Record of Ancient and Modern Mathematical Methods

Numbers begin with one and end with nine. One is the ancestor of nine, and nine is the source of eighty-one. In ancient times, when Fu Xi succeeded Heaven and became king, he received the River Chart (Hetu) and drew the Eight Trigrams (Bagua). When Yu controlled the great flood, he was granted the Luo Book (Luoshu) and set it forth as law.

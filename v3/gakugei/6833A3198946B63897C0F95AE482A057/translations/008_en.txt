Gyōtoku Boat Landing

From the place called Gyōtoku Wharf at Koami-chō 3-chōme in Edo to this location, the boat route spans 3 ri and 8 chō. As a post station on the highway to Bōsō, it has inns, making it a prosperous place where travelers come and go incessantly. Particularly during the 1st, 5th, and 9th months, the number of pilgrims visiting Narita Fudō-son is extraordinary, and the bustling activity is beyond the ordinary.

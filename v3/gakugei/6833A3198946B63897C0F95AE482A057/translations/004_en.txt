Yugao Kannon Hall　Located about half a ri northwest from the ferry crossing at Niijuku, along the embankment of the Nakagawa River in a place called Iitsuka Village. The principal deity, Sho Kanzeon, is a golden statue said to be about five sun tall, but it is deeply concealed in the inner sanctuary and worship is not permitted. Separately, a wooden statue of Kannon carved by Great Master Jikaku is enshrined in front of the shrine. According to tradition, this land was once the fief of a manor official named Sekiguchi. 《Edo Sunago states that this land was the old site of the tomb of Muraoka Goro Taira no Yoshifumi, but there is no evidence for this》In ancient times, the Sekiguchi clan established shrines to Kumano Gongen and water deities at this location. 《These small shrines still exist today》In front of the shrine stand two trees side by side - an old pine and an enoki tree. In spring and summer their branches and leaves wither, while in autumn and winter they increase in green color, which people find strange. It is also said that light sometimes emanates from between these trees, or dragon lanterns can be seen hanging from their branches.

In Kanbun 8 (1668), year of the earth monkey, the Sekiguchi clan consulted with a local doctor named Fukaya and dug beneath these trees, obtaining one or two Buddhist implements. 《Fukaya was from Kishu province and was called Kihee. At that time there was an old woman of about seventy years of similar age. Living beside the shrine, the old man and woman were deeply faithful, devoted to Nichiren's teachings, and constantly chanted the Lotus Sutra without negligence》They said there must have been a famous temple at this location in ancient times, and finally on the sixth day of the sixth month of the same year, they respectfully dug further into this soil and

obtained one golden statue of Daihi (Great Compassion). 《Seven characters reading "Made in the second month of Kocho 2" were carved on the back of the Buddhist statue》They immediately moved it to Fukaya's house and temporarily enshrined it in a Buddhist altar. The features were dignified and truly surpassed the work of ordinary craftsmen. However, the night before, Fukaya, the old man, and old woman all received divine messages in dreams, making it seem all the more miraculous, so they finally opened this land, built a grass hall, and respectfully moved this sacred statue there.

Upon consideration, it is said that the statue of Yugao Kannon in the world appeared from within a bottle gourd, hence this name, or alternatively it is said to be the personal Buddha statue of Murasaki Shikibu. This differs from what is recorded in the origin story of this place. For what reason does it have the name Yugao? The source of this is unknown.

Sarumata　A village name to the north of Niijuku.
The Shinho-sho states: Shimosa Province, Kasai
Sarumata Imperial Kitchen　180 cho　New Imperial Kitchen exists, etc.

In the Hojo family's domain register from Eiroku 2, it states that a person called Kubodera Okuranosho held land worth 49 kan-mon in Kasai Sarumata. Although Kasai now belongs to Musashi Province, in ancient times it was Shimosa Province. All ancient records show it thus.

Wado Temple Ruins　Located in the same place. It was an ancient Shingon temple called Bussho-san, said to have been founded during the Wado era. The temple buildings were magnificent until medieval times, but during the Battle of Konodai in Tenbun 6, they were reduced to ashes by military fires.

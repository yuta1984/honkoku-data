Man'yōshū - Poem composed when passing the grave of the maiden of Mama in Katsushika - Yamabe no Sukune Akahito
"Though I hear that here lies the tomb of Tekona of Mama in Katsushika, where people of old would have untied their woven sashes and built huts to court wives - do the leaves of sacred trees grow thick? Do the pine roots endure long? I cannot forget even her name alone, her memory alone."

Response poem
"I too have seen it, and will tell others - the burial place of Tekona of Mama in Katsushika"

Poem about the maiden of Mama in Katsushika　　　　Takahashi no Muraji Mushimaro
"In the land of the east where roosters crow, the story that existed in ancient times continues to be told without cease until today - Tekona of Mama in Katsushika, wearing hemp clothing with a blue jacket, weaving and wearing a straight-hanging skirt, not even combing her tangled hair, going without even wearing shoes - could even a sacred child wrapped in brocade and silk compare to this beloved?"

hanging. Below the double rafters, at the bracket arms, golden dragons and white dragons are carved out, and between each there are several lions of plain wood.
The horizontal beams and wood surfaces all have peony and arabesque carvings. The twelve pillars are all zelkova
plain wood round pillars, finished in Chinese wood coloring, with diamond-patterned ground designs containing circular windows, inside which are
carvings of birds, animals, plants and flowers. The front gable has round carvings of golden dragons, and the imperial plaque is
said to be the imperial calligraphy of Retired Emperor Go-Mizunoo after his abdication.
The characters of the divine name are in gold, and the rest is filled with ultramarine blue. The balustrade handrails are
black lacquered with gold-plated metal fittings, and between the balustrades are round carvings of Chinese children at play. The upper and lower eave areas have
one golden dragon carving every three shaku interval, and along the upper lintel are carvings of
human figures or birds and animals. Some depict the four arts (music, go, calligraphy, painting), and the human figures include Duke of Zhou, Confucius, Yan Hui, Lu Ao, Fei Changfang, Qin Gao,
Ji Kang, Ruan Ji, Fenggan, Wang Ziyou, the Three Laughers of Tiger Creek, the Four Friends, the Nine Worthies, etc. On the left and right of the front are extremely

the same on both left and right. On the back left and right are two golden lions each. Golden bells hang at
the four corners of the gate's high eaves. Now, from this gate onward, based on preliminary sketches by Morinobu and Yasunobu, skilled
carvers have carved these works, making them carvings unparalleled in the world. It is impossible to enumerate them all
completely, and since it would not be appropriate to know them in great detail, and since everything inside the Chinese gate is
too sacred to describe, only a rough outline is recorded here. The rest can be inferred accordingly.
Chinese Gate　Directly facing the Yomei Gate. Four-sided ridge with Chinese gable construction. On the roof ridge above the front gable
is something made of Chinese bronze that the common people call a "tsutsunga" insect. Its
form has four limbs and resembles a tiger. About four shaku long, it is bound with chains. Also, on the east
and west ridges are two dragons, also of Chinese bronze, probably over four shaku long. The gate is made of Chinese wood, and on the front

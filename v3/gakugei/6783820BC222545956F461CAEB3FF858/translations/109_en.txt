He made a vow and prayed for the eastward transmission of Buddhism, and upon his return to Japan, he established a shrine at Daigo, revering it as a guardian deity of Buddhism and enshrining it as Seiryū Gongen. This was the beginning. At our mountain too, during the Kōnin era, the monk Kūkai climbed the mountain and established shrines at Takino-o and Jakkō, transmitting both the exoteric and esoteric teachings of the Old Shingon school. It is said that this shrine was established by his followers, who invited the deity from Daigo for the protection of Buddhism.

West Town: Also called Iri-machi (Entrance Town). These are the towns located west of the sacred mountain precincts: Shiken-chō, Hara-machi, Fukuro-machi, Hon-machi (Upper, Middle, Lower), Daiku-chō (Upper, Middle, Lower), and Itahiki-machi. These towns are divided into districts both lengthwise and crosswise, with shops lining both sides of the streets in continuous rows.

Kyōdai-chigiri (Brotherhood Pact): From the east at Matsubara-machi to the west at Nishi-machi, townspeople and others, starting from around the third month's Jōshi festival, begin with picking young herbs, sometimes calling it flower viewing, inviting close friends to seek flowers in mountains and fields, spreading flower mats, carrying food and drink, playing the shamisen, beating drums, singing and dancing for entertainment as a local custom, which they call

"Brotherhood Pact," ending on the eighth day of the fourth month.

Jōkō-ji Temple: Located in Itahiki-machi, it is called Kangen-san Myōkaku-in. This temple was originally at Hotoke-iwa. Jōkō-ji was formerly called Jōkō-bō and was one of the attendant monks of Kōmyō-in, the head temple and chief priest of our mountain in ancient times. After Kōmyō-in was discontinued during the Ōei period in ancient times, it was moved to Zennyo-shin Valley. Also, what was called Ōjō-in was originally located near the Jizō Hall at Hotoke-iwa, serving as the cemetery for the entire mountain, displaying a plaque reading "Myōgaku-mon" by Master Kūkai. However, since this location corresponded to the demon gate (unlucky direction) of the mountain, it was decided by general consensus to move it to Zennyo-shin Valley. Later, in the tenth month of Kanei 17, both Ōjō-in and the quarters of the six attendant monks were moved to the west of Watauchi Village (the present location), as recorded in old documents. The former site of Ōjō-in is now the Amida Hall of Jōkō-ji, and the site of the six attendants' Jōkō-bō is precisely Jōkō-ji. Therefore, Ōjō-in and Jōkō-bō have now been combined and are called Jōkō-ji. Since Jōkō-bō was formerly one of the six attendants, its legacy name remains, and even today the local people call Jōkō-ji "Rokugu" (Six Attendants). Now, regarding the historically transmitted Kōmyō-in...

Not to mention something like the five scrolls of Emperor Go-Mizunoo's imperial calligraphy—ordinary people have never had the opportunity to see or hear of them.
However, among the clergy there is a learned monk who takes pity on my antiquarian obsession, and in our daily intimate conversations, he directly explains in detail the essential meanings of secret texts and the contents of ancient records.
Ah, this must be said to be the divine spirits of Mount Kōgaku secretly protecting my sincere heart.
How could I not be moved to gratitude? Is this not also a great joy? Through this, everything in my collection—even the smallest historical episode—flows entirely from these clear and reliable ancient records, with nothing left to personal speculation. The only lamentable thing about my ignorance is that, as they say, if one hears but does not truly listen, I may have often misunderstood stories of utmost importance.

One: A common saying goes: "Until you have seen Nikkō, you should not speak of magnificence." Ah, what a maxim! Regarding this saying, I too once made a statement and lamented:
"Since the divine mausoleum's construction was first completed, there have been no temple buildings in all the land." Indeed, it's not that there are no temple buildings,

but rather that there are no temple buildings like those of Nikkō. Indeed,
the magnificence within Tōshōgū is such that every inch exhausts the art of carving, the gold and jewels
pierce the eye, and the miraculous craftsmanship dissolves the soul. It should be said that the Golden Realm, Silver Realm, and Purple Celestial Spirit Palace are all gathered here in great completion. Even to record the painted decorations of a single beam or pillar, if I were to detail its special design,
even the brush would refuse, saying it cannot bear it, and Master Paper would plead for mercy. Therefore, I now record only the locations of the golden halls and
jade towers and the general outline of their magnificent appearance, without describing their construction in detail.

One: Things like the延年 Eastern Dances, Archery Festival, Fire-Calming Festival, Mountain Asceticism and Meditation, Tōtoko Dance, and Forced Rice Ceremony have been
the deepest secrets of their respective traditions since ancient times, so they should not be easily recorded. However,
since they exist in popular oral tradition and are constantly witnessed by people, I also cannot
completely omit recording them. Therefore, I merely mention these items without clearly
explaining their origins. This is not only because I fear the sin of rashness, but because
the deeply secret ancient practices cannot be glimpsed or heard about. Gentlemen who peruse this work, please maintain a respectful distance

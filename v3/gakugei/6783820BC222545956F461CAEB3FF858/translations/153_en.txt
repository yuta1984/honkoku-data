It is said to also be called Raijin Cave (Thunder God Cave) because it is a den where beasts that fly through the void like thunder dwell.
If so, it would be the dwelling place of what the world calls Nikko Thunder. Also according to tradition, there was once a Shinto priest who governed this cave, but now that lineage has ended and his descendants became court musicians at the shrine.
Therefore, when I consider it, what the ancient origin records state - "There was a rock cave in this mountain from which great winds blew out twice each in spring and autumn, causing such devastation that the common people suffered greatly, so Kōbō Daishi climbed the mountain and performed purification and established sacred boundaries around that cave" - this must refer to this cavern. In connection with this, the explanation of the mountain's name "Nikō" was given in the previous volume.

Misawa Tea House: Since this is where one gradually climbs up the riverbed path from Umagaeshi, crossing scaffolded walkways or dangerous bridges built over rapids before ascending the mountain path, a tea shop has been established. From around April to August, people come here to live and serve as a resting place for monks and laypeople making pilgrimages, selling tea and crude sweets. Though the mountain path is steep, one can climb even by palanquin, but since cattle and horses are prohibited, rice and other miscellaneous goods for Chūzenji Temple and Yumoto hot springs

are all carried up on people's backs daily.

Jizō Hall: This is also called Misawa Jizō Hall. This place serves as the boundary for the prohibition of killing living beings and the sacred barrier forbidding women, cattle and horses. Local people also call it Misawa Women's Hall. That this was named the Eastern Gate of Chūzenji is mentioned in the origin records, with the reasoning that it is called Dhyāna-pāramitā.

Sword Peak: This place is the most perilous and dangerous part of the Chūzenji path, where the route seems about to be cut off, so scaffolded walkways have been built to facilitate passage. It is called this in comparison to the danger of crossing over a sword blade.

Hōdō Waterfall: This area is a deep valley where steep mountains rise in countless layers. A waterfall flows down from the deep ravines to the north. Viewing it from a distance, the waterfall is about three feet wide and four to five jō high.

Hannya Waterfall: This is also in the same location, falling from the southwestern mountain valley. The waterfall is eight to nine feet wide and about three to four jō high. Its water force is much greater than Hōdō Waterfall. The origins of these two waterfalls' names are recorded in the section on Kegon Falls.

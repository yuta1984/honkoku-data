It is said that the monk-archbishop Kōkai developed this place, and that the entire mountain community of monks practiced here, as can be seen in the old records.
In the high place to the southwest, there are several hundred seated stone Amida Buddha statues, each about three feet tall, arranged in rows. From this area, following the riverbank for about one chō and climbing up steep rocks, there is a bone pagoda by the riverbank.

Bone Repository Pagoda: The foundation stone is large, perhaps four or five tatami mats in size, with holes carved into the stone for the purpose of storing bones. A stone stele with inscriptions has been erected on top of it. The inscription was composed by Hayashi Razan.
　　　　Ganman-buchi Bone Repository Hall Stele　　　　　　　　Composed by Razan Hayashi Dōshun

There is a deep pool in Mount Nikkō. It is said to be the place where Fudō Myōō appeared. Therefore, taking that seed syllable, it is called Ganman-buchi.
Truly this is a sacred and spiritual place. Previously,
there was a bone hall in the deep recesses behind Tōshōgū Shrine. The Great Master Jigen, fearing the divine authority, had it destroyed. Later, the Great Master's final teaching said: "After my death, this hall should be rebuilt." There was no time to select a suitable location, and several years gradually passed. Just now,
the Venerable Prince Sonkei has indicated that a hall can be built in the secluded area of Ganman-buchi. Moreover, the Great Master's disciples,

for the sake of all past spirits and their own enlightenment, carved several stone Jizō statues and erected them on the bank of the pool.

It is hoped that through this merit, the bones will become crystal or jewels, or share bones with Fudō and Jizō, or extract fruit to be united with Buddha's relics. If the bones are already thus, then those spirits may ascend to heaven or attain Buddhahood, which can be verified.
The Prince continues the Great Master's aspiration and receives the Great Master's tradition in making this undertaking. Is it not fitting to store ten thousand bones? Burying dried bones is the virtue of a sage ruler, and covering bones and burying corpses is the governmental decree of early spring. This is not my personal opinion, but I mention it briefly.

As a result, many trees withered and were lost.

Mount Ogura: A low mountain continuing eastward from the tea pavilion, with several pine trees lining the peak. Pine trees also flourish around the tea house on all sides, and grass grows thick.

Kirifuri Falls: Passing through the foot of Mount Ogura, going up and down through the northern mountain valleys for about one ri and more to reach the mountain top, then descending about one chō down a slope path to view the waterfall that cascades down. The water spray flying down from the mountain top, which appears to be fifty to sixty ken high, strikes against multiple tiers of rocks and scatters like smoke and mist, hence the name "Kirifuri" (mist-falling) arose. Recently, when the Shogun made his pilgrimage, considering that he might also view this waterfall during his tour, all the trees around the waterfall were cleared away, so the multi-tiered cascade from the mountain top can be seen completely. The illustration is shown next.

Ikuoka Dainichi Hall: On the roadside west of Shichiri Village along the highway, there is a small slope with a stone monument inscribed "Ikuoka Dainichi Road." Turning left from that spot and climbing the slope path leads to hilly terrain. This is the land of Uwano Village, and the area around Dainichi Hall is likely a hamlet called Ikuoka within the village. Therefore, the local people call it either "Uwano no Dainichi" or "Ikuoka no Dainichi."

The grounds of Dainichi at this location are entirely covered with an ancient cedar forest. At the entrance to the temple grounds, there are seven or eight trees in a row on the left side, all with a girth of more than one jō. On the right side, ancient cherry trees stand in a line. About six or seven ken toward Dainichi Hall stands the hall, which is about three ken square with a worship hall attached. The principal image is said to be the work of Kōbō Daishi.

Behind the hall, adjacent to it, stand seven large old cedar trees. Two or three of them are particularly large trees, with a circumference of about one jō and eight or nine shaku. The way their branches and leaves droop to the ground is curved and resembles old pine trees. In front of the temple grounds is flat farmland, with rice fields continuing to the area of Sannō Forest in the neighboring village of Noguchi. According to tradition, in ancient times this Dainichi and the Sannō shrine were also sites of prosperity, with several bettō-sho (head temples) and other temple buildings.

Record of the Sacred Enshrinement (by Minister Karasumaru Fujiwara no Mitsuhiro)
　In the third year of Genna (1617), the sacred body was transferred to Mount Nikko, following the precedent when the Great Crown (Fujiwara no Kamatari) was moved from Mount Ai in Settsu Province to Tōnomine by the monk Jōe.
　This was done because the sacred spirit continues the same lineage. Even Amaterasu Ōmikami was later enshrined at Isuzu River by Yamato-hime no Mikoto. The deity of Otokoyama was made to dwell in the three robes of that monk by Gyōkyō from Usa Shrine. On this occasion, the circumstances were more detailed than during his lifetime, and through a divine covenant with Great Monk Tenkei, he is guided so closely before us, which must surely be viewed with great joy. This principle remains unchanged from ancient times to the present.

　Bell Inscription of Great Master Jigen《With Preface》
　The mausoleum of Great Master Jigen, the venerable Tenkai who restored the Tendai teachings at Mount Nikkō,
　was constructed by the imperial command of Shogun Iemitsu,
　Junior First Rank, Minister of the Left, Minamoto no Ason. This Buddhist chamber is named Kenshōin. Disciple Kōkai, wishing to express gratitude for his master's virtue,
　cast this bronze bell to serve for morning and evening awakening. Humbly we pray that the realm be peaceful, the people
　secure, Buddhist teachings widely spread, and all spirits equally benefited. The inscription reads:
　Nikkō's sacred peaks　Magnificent scenery grand　Mountains, rivers, secluded valleys　Almost resembling the moon realm　Three Buddhas stand in pagodas
　Myriad deities line the halls　Majestic golden halls　Splendid painted eaves　Restored ancestral shrine　Virtuous ocean boundless
　Crushing evil, revealing truth　Thus we name this master　Golden cast temple bell　Hanging high above　One strike sets in motion
　The sound's benefit most great　Extending benefit to three realms　Awakening the four directions　Subduing demons and heretics　Destroying evil spirits
　Dissolving poisoned swords　The Tang emperor escapes calamity　Ruler and ministers in harmony　The nation peaceful　Buddhist teachings flourishing
　Eternal blessings

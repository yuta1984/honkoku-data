[The Prince] bestowed [this poem]:
Even so, due to this unexpected temporary sleep, tonight perhaps this mountain village is like the moon over the capital
[Someone] replied immediately:
Adding the radiance of words to the moon we see, let it remind us of the autumn in the capital
The old and young of the entire mountain held a banquet, and several young acolytes gathered to perform various musical pieces.
After the banquet ended, a young man called Fujiotomaro came to the resting place to pay his respects, and after talking for a while, he returned home. The next day he sent this message:
"That which was spoken of by reputation—who would know the devotion of heart from having met face to face?"
Fujiotomaro's reply:
"What we saw in meeting—was it but a dream I wonder—these words bring me back to reality"
Another night, that same acolyte visited again, saying he was drawn by the exceptional beauty of the moon, and after talking for a while, he earnestly requested that [I] compose a poem

So I composed this impromptu verse:
"Gazing at the moon, if we should remember, would the empty sky become our memento together?"
Since this was to be our last night or two together, we played without noticing how late it grew,
but when the bell of the fifth watch had already sounded, he returned home and sent this poem through a messenger from Nagato:
"What shall I do? Even if this body has hope for the future, how can autumn's parting be taken lightly?"
My reply:
"There is a time when I too shall vanish like dew on the path of parting—why must people lament so much about autumn?"
A poem sent along with it:
"How could I forget? Even if people think of it as merely a temporary pillow of one night's dream"

Gōhan (Forced Rice): This is the traditional gōhan ceremony of our mountain. It is commonly called "Nikkō-zeme" (Nikkō torture), and at various sub-temples, several implements for Nikkō-zeme are hung and arranged. Twisting sticks or large tobacco pipes are set up.

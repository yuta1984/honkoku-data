　After the bridge was established for the convenience of passage, merchant houses came to line the area and the streetscape was developed. Also, according to what I heard from village elders, the area above Kami-Hatsuishi slope was originally part of a mountain continuing from the peak of Hoshi-no-miya, but the entire mid-slope from Sakaguchi to Geba Bridge was cut and leveled to create a townscape built on the middle tier. The northern back area of what is now called Naka-Hatsuishi was very narrow because it pressed right up to the water's edge of the Daiya River near the townhouses. That riverbed was filled with earth and stones from opening up the mountainside, and the river course was excavated toward the foot of Mount Ogura, so now the river runs close to the north bank, and the north back street from Naka-Hatsuishi to Shimo-Hatsuishi has become a level thoroughfare. However, since it was originally a riverbed site, many large stones still lie scattered along the roadside.
　The success of this assistance work was commanded to the Sendai domain, and their achievements were also considerable.
　Since ancient times, passage to the mountain precincts went from in front of Kannon Temple, past what is now called the meeting place, out to the riverbed to cross the Daiya River, and reached the mountain precincts from below the main shrine.

Imaichi post station was established after the御打入 (lord's entry), and originally people crossed the Daiya River at Shichiri village, crossed the Kinu River at Ōwatari to reach Utsunomiya, and the routes to Nasu and to Aizu remain the same from ancient times to now.
　The Sōchō Kikō states: 《Eishō 6, 9th month》From this Yashima, traveling together to a place called Kanuma, there is the residence of Tsunafusa's《who is Mibu Nakatsukasa-shōyū》father, Chikugo-no-kami Tsunashige.
　　Staying one night in the urgency of departure
　　　　　　Without parting, I visit - autumn frost on Kurokami Mountain
　The same travel record states: The road from Kanuma to the temple is fifty ri. With the recent rains, I thought neither people nor horses could possibly travel, but people came out to meet us from various places all the way to the temple's Sakamoto - this was extraordinary. The houses of Sakamoto continue without number and appear to be a blessed land. From here

When journeying to Mount Potalaka, these two disciples accompanied him, and according to their family names, Saint Shōdō and Kyōmin were cousins. Therefore, Saint Shōdō is the founder and Kyōmin is called the originating patriarch of our mountain, serving as the first head abbot. The Jinja-kō records that Utsunomiya Kōtsuna was supposedly the eighteenth-generation descendant of Abbot Kyōmin, but there is no reliable source for this. Both Shōdō and Kyōmin bore the Ōnakatomi surname, while the Utsunomiya family descended from the Fujiwara clan, originating from Abbot Sōen, who was the great-great-grandson of Awadaguchi Chancellor Michikane, and from Munetsuna who established the family line to Kōtsuna spans approximately nine generations. This is what appears in the genealogical records. The theory in Jinja-kō is probably erroneous.

Buddha Rock: Continuing from the eastern valley, there are temple buildings and monks' quarters. Buddha Rock refers to three or four rocks resembling Buddhist statues that stood side by side at the mountain's edge, but due to an ancient landslide, the original Buddha Rocks were lost. However, it has remained as a place name since ancient times. From here is the main road to Takino-o, and it is about eight chō (approximately 870 meters) of flat terrain gradually ascending to the shrine precincts, with stone paving continuing all the way to the shrine grounds.

Kaizan Hall: Also called Jizō Hall. Six ken square with four sides, painted red, with windows in each section and doors on all four sides. Built in hōgyō style facing east. The principal image is a wooden seated Jizō statue about five shaku tall, made by Unkei. Inside the hall hangs a plaque reading "Kaisen-in," written by His Imperial Highness Prince Kōdō, the head abbot. On the stone floor is a Buddhist altar with a tabernacle containing a portrait statue of Saint Shōdō, with statues of his ten disciples placed on either side. Since the saint was a reincarnation of Jizō Bodhisattva, Jizō is enshrined here. This place is where the saint was cremated.

The Buddhist records state: "The monk Shōdō. His family name was Wakata. A person from Haga District, Shimotsuke Province. He early transcended worldly attachments and aspired to supreme achievement. In the province there was Mount Potalaka. Its peaks towered majestically, and since ancient times no one had climbed it. In the fourth month of Jingo-keiun 1 (767), Dō attempted the ascent. The path was treacherous, the snow deep, and clouds and mist obscured the way so that he could not climb. He remained on the mountainside for approximately twenty-one days before returning. In Tennō 1 (781), in early summer, he again took up his former aspiration. He was again forced to retreat. At the beginning of Enryaku (782), in the third month, he made a great vow and applied himself to diligent practice.

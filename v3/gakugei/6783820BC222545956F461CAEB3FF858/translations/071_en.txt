The procession departure (togyo) takes place at the hour of the Sheep (around 2 PM) on the twenty-eighth day of the second month, and the return (kangyo) occurs at the hour of the Horse (around noon) on the first day of the third month.
On that occasion, the shrine attendants (shinjin) serve in attendance, placing the portable shrine in the worship hall, and on the following second day, the portable shrine proceeds to the main shrine.

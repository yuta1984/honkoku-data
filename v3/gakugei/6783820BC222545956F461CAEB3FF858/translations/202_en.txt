Standing independently to the west, it is entirely a stone mountain where trees do not grow at all. Climbing up and down from the summit of Mae-Shirane, it is another ri (league) to ascend. It is truly a sacred mountain, and only what is called "nigamomo" (bitter peach) grows thickly in patches among the rocks. It blooms in spring and bears fruit in summer. The size is smaller than beans, red in color when ripe. Red-crowned cranes favor these, and when they ripen, flocks come to eat the fruit. For this reason, nigamomo is a fruit favored by cranes, so it is said to be a medicinal product that can preserve longevity. At the summit there is a shrine dedicated to Nikko Gongen. Here it is revered as Shirane Gongen. The shrine is made of bronze, with an inscription of dedication from the first year of Jōō (1652). This mountaintop erupted in the second year of Keian (1649), and the tremors continued for days without stopping. The head priest of our mountain commanded that Hakkō (eight lectures) religious practices be performed at the Shingu worship hall, or had the Myōten (Lotus Sutra) recited. At that time, the summit burst open from the eruption, volcanic ash accumulated two to three shaku deep around Akanuma Plain, and it also fell on Jōshū and Aizu domains. The place that burst open became a rock cave about two chō wide, with a depth of unknown tens of jō. The stone shrine that had been there since ancient times also fell into the cave at this time.

Therefore, it was made of bronze and dedicated. Now, this peak is on the border between Kōzuke and Shimotsuke provinces, and there is a shrine at what appears to be the eighth-tenth mark on the Jōshū side. This is the land of Kōzuke Province, where it is revered and worshipped as Arayama Gongen, and as the tutelary deity. Since sericulture is their main occupation every year, each household brings new silk taken from cocoons when visiting, and from each shrine they tie together what looks like shimenawa (sacred ropes) stretching down to the foot of the mountain. The number is so great that it cannot be determined, and when viewed from afar, it looks like cloth stretched out. The deity enshrined is also the same as the tutelary god of our place, differing only in the shrine name, so I hear. Thus the steep peak is divided east and west, with the eastern side up to the summit being the land of our province (Shimotsuke), while from the eighth-tenth of the mountain westward is the land of that province (Kōzuke). This mountain serves as the boundary between the two provinces. Now, since the summit is high, it is always covered by clouds and mist, and because the north wind is strong, huge rocks are gathered and piled around the bronze shrine, making it appear as if the shrine were built inside a rock chamber. One can see in all directions. The local people say that Mount Shirane is...

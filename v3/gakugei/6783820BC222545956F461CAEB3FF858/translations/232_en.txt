Bell Tower　Located east of the Korean bell. Total height approximately 2 jō 5-6 shaku, base stone area approximately 3 ken square. The ends of the
rafters are all dragon heads with coloring, and the metal fittings are gold-plated.
Drum Tower　Located west of the Korean hanging lantern. Construction is the same as the bell tower.
Honji Hall　Located west of the drum tower. Large-scale construction, approximately 5 ken by 10 ken, copper-roofed, facing east with a worship hall of
4 ken by 7 ken. A temple gong is hung, with three doors in front, and the inner sanctuary approximately 4 ken by 7 ken. Above the rainbow beam of the worship hall
there is a tiger carving. The pillars are wrapped in gold brocade, as are the upper horizontal beams, with ground patterns in color and gold and silver inlaid.
The double rafters are lacquered black with gold-plated metal fittings. On the ceiling of the inner sanctuary is an ink
painting of a coiling dragon 8 ken long, painted by Kano Eishin Yasunobu. The sacred statue enshrined in the hall is said to
model the Yakushi of Sanshu Peak. To the left and right are enshrined Nikko, Gakko, the Twelve Divine Generals, the Four Heavenly Kings, Aizen Myoo, Thousand-
armed Kannon, and Nyoirin Kannon.
Yomei Gate　Facing south-southwest. Due to the rafter divisions and bay count, it is difficult to know precisely, but it is approximately 4 ken by 2 ken
or so. Three-bracket construction, Chinese gables on four sides, copper-roofed. Large golden bells at the eaves on all four sides

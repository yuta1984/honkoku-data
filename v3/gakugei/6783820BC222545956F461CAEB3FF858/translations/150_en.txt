The Kannon (Kiyotaki Kannon) in the vicinity is a six-by-four-ken structure with a worship hall. The principal image of Kannon is said to be a Thousand-Armed Bodhisattva created from leftover wood when the monk Shōdō carved the Thousand-Armed Kannon of Chūzenji Temple. The Kannon of Chūzenji Temple is the 18th temple of the Bandō pilgrimage circuit, but since it is on a mountain forbidden to women, this image was installed here as a substitute, allowing female pilgrims to offer their prayer slips at this Kiyotaki Kannon Hall. According to one theory, when Kōbō Daishi established Kiyotaki Gongen, he installed a Thousand-Armed Bodhisattva above the waterfall of Mount Jūzen, and this location was modeled after that, enshrining Kiyotaki Gongen and establishing the Thousand-Armed Bodhisattva at that time as well.

Ashio Road: Going a little through Kiyotaki Village, the Chūzenji road turns right while the Ashio road heads left. Beyond that is a small village called Hosoo. There are houses that accommodate travelers from Jōshū Province and other pilgrims who come to this mountain via Myōgi and Haruna to Ashio when they are caught by nightfall on the mountain paths. From here, one crosses two ri of treacherous roads over Ashio Pass.

Umagaeshi Village: This is a hamlet name within Hosoo Village. This area is quite deep in the mountains,

with extremely narrow and confined terrain. Although called a village, only eight or nine households reside there. There is little arable land, and they cultivate between large stones and strange rocks as farmland. Both men and women make mountain work their livelihood, and women also wear short garments, making it quite difficult to distinguish between men and women by their working appearance. However, this was in the past, and things have changed from twenty or thirty years ago. The house construction has improved, and there are three or four tea shops lined up along the road, selling food and drink sufficient to feed travelers. The customs and people, even in this mountain setting, are not particularly rustic or unsophisticated.

Mount Mae-Nikkō and Wind Cave: From Umagaeshi, traveling four or five chō along the riverbed road to the right of the highway, steep rocks form cliffs of several dozen jō with two mountains standing side by side. Since they are smaller versions of Nantai and Nyohō peaks, they are called Mae-Nikkō or Shō-Nikkō. On these steep cliffs is a cave, not accessible by human paths. Measuring the cave's dimensions from the distant foothills, it appears about one jō high and six to seven shaku wide. Its depth is unknown. Wind emerges from this cave, and it is said that raijū (thunder beasts) riding on clouds

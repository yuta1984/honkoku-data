Of these, twenty-four people practiced the rituals of the Lotus Samādhi, while twelve people received the rituals of the Constant Practice Samādhi and practiced without negligence. Therefore, the Kamakura Right General (Minamoto no Yoritomo) had faith in them, and in September of the second year of Bunji, he donated fifteen chō of land in Samukawa District of the same province as lamp oil funds for the Constant Practice Samādhi training, as recorded in the Azuma Kagami. The Right Minister Sanetomo also had faith, and both Shogun houses donated crystal prayer beads and other items to this hall, so it was also called Yoritomo-dō from ancient times. However, in April of the third year of Genna, when the land was being prepared for the construction of palace buildings due to the enshrinement of the divine spirit of Tōshōgū, a copper vessel was excavated from beneath the great cedar in front of the Niō Gate. When it was presented to the Dai-sōjō, he thought it strange and removed the lid to look inside, finding a lapis lazuli jar. Believing this to be the bones of Lord Yoritomo, and saying that ancient records documented this matter, he immediately entrusted it to Gyōe Hōin of Dairakuin, the founding head priest of the shrine. Later, during the time of the second-generation Ekai Hōin, by order of Kōkai Sōjō of Bishamondō, that lapis lazuli jar was enclosed in an iron treasure pagoda and placed in Jōgyō Samādhi Hall.

Ashio Pass: One ri each for ascent and descent. Toward Nikko, descend northeast to reach Hosoo village, then pass through Kiyotaki village to reach Nikko shrine precincts - a journey of over 2 ri. At the summit there is always one tea house. Descending southwest, there is a mountain village called Watarase belonging to Shinnashi village of Ashio-go. A valley stream springs from the ravines south of Lake Chuzenji and flows out from the Watarase area, hence it is called Watarase River until it flows south to join the Tone River. Cross this river at the bottom of the pass - 2 ri to Ashio village, 3 ri from the pass.

He descended and governed all necessary matters with great beauty and order, and the people all followed like grass bending in the wind. Afterward, when barbarian rebels from various provinces continued to rebel, he raised armies to subdue them, so that even the regional leaders offered up the territories they had controlled and followed his commands. The entire eastern region became peaceful, and his descendants governed for many generations. This is recorded in the Chronicles of Japan (Nihongi). From then through successive imperial reigns until the reign at Naniwa Takatsu Palace (Emperor Nintoku, the 17th human emperor), Kenu Province was divided into upper and lower parts, named Kamitsuke Province and Shimotsuke Province. Narawake-no-miko, the great-great-grandson of Prince Toyokiiri-hiko, was appointed as the first provincial governor (kokuzō). Thus it became the independent province called Shimotsuke Province. From Emperor Sujin's reign to Emperor Nintoku's reign, approximately four hundred years had passed. The government office that Provincial Governor Narawake-no-miko established was probably the provincial capital (kokufu) of this district. According to one theory, what is called Tsuga District originally had ancient burial mounds (tsuka), so it was formerly written as Tsuka District.

According to the Wadō imperial edict stating that the names of provinces, districts, villages, and hamlets should use auspicious characters and be fixed at two characters, the provincial name also dropped the character "ke" to become Kōzuke Province and Shimotsuke Province, and the district name was also changed from "tsuka" (mound) to "Tsuga District." The two provinces of Kamitsuke and Shimotsuke had descendants of Prince Toyokiiri-hiko residing in these provinces since ancient times, with his descendants permanently becoming local people. Their offspring multiplied throughout the provinces, beginning with those who took the names Kamitsukeno-no-asomi and Shimotsukeno-no-asomi, and others who became ancestors of the Mibu clan, as recorded in the Shinsen Shōjiroku (New Compilation of the Register of Families). Also recorded in the Jinmyōchō (Register of Deities) is Nikōzan Shrine (Myōjin-taisha class). The mountain name "Nikō" is read in Japanese pronunciation as "Futaara-yama." The origin of why it is called Mount Nikō can be found in the old records of this temple: since ancient times, there has been a great cave to the northeast of Chūzen-ji Temple, which is called Rasetsu-kutsu (Demon Cave). Though this great cave has existed since ancient times, it is said that it was named during the time of the founding priest. From within this cave, great winds blow out twice yearly in spring and autumn, toppling vegetation, destroying people's houses, and ravaging the entire province in a regular pattern.

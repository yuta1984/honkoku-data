Who could gaze upon the monk Shōdō's bamboo integrity and pine virtue (pure moral conduct and noble character), chant his enlightenment, take refuge in Dharma, worship Kannon, and follow the path of Shakyamuni? Entering the steep mountains, leaping like a towering dragon, crossing precipices, and soaring like a phoenix through the passage. Protected by the divine power, when surveying the mountains and rivers, the mountain colors rise majestically, and the water colors are clear and deep. The beautiful flowers shine brilliantly, and exotic birds sing sweetly. The earthly and heavenly sounds resonate like zither and koto music, and extraordinary beings bathe in music that sometimes rings out. At a glance, worries disappear and a hundred troubles naturally cease. Nothing in the human world compares, and nothing in heaven can match it. It is natural that Sun Xing casts his divining sticks and Guo Ci circles around. Alas, fellow seekers, why not leisurely wander in the Kōnin era, in the Dunchang month, on the thirtieth day of the strong new moon, the day of Mizunoto-Tori? Human understanding does not necessarily require face-to-face meeting; if one speaks long, minds connect, creating an encounter of instant friendship. Though Master Dō and I were born in different years and have never met, fortunately through Master I, I heard of his refined sensibilities and was additionally requested to write a record of Mount Raku. Though I am untalented, I dare not decline when duty calls, and have drawn forth humble words to write upon silk. Both my words and calligraphy are weak, and though I deeply fear the profound yet remain simple, I offer these fragments to express the sincerity of my feelings, hoping not to forget our mutual remembrance even a hundred years hence.

Private Record of Chūzenji Temple
　Nikkō-san Manganji Temple: During the reign of Empress Shōtoku, in the Jingo-keiun era, a person from Haga District of this province, the monk Shōdō, diligently sought the Buddha Way, climbed to the sacred cave, and for the protection of the nation and benefit of all beings, petitioned the deities, copied Buddhist sutras, and first established this mountain as a site to create a new temple. In the center of this mountain is a peak whose height is unknown—perhaps thousands of fathoms. On the halfway slope of this peak is a great monastery called Chūzenji, where a jōroku (life-size) Thousand-Armed Kannon statue is enshrined. Beside it, a sacred shrine was built to venerate the gongen (avatar deity), and one thousand copies of the Lotus Sutra together with six hundred scrolls of the Great Prajñāpāramitā Sutra were stored in boxes and placed in the hall. Every year on the twenty-second and twenty-third days of the fourth month, during both morning services, a great assembly is held. On the first day the Prajñāpāramitā Sutra is lectured, on the next day the Lotus Sutra is lectured, and thirty-three trays of sacred food are prepared and offered to Avalokiteshvara.

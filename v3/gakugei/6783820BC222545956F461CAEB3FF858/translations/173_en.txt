　Carrying Buddhist sutras and images to the mountain base, he read sutras and worshipped Buddha for seven days and nights, then made a firm vow: "If the gods and spirits have divine power, I pray they will perceive my heart. The sutras and images I have copied and drawn should reach the mountaintop to serve as offerings to the gods, thereby revering divine majesty and bringing abundant blessings to all living beings. I humbly pray that benevolent spirits will lend their power, have poisonous dragons raise mist, and mountain spirits lead the way to help fulfill my wish. If I do not reach the summit, neither shall I attain enlightenment." Having made this vow, he crossed over brilliant white snow and climbed through glittering green leaves. Halfway up, his body grew weary and his strength exhausted. After resting overnight, he finally saw the peak. In a dazed state between dream and waking, without riding any vehicle he suddenly entered the Milky Way, and without tasting any miraculous medicine he was able to see the sacred cavern. Between joy and sorrow, his spirit was difficult to contain. As for the mountain's form: dragons lie dormant from east to west with no visible end, while tigers crouch from north to south in restful majesty. He pointed to Mount Myōkō as a companion and drew the iron wheel as a belt, laughing at Mount Heng and Dai as still lowly, and sneering at Kunlun and Xiang as inferior. The sun rises first in brightness, the moon comes and sets late. Without borrowing heaven's eye, ten thousand ri stretch before one's eyes—why need one ride a crane? White clouds lie beneath one's feet, myriad brocade flowers weave constantly without mechanism, and who could craft the hundred kinds of spiritual beings? Looking north there is a lake of approximately one hundred

　chō in area, narrow from east to west and long from north to south. Looking west there is also a small lake, totaling over twenty chō. Looking southwest there is furthermore a great lake of approximately over one thousand chō in circumference, not wide from east to west but extending far from north to south. The high peaks on all four sides cast inverted reflections in the water, with a hundred kinds of extraordinary scenes where trees and rocks exist freely. Silver snow spreads on the ground, golden flowers bloom on branches. The lake mirror shows no favoritism—what among myriad colors could escape? Mountains and water reflect each other, and at first glance it breaks one's heart. While gazing with unsatisfied eyes, wind and snow drove him on, so he built a small hermitage at the southwestern corner and lived there, performing ritual repentance and diligently reading sutras for twenty-one days. Having fulfilled his vow, he returned to his former dwelling. After leaving in late March of Enryaku 3 (784), he ascended again, taking five days to reach the shores of that southern lake. In early April, he managed to build a small boat two jō long and three feet wide, and immediately went with two or three disciples to pole around the lake for sightseeing. Looking around at the four walls, the divine beauty was abundant. Looking east and west, he drifted freely in leisurely pleasure. As evening came and his enthusiasm remained high, he forced himself to land on the southern island. This island was located over thirty jō from the shore and was the most beautifully adorned among all the islands. He then further toured the western lake, located about fifteen ri from the eastern lake, and also viewed the northern lake, located about thirty ri from the southern lake. Although all were thoroughly beautiful, none compared to the southern one. The southern lake had emerald water clear as a mirror, deep and

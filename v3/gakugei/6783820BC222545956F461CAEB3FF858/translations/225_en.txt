Stone pavement is laid on both sides, approximately five shaku high, about two ken wide, and roughly four ken long, constructed by stacking cut stones. Ancient cedar trees grow in pairs on top of this foundation. The space between the left and right sides is entirely paved with stones for about two and a half ken. From here, stone paving continues through the base of the sacred torii, past the front of the Niō Gate stone steps, for approximately twenty ken. The sacred torii faces south. From here to the Nakasendo highway is a gradually descending main road about two chō long. The east side of the main road is the front gate approach of the main temple quarters, while the west side consists of the sacred precincts of the former palace grounds. Local people call this area "Omitōshi" (the sacred view-through).

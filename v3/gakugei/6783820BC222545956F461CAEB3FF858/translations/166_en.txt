The Running Daikoku Image of Chūzenji Temple

Running Daikoku Image: When we inquire into the origins of this sacred image, in ancient times there was a monk-soldier called Jōge-bō who served as the head priest of Chūzenji. Every autumn, a mouse would come from somewhere unknown, carrying ears of millet and barnyard grass in its mouth, and offer them at the sacred site. The head priest found it mysterious that millet and barnyard grass should exist in such a remote mountain area far from human habitation. He attached a thread to the mouse's foot and followed its trail down to the foot of the mountain, where he found human dwellings. Therefore, that land became the

shrine territory of Chūzenji. Because it was a place discovered by attaching thread to the foot [of the mouse], it was named Ashio-gō (Foot-tail Village) from then on. The head priest immediately felt this was miraculous and reverently enshrined it as Daikokuten (the Great Black Deity). This is because Daikokuten governs the rat (ne) among the twelve zodiac animals. What was also mysterious was that the form of that mouse naturally transformed and manifested the sacred appearance of Daikokuten. Since the image had the form of running, the head priest of that time gave it the title "Hashiri Daikokuten" (Running Daikokuten) and bestowed printed images upon those who worshipped with faith. The miraculous signs were beyond counting. "Running" means the principle of moving swiftly, and writing it in kana as "hashiri" has special secret significance. Therefore, it became a guardian deity for ships at sea, with the belief that ships would run swiftly and never encounter shipwreck even in violent storms. In all paths of life, the responsive power of faith knows no interruption, and for all classes—warriors, farmers, artisans, and merchants—the fulfillment of their wishes proceeds as swiftly as running. Hence it is called the deity of fortune and protection.

This sacred image is also said to have Five Great Vows. First, to the poor and destitute, it grants fortune and

During the religious ceremonies, several dengaku priests come down from Kyoto to participate in the procession and perform dance music at the御旅所 (temporary shrine). Since some years ago, one of the Kyoto dengaku priests has been retained at this mountain, and descendants of one called Senman-zai have been regularly appointed to shrine service, serving at the shrine and participating as dengaku priests during the two annual shrine festivals. Members of this group living in Kyoto are said to use titles such as Senju-man-zai, Jūman-zai, Hyakuman-zai (man-man-zai), and so forth.

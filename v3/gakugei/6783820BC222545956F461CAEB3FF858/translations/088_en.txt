A Sumeru platform is constructed, with Shōgun Jizō Bodhisattva painted on the front panel board. The western room similarly has a platform constructed with Dai-tengu on the front, En no Gyōja on the left, Ushiwakamaru on the right, eight tengu on the western panel, and the true image of the Great Master along with two child attendants (left and right) on the eastern panel, all painted by the brush of Eshi Ryōtaku Hokkyō. A front hall is established four ken and more south of the main hall (three ken by four ken). This serves as the retreat place of Dai-sōjō Tenkai. From around late July of the 18th year of Kan'ei, as a prayer for the birth of the young lord, a ritual platform was built in the center of the main hall where the Dai-sōjō performed the Jie ritual offering. Similarly, platforms were set up on the left and right where monks from this mountain and attendant monks from Tōeizan took turns performing the Jie ritual. The space between the main hall and front hall served as a fire ritual platform where eighty monks from one temple performed goma fire rituals, with the sounds of yamabushi conch shells and the resonance of esoteric offering vessels penetrating throughout the upper and lower mountains. The Dai-sōjō visited the shrine halls of Shingū and Tōshōgū, offering sincere devotion. During the prayers, Nakane-shi climbed the mountain as an imperial messenger, and on the third day of the eighth month,

Miyazaki-shi climbed the mountain as an imperial messenger for celebrating the birth of the young lord. During the prayers, there were various miraculous signs of spiritual response, which are detailed in the Great Master's biography and other records. Afterward, the worship hall was removed, and now only the main hall remains. Because there are painted images of tengu in this hall, it is sometimes called Tengu-dō. Since this hall is located on the mountaintop continuing from the shrine, it is difficult for ordinary people to visit for worship.

Jōgyō-dō　South of the front of the Niō Gate of the Sacred Mausoleum, the two halls of Jōgyō and Hokke stand side by side - the eastern one is Jōgyō-dō and the western one is Hokke-dō. They have copper roofing, double rafters, red-painted railings with carved decorations and coloring, measuring ten ken by five ken. Climbing the mountain between these two halls leads to Jigen-dō. A covered corridor connects the two halls for passage. The principal image in the hall is Amida with a jeweled crown, with four bodhisattvas on the left and right, and Matara-jin enshrined at the back. This hall was first built when Jikaku Daishi initially climbed the mountain during the Kashō years, creating both halls in imitation of Mt. Hiei. At this time he established the Tendai sect, leading to the prosperity of both esoteric and exoteric Buddhism. The Great Master left behind more than ten monks who had followed him from the mountain temple, and together with long-term residents, there were thirty-six people.

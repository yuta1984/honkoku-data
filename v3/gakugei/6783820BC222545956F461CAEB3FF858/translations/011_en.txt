Do not try to scratch an itch through your shoe [i.e., don't approach things indirectly when directness is needed].

One: According to the style of the "Nikkō Kyūki" (Old Records of Nikkō), one should place Yamasuge Bridge at the center and seek temple towers and famous places in all four directions, then afterward record the facts of their founding and the distances of the routes. I think this perhaps symbolizes the way all stars revolve around the North Star. However, if we were to adhere only to the old style, we would probably also lose the convenience of scenic exploration and systematic viewing. Therefore, for now I will follow the various famous place illustrated guides that are popular in the world, and simply record the locations of each according to the order of the route. This has nothing to do with whether historical events are new or old, or whether temple towers and famous places are superior or inferior.

Unless we borrow divine assistance, how could we possibly succeed in portraying their truth? I will observe ritual purification and paint. I will bathe and take up the brush." Thereupon all these gentlemen concentrated their faith, wielded their brushes, and each exhausted their lifetime's artistic talent in devoted effort on this book. How fitting! Everything they copied approached the truth without exception, and once the scroll is opened, on the paper gods suddenly dance and spirits perform. Now, though the literary expression in this collection is quite clumsy, the lifelike masterful paintings of these great artists more than suffice to forever cover the vulgarity of my poor writing. Ah, is this not my boundless great fortune? How could I not beat time and rejoice alone?

One: Since Mount Nikkō has been a sacred site for over a thousand years since the beginning of the world, even a single hill or valley...

Takino-o Waterfall (Takino-o-no-taki)　Also called White Thread Falls (Shiraito-no-taki). Located behind Fudō Hall, it flows down from the rocks for about two jō,
　its cascading form divided into several streams, exactly like scattered flowing white threads. Calling this waterfall
　Sōmen Falls (Sōmen-no-taki) is an error. Sōmen Falls is located south of Kanman, and the origin of calling this mountain valley Sōmen
　Valley (Sōmen-dani) appears in literature.
　The "Kaikoku Zakki" (Record of Traveling the Provinces) states: "What is called Takino-o is an incomparable sacred deity. The sight of the cascading water
　was startling to the eye."
　　Through generations bound by ties of fate, are these the white threads of this Takino-o waterfall?
Bessho (Retreat)　Located to the right after climbing several stone steps. The usual implements for Nikkō-zeme are hung and displayed.
　This retreat is managed by members of the Buddhist community in five-year rotations. Among the shrine priests of the main shrine, one called nirō
　supervises the shrine affairs. It is also said that the custom called Nikkō-zeme
　originated from this retreat. According to local legend, at some point Jizō transformed into human form and came
　to beg for sōmen noodles, and tormenting him was the beginning. There are also theories about badger smoking and such.

　There are rooms in the retreat where ordinary people are not admitted. There is also what is called the "Plaque Room."
　This is perhaps because there is an old plaque of the Nyotai Chūgū (Female Deity Central Shrine) written by Kōbō Daishi. What is now displayed on the tower gate
　is said to be a copy of the old plaque. Among the treasures are many old masks, and among them are some masks that are kept
　as deep secrets and not permitted to be viewed.
　Now, regarding Takino-o: on the 26th day of the 7th month of Kōnin 11 (820), Kōbō Daishi first arrived at this mountain,
　first entering a room at Shihonryūji, and accompanied by the master's disciples Kyōbin, Dōchin, and other followers,
　arrived at Takino-o. Seeing a waterfall that resembled tangled threads, the name "White Thread"
　originated from this time. He named the peak Kameyama (Turtle Mountain) because its shape resembled a crouching turtle.
　The monk Kūkai, feeling this was a sacred spiritual area, built a hermitage beneath the great cedar and
　set up an altar to practice the Buddha-Eye Golden Wheel Dharma for seven days and nights. From underground, a single white jewel
　emerged. Regarding this as the Tenhō Star, he enshrined it, and this is what is called Shōgyokuden (Small Jewel Hall). Moreover,
　while performing religious practices, a single white jewel descended from heaven, floating on the water, saying "I am Myōken Star

Eastern Service Gate: This is the entrance to the shrine precincts from the east. It is also called the rear gate. All those who work within the shrine precincts enter and exit through this location. Since it is near the resting place of the shrine families, it is colloquially called the Shrine Family Gate.

Shrine Families and Temple Priests' Resting Place: Upon entering the aforementioned gate, there is a sacred longhouse attached to the right.

Buried Gate: This is a service entrance beneath the fence wall from Nio Gate to the Sorin Pagoda, located toward the New Shrine horse grounds.

Great Cedar Trees: Near Yomei Gate below the Sacred Drum Tower, there are three or four large cedars with a circumference of approximately one jo or more. According to the tales of elders, these great cedars have been called Gundari Cedars since ancient times. Therefore, in ancient times there must have been a hall of Gundari Myoo (Acalanatha) in this area. Besides these, there are also ancient cedars near Nio Gate and around the Sacred Sutra Repository and Sacred Water House.

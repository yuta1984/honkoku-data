At that time, Lord Sanjō Sanejō came down from the capital and composed:
　　"The old bridge of yamasuge grass, hanging precariously—now in this reign it spans with stone pillars"
　　　　Divine Bridge　　　　　　　　　Korea　Gyeongmyeong-chai
　　Accidentally entering the pot-shaped valley with a smile, looking down at the clear bay from the bridge. The azure dragon drinks the thousand-layered waves while fallen, and the jade rainbow connects diagonally to the mountains on both banks. Autumn travelers wonder—passing the shore in the deep night, people seem to return to the moon palace. Leisurely watching white cranes fly to the ornamental pillars, drunk and leaning against the misty cloud ladder in tranquility.

However, during the flood of Jōkyō 4 (1687), all three stones were buried and disappeared.

Daiya River: The water source emerges from Lake Chūzen-ji and falls to Kegon Falls, then flows through large marshes and deep valleys, hence the name Daiya River. The waterway extends about five ri. While there are places in the upper and lower streams that are easy to cross, the water is extremely cold. However,

Divine Ritual Procession

Spear-bearing soldiers: One hundred soldiers with two guards each. Wearing noshime hemp formal dress, they lead at the front, which is
　the same for all below. The guards advance in two rows at the front and walk in procession. Behind them, soldiers in groups of fifty each
　walk in two rows. They wear bird helmets and hemp robes, fifty each in kite-brown and flower-colored alternately mixed,
　with white phoenixes dyed on the robes. They wear light yellow hakama trousers with wave patterns, each carrying
　a spear in hand. The spears including handles are about eight shaku long, the handles are black lacquered metal entirely gilded, with
　small banner-like objects attached near the sword guard area. Made double-sided, one side yellow-green, the other side
　red brocade. Near the cord attachment, tomoe crests are attached with gilded metal. About one shaku long,
　about six sun wide, with sword-point tips, split into three streamers from the base of the crest. The sword
　points and cord attachment metalwork are all gilded.

Lions: Two heads, with three shrine attendants per head, totaling six people
　Both heads are golden. One has Chinese weaving with black tiger stripe patterns on a
　soot-bamboo colored ground. The other has arabesque-like patterns on blue ground, each with woven designs. What are commonly called
　lions in pictures or carvings all have drooping ears in their depictions. The lions in this mountain's
　divine ritual have upright ears and wear spotted woven cloth, so common people say they must be tiger
　heads. Since no one in Japan or China has actually seen live lions,
　from ancient times when people spoke of lions, they all thought of them as having drooping ears and long hair.
　Since lions appear in ordinary divine rituals, this mountain also calls them lions, but
　they are not lions but must be tigers. One can know this well by observing their form.

Flute: One shrine attendant in yellow robe and court cap

Dengaku priest: One shrine servant

Records of Mount Nikko

【Left Page】
I have written prefaces and postscripts, and composed introductions and citations for geographical works compiled and recorded by contemporary scholars—numbering perhaps ten or more volumes. All of these were done at the request of others. I believe that using the learning I once favored to pursue, such modest work was something I brought upon myself. Recently, in my old age and weariness, my legs no longer obey my heart, and my eyesight has also declined. I have given up my longing for scenic landscapes and ceased my work with brush and inkstone. Morning and evening, I chant the nembutsu and recite sutras to repent for past sins.

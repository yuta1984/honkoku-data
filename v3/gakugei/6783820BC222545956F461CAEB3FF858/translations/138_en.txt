　Then this area must have been the site of old ruins where temples and monks' quarters existed in those days. It is also said that regarding the construction of Dainichi Hall,
　In the 11th year of Kōnin era, when Kōbō Daishi first climbed Mount Nikō,
　Since this place was at the foot of Mount Nikō, he first stopped his staff here and
　Carved a sacred statue of Dainichi Nyorai, built a grass hermitage, and practiced Buddhist law here for a while. Therefore,
　Later a magnificent hall was constructed and there was also a bettō (head priest's residence). However,
　Now only Dainichi Hall remains, but from the appearance of the flourishing ancient trees, it is known
　To be an old historic site. Even now on January 8th, there is a Buddhist service where hall monks from within Nikkō
　Come to perform the service. On this day, both clergy and laypeople visit and form crowds - this is an ancient custom.
　There is something called "ohajiki guidance" where the village commoners gather and芋 boiled in hot water
　Pierced on bamboo skewers are offered as hospitality to the attending hall monks.
　The origin of this is unknown. Also in October, three monks from the mountain come down to perform Buddhist rituals.
　One attendant from the main hall comes first to prepare scattered flowers for the ritual in January.

　It is said that both in January and October, as a duty of this land, they provide relay horses for the monks' round trips. Also,
　The reason the village is named "Shichiri" (Seven Ri) is because it is seven ri along the Bandō road from the area of the sacred bridge within the mountain,
　According to an old local tradition.
Otate-ishi: Located eight or nine chō up in the northwest direction from Dainichi Hall. Long ago, Tarō Myōjin transformed into a great serpent,
　Flew from the northern peaks, raised his tail at the summit of Mount Ikuoka, and then
　Flew to Maruyama in Utsunomiya - this rock formation is said to be that place according to local folk tales.
Sannō Shrine: This is in the territory of Noguchi village, neighboring Shichiri village and adjoining Mount Ikuoka. From Dainichi Hall
　It is to the east, separated by a peak. Its honji (original Buddhist form) is Eleven-faced Kannon. It is said that in the first year of Kashō era,
　Jikaku Daishi founded it and invited Sannō deity. Every year on October 11th,
　After the Buddhist service at Dainichi Hall ended, the Lotus Sutra Eight Lectures were held before this shrine, but for some reason in the medieval period
　Three monks from within the mountain would attend and hold three-question-one-answer debates. This too
　Ceased during the Jōō years when monks stopped attending, though monks from one sub-temple still attend even now.

The Gobessho (Sacred Retreat) is called Anyo-in, and among the six shrine families of the Omiya, the senior-ranking member serves as the administrator of shrine affairs.

Indeed, the Nikko Sansha Gongen of our shrine is a sacred realm where Kannon Bodhisattva manifests in various forms, a spiritual site befitting Buddhist teachings. Therefore, in ancient times during the Jingo-keiun era, Saint Shodo deeply revered the marvelous wisdom and power of Kannon, entered remote uninhabited territories, and finally ascended to the peak of Kurokami Mountain. At that time, the tutelary deities suddenly appeared and bestowed divine commands to jointly protect the Buddhist law and people. The tutelary deities are: Nantai Gongen (Onamuchi-no-mikoto), Nyotai Chugu (Tagorihime-no-mikoto), and Hongu Gongen (Ajisukitakahikone-no-mikoto). Their original Buddhist forms are Senju Kannon, Amida Buddha, and Bato Kannon, with practical manifestations as Daikokuten, Benzaiten, and Bishamonten - the three heavenly beings embodying fortune, wisdom, and virtue. This is what we call Nikko Sansha Gongen.

According to the golden words, "In all directions and all lands there is no place without benefit, no place where [the Buddha] does not manifest. With compassionate eyes watching over all beings, the sea of fortune and longevity is boundless," the wishes of those who have deep faith and earnest devotion are fulfilled as swiftly as an echo responds to a voice. Later, during the Konin era, Kobo Daishi climbed the mountain and exclusively propagated the esoteric teachings of the Three Mysteries and Five Wisdoms. Also during the Kasho era, Jikaku

Daishi ascended and equally propagated both the Shana (Dainichi) teachings and the Shikan (cessation and contemplation) practices of Tendai Buddhism. On that occasion, he rebuilt our shrine. According to the ancient records of our mountain, regarding the first enshrinement of the three deities, when the founding saint resided at Shihonryu-ji temple, he first enshrined them to the southeast of the monastery. Later there was a shrine relocation, and because of this the deities became displeased on several occasions, as recorded in old documents.

The original shrine ground where the saint first installed the sacred images of the three deities was on a hill adjacent to a large river, and from time to time floods would cause reverse waves, making the saint consider that the shrine precincts would eventually become dangerous. He consulted with his disciples Dochin, Kyomin, Sennyo and others, and during the Tencho era moved the shrine buildings to the east of Shogyoku-den. After more than twenty years had passed, in the third year of Kasho, Head Priest Shozen deliberated with his subordinates Sonchin, Horin and others, noting that behind the two halls of Hokke and Jogyo, in the center between the eastern and western Chuin temples, there was no better sacred site than this location, and immediately relocated the shrine there. {{Marginal note: At that time, "behind the two halls of Hokke and Jogyo" refers to present-day Hotoke-iwa (Buddha Rock). The shrine site corresponds to the area around the present bell tower within the Omiya precincts.}} At this time, they first called the old shrine of Shihonryu-ji "Hongu" (Main Shrine) and designated the relocated shrine precincts as "Shingu" (New Shrine). Subsequently, for fifteen generations...

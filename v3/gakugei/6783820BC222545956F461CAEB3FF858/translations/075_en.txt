Sacred Horse Monument (Onjinme-no-hi)　This commemorates the horse that was ridden during the Battle of Sekigahara in Mino Province in the 5th year of Keichō (1600, year of the Metal Rat), which brought
　victory. Therefore, in the year of Hinoe-tatsu of Genna, the year after the Shogun's death, the horse was released
　to this mountain. The stone monument stands beside the Takino-o path.
　　　Sacred Horse Monument　《Height: 4 shaku 5 sun, Width: 1 shaku 2 sun and more, Thickness: 7 sun 5 bu, Three-tiered stone base／Above the five-line inscription are the three large characters "Sacred Horse"》
　In the year Kanoe-ne of Keichō, at the Battle of Sekigahara, riding this horse, the enemy was defeated
　In Hinoe-tatsu of Genna, the year after the Great Tree's death, the horse was released to this mountain, where it lived for fourteen
　years until it died in the Kanoe-uma year of Kan'ei in its stable. Alas, this horse! Swift-footed for a thousand ri,
　First spirited, later gentle—was this not its natural disposition shaped by training? As they say, not stabling at
　a temple but stabling at a slaughterhouse—the gray horse still guards the ruins, the white horse still looks toward the gate. Someone hearing of the horse's
　origin erected this monument at the grave in the 6th year of Enpō (1678) wishing that its fame would not be forgotten. Let viewers
　contemplate this deeply.　This monument was erected by the Kaji family.

Tochi Gate (Tochi-no-onmon)　This place is the Takino-o Main Gate. Built of plain wood, to the left of Buddha Rock is the inner

　River. Ancient cedars and various trees cover the path, and it is secluded and dark without sunlight until reaching the shrine grounds.
　Even in midsummer, entering this sacred precinct is cool, naturally making one forget the blazing
　heat. This sacred realm is the foremost spiritual site of this mountain.

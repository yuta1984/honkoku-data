In heaven I appear as the Great White Star (Venus), and when I descend to this land, I am the wild deity Iwasaku." Having finished this proclamation, he suddenly vanished from sight. Fujito was filled with wonder, and from this time forth inscribed faith deeply in his heart, never neglecting his religious resolve. Finally, at the age of twenty-seven in spring, he took the tonsure and received ordination, accomplishing the great work of founding our mountain temple. When the master was once at Shihonryū-ji, he told his disciples: "That I have opened this sacred mountain, built this monastery, and made it a place of refuge for all under heaven is entirely due to the divine decree of the Bright Star Heavenly Child and the protection of the Great King Jinsha. You and my spiritual descendants in future generations must always revere these two deities and never forget their divine benevolence."

Then, dimly, the noble form of the Great King Jinsha appeared on the northern cliff, and the blue and red serpents he held in his hands were seen to be released toward the great river. At that moment, suddenly and gracefully, like a rainbow floating in the mountain valley, a long bridge of a single span was built from the north bank to the southern cliff. The master, filled with wonder, deeply rejoiced in this mysterious assistance of the great power, and faith penetrated his very being. However, since he had not yet freed himself from ordinary human concerns, he gazed at the long bridge of great serpents and hesitated for a while. Then, how wondrous! Suddenly several stalks of mountain sedge grew upon the serpent bridge, creating what was no different from a new path opened through the mountains. The master, more and more...

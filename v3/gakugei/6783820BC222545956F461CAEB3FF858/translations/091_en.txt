He further contemplated and wished to serve for his entire life before the Sacred Mausoleum to repay the great benevolence. Receiving permission, he moved his residence to this mountain and served daily at the Sacred Mausoleum, attending to duties as if serving during his lord's lifetime. He remained celibate throughout his life, not thinking of the prosperity of children and grandchildren, and had previously requested that his grave be established near the Sacred Mausoleum. He died on the 14th day of the 5th month of Genroku 11 at the age of eighty-seven. That his family line would end after his death was his lifelong wish. His tomb is now located on Midō-yama near the Inner Sanctuary. His conduct was of rare and exceptional character. Now, when this person was still alive, he casually mentioned to his close attendants that Abe Kūen in Edo had probably also died. Though the close attendants wondered what their master was talking about, within two or three days, Kūen's coffin was indeed carried in. Truly, being men of such honor, such extraordinary events must have occurred. This story too was heard from descendants of those close retainers who now live in Nikkō, saying they had received this legend from their ancestors. On top of the stone pagoda is one Sanskrit character, and below it "Junior Fourth Rank, Kaji-uji Sa-"

Monument to Sahyōe no Kami Lord Kaji
Written by Hayashi Kō, Junior Fifth Rank, Acting Director of the Bureau of Education

The late Junior Fourth Rank Sahyōe no Kami Lord Kaji was the son of a retainer of the same surname under Oribe no Kami Suganuma, lord of Nagashima Castle. He was adopted by Lord Kaji and took his surname. He served during the Kan'ei and Shōhō periods with loyalty, sincerity, and careful diligence that surpassed others of his time. The Great Lord Daiyū had him constantly attend at his side, and even when in the inner palace quarters, he would always accompany him.

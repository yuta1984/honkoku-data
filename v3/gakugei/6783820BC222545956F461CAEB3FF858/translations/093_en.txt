Thus he left no heir. His intention was that once one has devoted oneself to serving as a retainer, it would be unbecoming of a man to be concerned with family burdens during times of crisis. Though this may not be considered the middle way, his intention to repay his debt to the nation deserves great admiration. Ah, for the long period of forty-seven years, he never neglected even a single day of visiting and paying respects at the mausoleum hall. Without the utmost loyalty and sincerity, who could do such a thing? A man named Ono Yoshihisa once had the opportunity to serve this lord, and his great-grandson Yoshizumi now serves among the court nobles and holds office in Shimotsuke Province.

Jigen Hall (Jigendō) - This is the mausoleum of Great Master Jigen. Since ancient times, the mountain in this area has been called Daikoku Mountain. His detached residence was called Muryōin Temple and was located at the foot of the mountain. Between the two halls of Hokke and Jōgyō, stairs of a covered corridor are built, and passing under them, one climbs stone steps on the mountain path for about one and a half chō. To the left is a treasure storehouse. Near the stone steps is one large bronze lantern without inscription. Turning right and climbing stone steps for about three ken, there is an entrance gate. Enclosing walls run left and right, and it is about thirteen ken to the worship hall.
Monju Hall (Monjudō) - Located southwest of the entrance gate. This is the honji hall of Great Master Jigen. Dragon

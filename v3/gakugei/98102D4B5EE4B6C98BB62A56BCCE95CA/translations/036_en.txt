　　　Nihon Bridge

From here peaceful and tranquil travelers
Having journeyed through the Eastern Barrier across countless mountains and rivers
Above Edo Castle, auspicious clouds rest quietly
At the head of Nihon Bridge, human activity stirs
Green sashes and red garments constantly flow in succession
Jeweled saddles and golden bridles are always crowded together
What meaning lies in Xiangru's pillar inscription?
Wealth and honor have always resided in Heaven

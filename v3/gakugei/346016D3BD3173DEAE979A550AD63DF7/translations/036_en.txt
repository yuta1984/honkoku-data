According to the "Edo Meisho-ki" (Record of Famous Places in Edo),
since ancient times on the eighth day of every month
and on New Year's morning,
many people would come
to worship before the principal image
where dragon lanterns
would shine.
However, this practice seems to have
ceased in the present day, as even the local people
say they know nothing about it.

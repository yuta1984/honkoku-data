Imai Ferry Crossing
According to the travel account "Azuma no Tsuto" written by Shibaoken Sōchō in the 6th year of Eishō (1509), he wrote: "Taking a river boat on the Sumida River, we spent about half a day touring the territory of Kasai, pushing through reeds and rushes, then disembarked at a ferry crossing called Imai and stopped at Jōkōji, a temple of the Jōdo sect." This indicates that this ferry crossing had existed since ancient times.

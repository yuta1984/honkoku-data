When Umenowaka-maru was seven years old, he escaped from Getsurinji Temple on Mt. Hiei and wandered trying to return to his home in Kitashirakawa in the capital (Kyoto). When he reached Ōtsu Bay, he was deceived and tricked by a merchant named Shinobu-no-Tōta from Michinoku, and came all the way to this Sumida River, as is detailed in the main text.

Incidentally, it is said that the human trafficker Tōta was from Nanbu in Michinoku, and even today people from Nanbu fear his vengeful spirit and do not visit Bokuboji Temple, just as people of the Edo clan refrain from visiting Nitta Myōjin at Yaguchi.

However, it has now been converted to the Tendai sect. The principal image is a painting of Amida Nyorai written in Shinran Shonin's own hand. Kiyoshige, the founder of this temple, was a samurai who served the Kamakura government for generations. In the 5th year of Bunji (1189), after the subjugation of Fujiwara Yasuhira in Oshu, he was appointed to the administrative post of that region in September of the same year, and also joined as an accompanying soldier when Minamoto Sanetomo made his ceremonial visit to Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine. His family resided in this area for generations. When Shinran Shonin was traveling through the eastern provinces for missionary work, he visited this place and stayed at Kiyoshige's residence. At that time, Kiyoshige became devoted to the saint's teachings, took the courtesy of a disciple, and came to be called Saikobō. He also converted his residential land to establish a temple, immediately naming it Saikoin. On the side altar of the principal image, a wooden statue of Prince Shotoku carved by Kiyoshige is enshrined.

Note: According to the Azuma Kagami, on the 10th day of the 11th month of the 4th year of Jishō (1180), when Minamoto Yoritomo returned triumphantly to Kamakura after subjugating Satake Tarō Yoshimasa and Satake Kanja Hideyoshi of Hitachi Province, he granted the Mariko-no-shō estate in Musashi Province to Kasai Saburō Kiyoshige and stayed at his residence that night. Although Kiyoshige had his wife prepare a meal, he reported that he had summoned a serving woman from elsewhere for the service without stating the true circumstances - this too likely occurred at this location.

Kiyoshige Inari Shrine: Located in the fields west of Saikōji Temple, it is an ancient grove where pine and cedar trees grow thickly. This place is said to be the burial ground of Kasai Saburō Kiyoshige. An Inari shrine is now enshrined here. Note: In years past, this mound collapsed in a flood, and a stone chest emerged from the soil. When the villagers opened the lid, they found Sanskrit characters, lotus flowers, and Kiyoshige's name carved on the inside of the lid. At that time, a wooden statue of Amida Buddha over three shaku and five sun in height emerged from the chest. Within its chest was an iron Buddha, a seated statue about one sun and eight bu in height. It is now housed at Saikōji Temple. Various weapons and other items are also said to have emerged.

Former Site of Aoto Saemon-no-jō Fujitsuna's Residence: Located in Aoto Village. Note: According to villagers, in ancient times they produced indigo (aoto), but in later generations this was changed to Aoto (blue door). Note: In the land register of the Odawara Hōjō family from the 2nd year of Eiroku (1559), the name Kasai Aoto is noted within the domains of Tōyama Tanba-no-kami. It is now divided into two villages called Nishi-Aoto and Omote-Aoto. The villagers also call it a castle site or palace ruins. Even now, an area of five to six steps square remains as exempt land, with a small shrine among towering old cedars. Among the farmers of this village, there are those who use place names like "so-and-so of the compound" or "so-and-so of the camp," all of which are said to have been passed down from that era.

Note: According to books such as the Hōjō Kudaiki and Taiheiki, Aoto Saemon was a resident of Izu Province, a descendant of Ōba Jūrō Chikasato. Chikasato achieved great merit in the Jōkyū Rebellion at the Battle of Uji, and as reward was granted the Aoto estate in Kazusa Province. This was passed down through the generations to Fujimitsu. Fujitsuna was born as the youngest son of Fujimitsu by a concubine. If this is so, then the Aoto estate was in Kazusa Province.

Note: However, in a book called Bōsō Shiryō written by Nakamura Kunika of Usui village in Isumi District, Kazusa Province, it states that while Kazusa Province's Aoto estate is mentioned in the Azuma Kagami, its location has not yet been determined, so it is not definite. This place has long been called Aoto, and places said to be Fujitsuna's residence site clearly remain, so while we cannot determine the truth of the matter, we record and add this following the local traditions.

Ancient Wasabi Grater: Note: A farmer of this area named Moemon preserves this. While it may not be worthy of praise, it suffices to imagine the simple customs of ancient times. Therefore, its illustration is included here.

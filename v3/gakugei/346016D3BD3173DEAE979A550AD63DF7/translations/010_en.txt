Iozaki (Hermitage Point)
Commonly called Uketi (Granted Land), in the vicinity of Akiba Gongen shrine, though this is not certain.

From Susaki to the area around Uketi and Akiba, there are many sake and meat shops (restaurants), each equipped with fish ponds where they raise carp. Many drinking customers gather here to hold banquets. Among them, one called Kasai Taro is said to be a distant descendant of Kasai Saburo Kiyoshige, though the truth of this is unknown.

The establishment called "Musashiya" used to sell only barley rice in the old days, so it was called "Bakuto" (barley measure) with the meaning of "mugi-hakari" (barley scale). But now people only call it "Musashiya," and those who know that it was once called "Bakuto" have become rare.

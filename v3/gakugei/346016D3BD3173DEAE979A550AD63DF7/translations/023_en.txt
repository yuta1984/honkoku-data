At Bokuboji Temple there was a poetry gathering

From Kaikoku Zakki (Travel Records):
The appearance of the ancient mound, how touching it is
It seems just like something of today

The water of Sumida River flowing in the shadow of the ancient mound
Even hearing of it makes my sleeves wet with tears

Priest Dōkō

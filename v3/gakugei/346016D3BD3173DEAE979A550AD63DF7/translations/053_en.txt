Until the 10th day, the Buddhist shrine is opened for people to worship the portrait of Saint Shinran, so both monks and laypeople gather in crowds.

Mirror Pond: Located behind the main hall. It is said that when the Saint created his own portrait, he reflected his image in this pond.

Kesa-kake Pine: Located nearby. The old tree has withered and a young tree has now been planted.

Taishi Hall: Located to the right in front of the main hall, facing the Portrait Hall. It enshrines the sacred image of Prince Shotoku. It is said to have been made by the Prince himself, and there are pilgrimages every year on February 21st.

Taishakuten-ō: Enshrined at Kyōei-san Taikyō-ji Temple in Shibamata Village (two and a half ri from Edo). This temple was founded during the Kan'ei era.

According to the temple's origin story, during the time when the ninth-generation priest Nichikei was residing there, the temple buildings were greatly damaged. The priest deeply lamented this and went begging widely in all directions to raise funds for restoration. Finally, when he was about to rebuild the temple buildings, he discovered this wooden principal image from above the beams. There had been a tradition that the temple originally possessed a prayer image carved by the hand of the great founder, and at this time, respecting that this was not in vain, it was made the principal image (a pear wood board measuring 2 shaku 5 sun in length, 1 shaku 5 sun in width, and about 5 bu in thickness).

One side has the main title carved in the center with the Two Honored Ones and Four Bodhisattvas on the left and right, as well as characters meaning "immediate elimination of illness," with "May" written below along with the great master's title and seal. The other side bears the image of Taishakuten-ō, holding a sword in his right hand and with his left hand open, displaying a wrathful countenance.

This is a principal image for eliminating illness and extending life, a sacred form for subduing evil demons. For those who are faithful and respectful, prints of this are given. The lines are clear and it is an unprecedented principal image. In ancient times, when Taishakuten first descended to Shitennō-ji Temple in Settsu, it was also on a kōshin day. Since the appearance of this temple's wooden principal image also occurred on a kōshin day, this day is designated as the temple's festival day due to this connection.

After Tadayoshi's death, Hayakatsu, with the loyalty of a true friend, buried his remains in this place and built a grave mound.

Zuiryūzan Shūsan-ji Temple: Located across from the right side of Sunako-chō in Kawasaki post station. It is a Sōtō Zen temple belonging to Hōsen-ji in Sueyoshi. The principal image, Shakyamuni Buddha, is a seated statue about 1.5 shaku tall and is a Tang-dynasty Buddha. The attendant figures are wooden statues of Monju and Fugen, with unknown sculptors. 《Marginal note: This temple was formerly a bettō-ji (administrative temple) for Yakushi, and Yōkō-ji's Yakushi Buddha was said to be at this temple》According to tradition, this temple was the incense-offering temple (kōke-in) of Sasaki Shirō Takatsuna, and at that time the entire village of Sunako served as the temple's sustaining land. The founding abbot was called Rinshitsu Gentō Oshō. In ancient times it was a Rinzai Zen monastery belonging to Kenchō-ji in Kamakura. Much later, in the Tenshō period, Mamiya Buzen-no-kami Nobumori, a retainer of the Hōjō family of Odawara, 《Marginal note: According to the domain registry of the Odawara Hōjō family from Eiroku 2, Mamiya Buzen-no-kami held lands totaling 698 kan 122 mon, including Sugita, Edo-Kawasaki, Kozukue, and Sueyoshi in Kuraki District of Musashi Province; Kosuzume in Higashi District; Toya in Irinishi District; and the former Monjubō holdings in Miura》being a distant descendant of Sasaki Shirō Takatsuna, donated a temple precinct of eight chō square, invited Elder Shizan, the fourth abbot of Hōsen-ji in Sueyoshi village, to serve as the restoration founder of this temple, and converted it to the Sōtō sect. Nobumori's Buddhist name was Zuiei-in-den Unkoku Shūsan Daishi. His stone pagoda stands beneath a ginkgo tree behind the temple's Buddha hall. 《Marginal note: During the Genroku period, the Mamiya family of the shogunate donated temple lands in Oda village, Kawasaki, their fief, for memorial services for Shūsan Daishi》

《Marginal note: Considering that among the temple treasures, a document from the first month of Genroku 4 (1691) regarding the Mamiya family's donation of temple lands states "Mamiya Buzen-no-kami Nobumori, Buddhist name Shūsan," while the gravestone of the temple's founder is inscribed "Unkoku Shūsan Koji, former Sasaki Buzen-no-kami, monk Minamoto no Yasunobu." This makes Nobumori's Buddhist name Shūsan and Yasunobu's Buddhist name Shūsan, which is still doubtful. However, since the temple is called Shūsan-ji and Yasunobu is called the temple's founder, it seems certain that Yasunobu's Buddhist name was Shūsan》

The principal image protected by Takatsuna is a wooden statue of Nyoirin Kannon, a seated figure 1.5 shaku tall. The sculptor is unknown. It is enshrined in a separate hall to the left of the main hall.

Kaieisan Yōkō-ji Temple: Located about four chō ahead of Shūsan-ji, on the left side of the road in Sunako-chō. It is a Sōtō Zen temple belonging to Shūsan-ji. It is a temple founded by Abbot Shigetsu. The principal image is a seated statue of Yakushi Nyorai about 2.5 shaku tall. It is said to have manifested from the sea at this location in Enryaku 6 (787), the year of hinoto-u. 《Marginal note: According to local tradition, when this principal image manifested from the sea in ancient times, sand from the seashore was collected and it was enshrined upon it, hence the place name Sunako (sand child) arose. This sacred image was formerly the principal image of Shūsan-ji but was later moved to this temple》

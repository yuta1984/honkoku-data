(Upon examination, Emperor Toba was born on the 16th day of the 1st month of the 5th year of Kōwa [1108]. The 5th month [mentioned earlier] must be an error.) The emperor's joy was extraordinary, and by imperial edict he bestowed the name Koike-san Tōfuku-ji. Much later, during the Bunki and Eishō eras (1504-1521), when warfare frequently broke out in the eastern provinces, [the temple] fell into great decline, but only the Daihi-kaku (Hall of Great Compassion/Kannon Hall) remained intact.

(The temple monks say that even now, when those with prayers visit the principal image of this temple, requesting donations from various people and setting a term limit while calling it "service to the principal image," when they pray with sincere faith, there is no case where their various wishes are not fulfilled even before the term of service is completed.)

Senkaku-san Shōon-ji Temple: Located in Higashi-Terao village (until around the Kyōhō era it was called Shōon-ji). It is a Zen temple of the Rinzai sect, an ancient temple founded by Zen Master Busshu of Unkei-an at Kenchō-ji in Kamakura.

(The Zen master is said to have passed away on the 18th day of the 2nd month of the 2nd year of Kenmu [1335]. The Kamakura-shi records it as the 18th day of the 2nd month of the 3rd year of Bunwa [1354]. This land was the domain of Unkei-an.) The principal image, Shakyamuni Buddha, is a seated statue about two shaku tall.

Jigen-dō: About one chō across from Shōon-ji Temple, exiting the gate and going down and around a small slope for about two and a half chō, it is located on top of a hill. The principal image is Eleven-faced Kannon, created by the Buddhist sculptor Kasuga. It is one of the Kozukue pilgrimage sites and is administered by Shōon-ji Temple.

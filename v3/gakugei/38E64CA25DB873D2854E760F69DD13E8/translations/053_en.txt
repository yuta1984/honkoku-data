In the eighth month, after the defeat at Ishibashiyama in Izu Province, when crossing over to Awa Province, [Yoritomo] escaped the peril of wind and waves through the divine power of the principal deity, and later finally achieved the unification of the realm. Therefore, during the Bunji era (1185-1190), a shrine was constructed at this location and sacred lands were donated to it. Much later, when Ōta Dōkan was at this location, he showed the deepest reverence and faith.

Sode-ga-ura (Sleeve Bay) - The scenery of this place, with its long shores and winding inlets, resembles the shape of a sleeve, hence the name. When Karasumaru Dainagon Mitsuhiro traveled down to the Kantō region, on his return journey he stopped at this place again and composed a waka poem《Note: The draft he personally wrote at that time is secretly preserved in the house of a certain Edoya family of this area》

"Staying at Sode-no-ura this time"
Who would have thought that the waves of Sode-no-ura would return, and I would lodge here again on my journey - Mitsuhiro

《Note: According to examination, in the Kōyō-shū collection, the first five characters are changed to "Azumachi no" and the final "to wa" is changed to "to ya." The Kōyō-shū version is probably a copying error》

Fuji Sengen Shrine - Located on the mid-slope of a mountain to the right of the Shibao Village highway, south of the same location

《Small print: It is said that this was carved as a memorial service. The Tōkaidō Meishoki states that during the Kan'ei era, there was a man named Kinokuniya Sakunai at Kyōbashi in Edo who was completely illiterate, making sake brewing his trade. Sakunai deeply revered this principal image and constantly made pilgrimages.》
《Small print: One night in a dream, the Great Master taught him to write the six-character sacred name. Finding this strange, the next day he made a pilgrimage to the Great Master of this temple, and on his way home picked up a pair of brushes on Rokugō Bridge. From then on, he wrote the sacred name that the Great Master had taught him》
《Small print: and his brushwork was truly incomparable in excellence, so Sakunai carved the sacred name on a stone pagoda and erected it at Daishi-gawara. However, he could not write even a single character of anything else.》

According to the founding legend, the sacred image of Kōbō Daishi was obtained during the Taiji era by a fisherman of the Hirama family who lived by this bay and who constantly revered the Three Treasures. His family was poor with no means to expand their livelihood, and he had spent years in vain, already reaching the age of forty-two.
Therefore, he prayed to the gods and buddhas for the elimination of disasters and misfortunes, when one night the Great Master appeared and said: "Long ago, when I was in Tang China, I carved my own portrait, vowed that it would drift to a destined land, and cast it into the sea. After lying long on the ocean floor, it has now fortunately come to rest in this bay.
If you cast your net and retrieve it, I will eternally spread beneficial transformation in this land, eliminate calamities and difficulties, and ensure the complete fulfillment of people's wishes." The fisherman awoke from his dream, thinking it strange, and waited for dawn to look out over the sea, where he saw a single beam of brilliant light.

He brought his boat to that spot and lowered his net, and indeed obtained a sacred image of the Great Master whose appearance did not differ in the slightest from what he had seen in his dream. Therefore, he founded a temple and named it Heiken-ji.《Small print: Taking the Hirama family name to create the temple name》From that time forward, the temple's spiritual efficacy has been remarkable, and pilgrims never cease to visit. On the 21st days of the 1st, 5th, and 9th months, and especially on March 21st when the Miei-ku memorial service is held, it becomes very crowded.

Hachiryu Cup: This is preserved in the house of the Ikegami family of Daishi-gawara village. Long ago during the Keian era, this cup was used during a sake battle held in this area, and it is said to hold over seven gō of sake.
Inside the cup, the forms of a bee, dragon, and crab are depicted in maki-e lacquerwork. 《Small print: The bee stings, the dragon drinks, and the crab pinches food, containing these meanings》
According to tradition, the Ikegami family served the Hōjō house of Odawara. After the fall of Odawara, they moved to Ikegami village and took Ikegami as their family name. 《Small print: Later they moved to the present location》This family are descendants of the sake enthusiast Daijamaru Sokofuka who appears in the Suichōki. 《Small print: Sokofuka's common name was Ikegami Tarōemon》In the first year of Keian, eighth month, Jigōbō Taruji of Ōtsuka in Edo 《Small print: Also called Ibaraki Shunsaku. Shunsaku's story is annotated under Shōun-ji temple in Koishikawa in Volume 4》came to Sokofuka's house, and Taruji and Sokofuka both became sake generals, gathering many sake soldiers and dividing into enemy and allied forces.

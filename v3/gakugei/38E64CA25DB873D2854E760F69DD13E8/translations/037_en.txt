　Farewell at Kanagawa Station
Departing with farewell feast, looking west toward the mountain peak, the mountain holds a cup
Asking about the sword-washing blue waves that wish to pass through the Tamakusu barrier
Over Kanagawa's sea, purple mist hangs in the distance
A traveler like floating clouds, slow to depart at dusk, shedding tears for old friends
With aging temples and a face of parting, at the post station
Unable to dispel the soul-melting emotions, the traveling horses flutter
Seeing off the journey back and forth
　　　　　Nangaku

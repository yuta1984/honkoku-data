From Kyōto Kikō (Kyoto Travel Record):
The floating world of Kanagawa's deep pools and rapids causes people to lose their way in the waters of their hearts - Takuan

This place is also recorded in the Taiheiki. During the Musashino Battle on the 20th day of the intercalary second month of Shōhei 7 (1352), the brothers Nitta Yoshioki and Wakiya Yoshiharu were finally defeated by over 200 cavalry and had nowhere to flee. Thinking that if they were destined to die in battle, they might as well enter Kamakura and meet Ashikaga Samanosuke (Ashikaga Takauji) to lose their lives, they passed through Sekido after midnight. On the way, they encountered the forces of Ishidō Nyūdō, Miura-no-suke and others, immediately joined with these forces, arrived at Kanagawa, and inquired about the situation in Kamakura.

Also, in the Kamakura Ōsōshi, it records that on the 6th day of the 4th month of Eikyō 12 (1440), Uesugi Shurinotayu Mochitomo left Izu Province, returned to Yamanouchi-no-shō, stayed in Nagao-gō, and on the 11th day of the 5th month of the same year, advanced to Kanagawa.

Kaminashi River - This refers to a small ditch that flows across the road between Nakanomachi and Nishinomachi in Honshuku. The bridge built at this location is called Kaminashi Bridge (the bridge is less than two ken in length).

The water constantly runs dry, leaving only a small stream. Because the water source is uncertain, it is called Kaminashi River (Upper Waterless River). This is the origin of the place name Kanagawa, and in later times, the two characters "nashi" (waterless) were abbreviated to become "Kana River." Shinagawa is similarly "Shimonashi River" (Lower Waterless River), and this too came to be called so by omitting the two characters "nashi," as recorded in Saitō Tokugen's travel record from Kan'ei 5 (1628). (In the Odawara Hōjō family's allotment register, it states that a person named Yano Hikoroku held land in Nanjō Takasaki in Bushū Kanagawa.)

Kaiun-zan Nōman-in - Called Manganji Temple. Located on the right side of the road from Honshuku Arai-machi. It belongs to the old school of Shingon Buddhism and is affiliated with Toriyama Sankai-ji. The founder was a person named Utsumi Mitsuyoshi. The founding priest was called Jūun. The principal image, Kokūzō Bosatsu (Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva), is a miraculous statue of 3 sun and 9 bu that appeared from the sea.

According to tradition, on the 13th day of the 8th month of Shōan 1 (1288), there was a fisherman of this area named Utsumi Shinshirō Mitsuyoshi. On this day, he lowered his net into the sea and obtained this miraculous statue. Then the principal image possessed Mitsuyoshi's daughter and said, "I am from Bōshū (Awa Province)..."

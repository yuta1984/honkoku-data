Shōkisan Senkokuji Temple - Called Hongaku-in. Located five to six chō away from Shiroyama (Castle Mountain), on the left side of Nagatsuda road, with cherry tree rows on both sides for about three chō leading to the main gate. ⟪The local place name is called "Izumi-ga-tani" (Spring Valley), which is why it became the temple's name⟫ It belongs to the Jōdo sect and is affiliated with Chion-in Temple in the capital (Kyoto). The principal image is a wooden statue of Amida Nyorai in the Ikkō Sanzon style, measuring about 2 shaku 8 sun. The sculptor is unknown. This temple was founded by a person called Suzuki Tajima-no-kami. ⟪This person's details are unknown⟫ The founding priest was called Myōrensha Kenyo Daidō Zen'etsu Daiosho. ⟪Died on August 2nd, Kōji 1⟫ ⟪He was the sixth generation of Kōkyō-ji Temple in Iinuma, Shimōsa Province⟫ In front of the middle gate stands a notice board from Tenshō 18, erected by the Odawara Hōjō family in Tenshō 18.

Awashima Myōjin Shrine - Located in Orimoto village, thirteen to fourteen chō to the left from Ōkuma village on the Sagami highway. Shrine priest Kumoji serves there. The festival is on February 3rd, with regular festivals on the 3rd and 13th of each month. The enshrined deities are Sukunahikona-no-mikoto and Empress Jingū, two seats in total. The origin of the shrine's establishment is unclear.

Cherry tree ⟪Located to the east of the shrine grounds. Long ago, a local person entered this mountain intending to cut an old cherry tree for firewood, and after cutting it and some time passing, when he came to take it from the mountain, beside that old tree⟫

⟪there was a large serpent guarding the tree, seeming to deeply cherish it. The villager thought: "Perhaps if this was a tree near the shrine, it might have been a tree beloved by the deity of this shrine," and feeling somehow fearful, he never laid hands on that tree again. It is said the tree remained rotting on the mountainside until around the Hōei and Shōtoku eras. Now, young shoots that grew from its root stock, which were above the shrine, have been moved to the west of the shrine grounds. What was planted to the east of the shrine was divided from those roots around the Hōei era⟫

Monument to Awashima Shrine
⟪In the summer of Kanpō 2 (Mizunoe-inu year), a person called Fujiwara Terumune, the village headman of Orimoto, conspired with the villagers to renovate this shrine. Since this area was then the domain of Lord Matsushita, Terumune reported this matter to him. The lord immediately dedicated several hundred paces of land near the shrine to this shrine. Terumune withdrew and requested text from Priest Ryōyo of Zenpuku-ji Temple in Azabu, and calligraphy from Usekisan-jin. The seal script was by Honda Yasutake, and the dragon painting by Furuyama Taira Kunitoyo. The text is omitted here⟫

Residence of Tame Suō-no-kami - Thought to be within Aoki town, but the exact location is uncertain. In the Odawara-ki, under the section about Shingen attacking Odawara, it states that Tame Suō-no-kami resided at a place called Aoki at that time. ⟪Details are in the section on Hodogaya Maita Castle. The Kantō Kosen-roku shows this person was at Nishimaki Castle on the border of Shinshū and Jōshū provinces, and died in battle when the fortresses of Kunimune, Iwakura and others in Jōshū Province fell. The Hōjō family's domain register shows that Tame Shinzaemon held Aoki⟫
⟪Upon consideration, while the Odawara-ki describes Tame Suō-no-kami as a retainer of Kira Sahyōe-no-suke Yoshikado, examining the Hōjō family's domain register makes it clear he was a Hōjō retainer. Since Yoshikado was Hōjō Ujiyasu's brother-in-law, he likely made Shinzaemon into Suō-no-kami later and assigned him from Odawara to the Kira family as an attached retainer, which is why he belonged to the Kira family⟫

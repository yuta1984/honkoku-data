This belongs to Tentoku-ji, a Shingon Buddhist temple in Hodogaya. There is a dark cave at this location, which the local people call the "Hitoana (Human Cave) of Fuji." According to tradition, long ago when Lord Yoritomo was hunting in the foothills of Mount Fuji, he ordered Nitano Shirō Tadatsune to explore the depths of Fuji's Human Cave. Tadatsune finally entered this cave and emerged from it. Although this is a groundless tale, it has been passed down from ancient times, so it cannot be omitted here.

Shūkan Benzaiten Shrine - Located in Yokohama Village of Nogi Shinden. Therefore, the local people also call it Yokohama Benten. The superintendent temple is of the Shingon sect, and Zōtoku-in of the same location serves it. The festival is held on the 16th day of the 11th month. The statue of Benzaiten enshrined there is the work of Kōbō Daishi and is made from the same wood as the one at Enoshima. This place is Susaki, facing the sea on both left and right sides, where the pine wind of the seashore echoes with the sound of waves. It is a place of most beautiful scenery. In the sea there are strange rocks called Ubashima and such, making the view extremely beautiful.

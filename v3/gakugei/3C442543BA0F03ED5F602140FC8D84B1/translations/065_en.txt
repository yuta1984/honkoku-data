　　Coming-of-Age Celebration Letter
I am writing this letter to you. In this season of autumn's chill, I trust that you are increasingly prosperous, which brings me great joy. Today, on this auspicious day, I understand that your son has celebrated his coming-of-age ceremony.

This is indeed a joyous occasion. I am sure the ceremony suited him very well. This gift is quite modest, but I present it as a small token of celebration. Furthermore, I shall visit you later to offer my congratulations in person.

I hold you in especially high regard. Now then, regarding the performance of the Daidai Kagura,
I understand that your son
has gone on pilgrimage to Ise. I imagine that your journey
has been blessed with continued fine weather and other favorable circumstances, providing exceptional
comfort and pleasure, which I find most enviable.

I am filled with admiration. In connection with this, though it is but a humble offering,
I present a basket of fresh fish as a small
token of my regards for your consideration.
Furthermore, should you have any suitable requests or needs,
please do not hesitate to ask anything of me.

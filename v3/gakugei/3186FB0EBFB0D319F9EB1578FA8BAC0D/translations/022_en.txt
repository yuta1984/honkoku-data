○The shamisen is originally a musical instrument from the Ryukyu Kingdom. It is also written as "shamisen." In recent times, this shamisen is widely played throughout all provinces. Although it is an instrument with sensual tones, it is a versatile instrument in terms of tuning. Therefore, for the enjoyment of snow, moon, and flowers, and other entertainments, playing a piece on the shamisen is considered essential. Also, the kokyū (Japanese fiddle) was likely created based on the shamisen.

○Theater originated from performing kyōgen on grass mats spread on riverbanks, which was similar to today's street performers. Gradually it became more refined, with elaborate costumes and props, dividing roles into leading men (tachiyaku), female impersonators (onnagata), and villains (tekiyaku). In the three major cities (Edo, Kyoto, Osaka), permanent theaters were permitted, becoming places of entertainment for the common people. Thus it came to be called "shibai" (theater).

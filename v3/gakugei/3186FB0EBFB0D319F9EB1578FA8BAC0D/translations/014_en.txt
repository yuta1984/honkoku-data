○The koto (Japanese zither) was first created by Fuxi. There are fifty-string and twenty-five string versions, and the instrument called "shitsu" used in music is called "wagon." The thirteen-string koto enjoyed by people in society is called "tsukushi-goto." There are many people skilled in musical performance.
○Incense possesses the virtues of purity and cleanliness, and is burned before shrines and Buddhist altars to ward off defilement. Its fragrance reaches far distances. Kyara (aloeswood) sinks when placed in water, hence it is called "jinkō" (sinking incense). It comes from China.

○Kemari (kickball) originated in China during the time of Empress Nüwa, when a rebellious retainer named Chiyou plotted rebellion and started a war. Although Nüwa was a female emperor, she possessed sacred virtue, so all the people followed her, and she finally defeated and destroyed Chiyou, beheading him. The people hated Chiyou and kicked his head. This is said to be the beginning of kemari. The kemari court requires planting four trees: pine, maple, willow, and cherry. The Asukai and Namba families are the imperial houses of kemari. There are also the Kamigamo shrine family and the Matsushita school.

In our country, Chinzei Tametomo, Noto-no-kami Noritsune, Nasu no Yoichi and others were archery masters. Besides these, there were many other skilled military archers.

○The horse refers to the techniques of horsemanship. Since this is an essential way for warriors, it is crucial to receive instruction from a master and practice. Depending on whether one is skilled or unskilled, even a fine horse can develop bad habits. It is said there are a hundred types of such habits. There are established methods for training horses and correcting their bad habits, and since ancient times there have been eight schools of horsemanship. Today, the Otsubo school is primarily employed as the essential way for warriors. Easily climbing treacherous mountain terrain and crossing great rivers - these are all due to the excellent abilities of fine horses.

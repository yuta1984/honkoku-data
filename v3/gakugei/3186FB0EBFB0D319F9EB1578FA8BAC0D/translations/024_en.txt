○The founder of the "hachi-tataki" (bowl beaters) is the monk Kūya. They live in Kūya-dō temple in Shimogyō and make their living by carving tea whisks. From December 13th, they walk around selling through the streets of Kyoto. People buy large tea whisks for New Year as auspicious items.

○The "Kashima no kotofure" (Kashima proclamations) refers to the annual spring practice where Kashima Daimyōjin (the great deity of Kashima) gives divine oracles about the year's fortune and misfortune, people's fate, and the success or failure of the five grains, which are then proclaimed throughout the provinces.

○Monkey dancing is said to be an ancient art. Those who currently come to Kyoto apparently come from the Fushimi area. At the beginning of the year, they go up to the Imperial Palace as an auspicious performance to dance celebratory pieces. Also, in rural areas where cattle and horses are raised, they have monkeys dance during autumn harvest time for prayers. The reason is that monkeys are called "fathers of the mountain" and horses are called "children of the mountain," as written in a book called "Ainō-shō."

○ Fuxi was an emperor of China and
a great sage. At the beginning of human civilization,
he made nets to teach hunting and fishing
to the people. He also drew the Eight Trigrams
and created the se and qin musical instruments.

sage. He taught people how to cultivate
the five grains, and also established markets
to provide the benefits of trade.

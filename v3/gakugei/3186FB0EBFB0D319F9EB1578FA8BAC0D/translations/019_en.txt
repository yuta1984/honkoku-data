○Mountain ascetics (yamabushi) are also called practitioners of Shugendō. This is a teaching of the Shingon sect. They practice austerities to discipline their bodies, and also climb high mountains and great mountains to perform training. They constantly study astronomy and the I Ching to divine people's fortunes and the eight trigrams, and consider palm reading for good and bad fortune, the severity of illnesses, and the direction of lost objects. There is also a sect that practices the teachings of En no Gyōja. These are called the senior guides of ascetics. They pray for people's illnesses. There are purification grounds, which are called ascetic baths.

○Hawks have been prized in China since the time of the Five Emperors. Their arrival in our country began when Empress Jingū received the first hawk as tribute from the kingdom of Baekje. Later, during the reign of Emperor Nintoku, when hawks were presented from Tang China, imperial hunts were organized to catch various birds. This was the beginning of falconry. Since hawks have vigorous courage and are birds associated with military preparedness, it is natural that they are prized by the warrior class.

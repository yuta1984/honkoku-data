○The tea ceremony has existed since ancient times, but it was Sen no Rikyū who began calling tea rooms "sukiya" and establishing detailed protocols extending even to the planting of vegetation and cuisine. Furuta Oribe, Kobori Enshū and others were masters of the tea ceremony, with various schools of practice. It serves as an aid in understanding human relationships and proper conduct. Originally, the tea ceremony is said to have as its fundamental principle the elimination of extravagance and the cultivation of reverence.

○Flower arrangement: Ikenobō, the head priest of Rokkakudō temple in Kyoto, is the master of rikka (formal flower arrangement). Every year on July 7th, disciples gather to arrange flowers, which people of all social classes come to view. There are also masters of nageire (informal arrangement) in various places. In modern times, nageire is especially practiced and flower gatherings are numerous. This is quite natural. Since flowers comfort the human heart and dispel melancholy, it is a fine art that becomes an entertainment for people of all social ranks, which is reasonable.

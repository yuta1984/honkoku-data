Two Guardian Kings (Niō Kongō)
○ The right one is called Right Assistant Vajra (Uhitsu Kongō). Also called Nārāyaṇa Vajra, who rejoices in people's good deeds.
○ The left one is called Left Assistant Vajra (Saho Kongō). Also called Guhyapāda Vajra, who rejoices in people's cessation of evil deeds. Since they are guardian deities of Buddhist law, they are enshrined at the temple gates.

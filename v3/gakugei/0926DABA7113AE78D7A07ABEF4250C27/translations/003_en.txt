Flowing water, passing years, and scattering flowers—which will last until the end, asking "what will become of this"?
They were comparing transient things with each other. There must have been secret romantic encounters between men and women.

(51) Long ago, a man heard someone planting chrysanthemums (senzai):
"Plant, plant—will there be a time without autumn? The flowers may scatter, but would the roots wither?"

(52) Long ago, there was a man. Someone sent him decorative rice dumplings, so in reply:
"Gathering iris, you wander lost in the marsh, while I go to the fields to gather—how lonely!"
And he sent a pheasant.

(53) Long ago, a man met a woman difficult to see, and while they were talking, a bird sang:
"Why does the bird sing? My secret feelings tell me the night is still deep."

(54) Long ago, a man sent this to an indifferent woman:
"On the sleeves that wander the endless dream path, does the dew of heaven's sky settle?"

(55) Long ago, a man's beloved woman became unlikely to become his:
"Could I help but think? Yet with each word spoken, I find myself hopeful."

(56) Long ago, a man lay down thinking, got up thinking, and overwhelmed by thoughts:
"My sleeves are not a grass hermitage, yet when evening comes, they become a lodging for dew."

(57) Long ago, a man had secret sorrows. To an indifferent person:
"Weary with love, like the seaweed that fishermen gather for shelter—I have crushed my own body!"

(58) Long ago, a passionate, amorous man (Narihira) built a house in a place called Nagaoka and lived there. The neighboring imperial princesses (daughters of Emperor Kammu) had incomparably excellent ladies-in-waiting who, living in the countryside, came to harvest rice. Seeing this man (Narihira) there, they said, "What a great libertine's doing!" and gathered to enter his house. This man (Narihira) fled and hid in the back. The woman said:
"It has fallen to ruin. Alas, how many generations has this dwelling seen? No word comes from those who lived here."
Having gathered and sat in this palace, the man responded:
"The painful thing about this dwelling, overgrown with weeds and fallen to ruin, is that even temporarily, demons (referring to the women) gather here."
When these women said they would "gather rice ears":
"Hearing that you gather fallen ears in distress, I too would like to go to the rice fields."

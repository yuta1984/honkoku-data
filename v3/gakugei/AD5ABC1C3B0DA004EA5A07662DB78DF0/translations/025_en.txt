Shinobazu Pond (Shinobazu-no-ike)
Lotus Viewing (Hasu-mi)

Shinobazu Pond is Edo's premier lotus pond. When summer arrives, lotus leaves layer upon layer flourish across the water's surface, and the flowers display mixed colors of red and white, with their fragrant aroma enveloping visitors. Those who love lotuses especially cherish the early morning view as an exceptionally pure and beautiful scene.

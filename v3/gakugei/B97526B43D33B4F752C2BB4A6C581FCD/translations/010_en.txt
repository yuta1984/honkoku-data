[Master Bunsai] entrusted his collection of books to the master. Initially, the venerable Unei and Master Gyokuho Sō, expecting the master to be a dharma vessel, invited him, but he did not accept. When Zen Master Meidō Kokyō (Ittōteki) resided at Yōshun-an in the district, the master hurried to see him. His wit was versatile and his responses like echoes - truly a golden fish passing through nets, like suddenly reining in a blue-black horse. When Kokyō moved to Nanshū-ji in the same district, the master served as attendant, carrying towel and water bottle, studying day and night. Kokyō, knowing the master had achieved some enlightenment, granted him certification and gave him the name "Takuan," composing a verse to express its meaning. When the master commissioned an artist to paint Kokyō's portrait for longevity and requested an inscription, Kokyō took up his brush and wrote: "The rough face is easy to depict, but the inner essence is hard to capture. His usual methods can enter the demon realm and return, subduing demons. The living mechanism of the sect is free - one who can enter the Buddha realm and still kill Buddhas." Thrusting out his fly-whisk, he said, "Isn't this the bottom of the father stealing sheep and hiding it - isn't this Master Peng?" I laughed and said, "Why don't you ask about establishing great peace in the world?" The master accepted this and treasured it protectively. In the same district lived one called Sōmu, who especially invited monks for his late father's memorial services, particularly requesting National Master Enkan to enter the chamber. The master's responses were quick and agile, like jade turning and pearls revolving. At this time, Kokyō lay ill at Yōshun-an, but hearing of the master's dialectical examinations, he was amazed and praised him, saying "He is truly a prodigy." After Kokyō's death, the master led the community and filled the seat at Yōshun-an. In Keichō 17 (1612), at age thirty-five, the master moved to the main temple board and succeeded to Rintoku Zen. That autumn in the eighth month, he became abbot of Ryūkō-zan Nanshū Zen temple, and after two years entered the main temple Daitoku. He offered incense for Master Kokyō and resided on the mountain with the refined flavor of the ancients. Before long, he announced his return to Sennan, where the clergy and laity came out to welcome him, rejoicing as if seeing the Buddha. In the same district, one called Sōin founded a hermitage called Shōun and invited the master to be the founding abbot. The master expounded the dharma, celebrating and praising it. In Sennan and at Ryūhō, observing their comings and goings, he knew their importance. His Highness Shinyin entered the master's meditation chamber one evening to inquire about the Way, and the next morning sent a letter of thanks. In Keichō 18 (1613), he renovated Nanshū's bell tower, and in Keichō 19 (1614) rebuilt Daisen's Shūun Pavilion. In his leisure from meditation, the master compiled a chronology of Master Daitō and stored it at Unmon-an. In Keichō 20 (1615), Nanshū suffered a fire disaster, and the master consulted with the district magistrate about rebuilding Nanshū south of the district, proceeding neither hastily nor slowly, soon restoring its former appearance. The master viewed fame and profit like dust, and sounds and colors like bubbles and illusions. Sometimes he was in Sennan, loving profound depths and deep tranquility throughout the realm; sometimes he stayed at Hōrin-an in Nanjing, concealing his light and hiding his brilliance; sometimes he entered the scenic beauty of Hase, embracing mists and clouds in chronic illness; sometimes he sojourned at Myōshō-ji in Yamashiro Takigi, maintaining emptiness and silence.

After this lifestyle, he returned to his native place in Sanin and built a thatched hut below Mount Sūkyō, naming it Tōen Pavilion. In a three-legged pot he cooked hemp, wheat, millet, and beans for daily meals, showing no signs of hunger. In Kan'ei 6 (1629), the master had some matter with the venerable Gyokushitsu and was exiled together to distant frontiers. However, the master knew that his movements were governed by fate and did not change his expression. In Kan'ei 9 (1632), the shogunate issued an edict recalling the two masters. The master reached Buryō and established a hermitage called Kensoku in a place within the sound of one cow's lowing in a village outside the castle, temporarily residing there. The shogunate summoned the master to the camp and frequently inquired about the dharma, showing excellent favor with ever-increasing expectations. In Kan'ei 15 (1638) autumn, the master went to the capital. The Retired Emperor summoned him to enter the Imperial Palace to lecture on the "Treatise on Original Man," his arguments rising like rushing rivers. His Imperial Majesty was greatly pleased, and the master petitioned: "The second generation of our temple, Zen Master Tetsuō Yuiyu, has a title but no National Master designation. Please issue an imperial edict." The Retired Emperor granted this, and the imperial seal was issued without delay, posthumously naming him National Master Tennō Daigen. Such was his merit to past ancestors. The shogunate established a temple complex south of the golden castle at Shinagawa and had the master serve as abbot, calling the mountain Banshō and the temple Tōkai. On the day of completion, he composed congratulatory verses, and thereafter when the imperial palanquin entered the mountain, even the plants and trees generated light. The master, following imperial command, composed a waka poem praying for the solidity of the national foundation and celebrating the long prosperity of the new construction. In Kan'ei 18 (1641), an envoy was sent ordering him to assume leadership at the main temple, establishing regulations and restoring old rules. This imperial command was based on the master's own wishes. His contributions to the main temple can thus be known. In Shōhō 2 (1645) summer, he was ordered to draw a circular symbol, personally adding a dot of ink in the center and writing an inscription above it as a longevity portrait. In the tenth month of the same year, he showed illness, knowing in advance that his karmic connections were ending. His final instructions were: "Bury my whole body in the back mountain. Do not chant sutras or hold memorial services. Do not accept condolence gifts from clergy or laity. The monks should wear robes and eat meals as on ordinary days. Moreover, do not trouble the court by seeking a posthumous title. Do not place a wooden tablet in the ancestral hall of the main temple," and so forth. For a full month he did not recover. One day at dawn, he took up a brush, wrote the single character "dream," and passed away peacefully. This was actually the eleventh day of the twelfth month. His worldly age was seventy-three, his monastic age fifty-nine. His whole body was buried in the northwestern hill of Tōkai, with only pine trees planted above and no pagoda erected, following his dying wishes. Among his disciples in Sennan, those at Shōun erected a pagoda called Jakunen. His former study disciple, the layman Yasusai of the Takeno clan, in past years recorded the master's deeds and sought to inscribe his pagoda, but this was delayed...

Record of the Ten-Thousand-Year Stone: On this day, the 14th day of the 3rd month of Kanei Mizunoto-Hitsuji (1643), the Shogun happened to move his seat to this pond. There is an island in the pond, and on the island there is a mysterious stone. Even upon close inspection, it has no strange or grotesque form, neither precipitous nor jutting upward. Is it perhaps like the stone of the intoxicated Kuriri-o (Tao Yuanming), or the stone of the sober Li Deyu? Neither is the case. Is it the decayed bones of Fangfeng, or the white forehead of Yutu? Neither is the case. It simply stands abruptly in the grass, foolishly containing virtuous appearance. This is because those in the world who seek the strange have never known what makes this stone precious - it uniquely possesses the essence of tranquil emptiness and has the body of the immortal valley spirit. It is like the ultimate void, seeming to maintain profound stillness. The lord (Shogun) commanded his retainers saying, "This stone should not be without a name. Each of you should share your thoughts." Here, though the various men had thoughts, they also had fears, and were half hesitant. At that time, Kobori Enshu-no-kami Masakazu was attending by the tea brazier. When the lord gave his command, Masakazu immediately rose, faced the stone, and called out "Ten-Thousand-Year Stone" three times. The stone nodded three times. The lord spoke fine words saying, "Without doubt, this is the Ten-Thousand-Year Stone." One word of great magnanimity settles all under heaven - how much more so for a stone! Ah, stone! Stone! Once it entered the lord's sight, it immediately emitted light and transformed its appearance. This was indeed due to the word "ten thousand." It need not necessarily be limited to ten thousand. Generally, numbers begin with one and end with ten, begin with ten and end with one hundred, begin with one hundred and end with one thousand, begin with one thousand and end with ten thousand. Calculating with ten thousand, one knows not how many tens of hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of years. Taking this infinity as the stone's lifespan, and comparing the stone's lifespan to the lord's longevity, even if mountains pile up to 18,000 fathoms high, are they still at the foothills? Calculated by generations, one again knows not how many tens of thousands of generations. I inscribe with simple words: "Heavier than the nine tripods, the Ten-Thousand-Year Stone / Imperial command like thunder, how can it be taken lightly / Harmonious spirit in one mass, inexhaustible store / Sending off autumn and again welcoming spring" - Respectfully written by the old monk Takuan Soho, resident of the mountain.

Dharma Treasure Hall: {{Stores the complete Buddhist scriptures. Located north of the pond, it is one of the temple's ten scenic spots.}}

Abbot's Quarters: {{The paintings on the cedar doors and walls of the study, inner Buddha hall, corridors, etc. are by Kano Tan'yu, including Kamo horse racing, Nanto fire-wood Noh, and other human figures and flower-and-bird subjects.}}

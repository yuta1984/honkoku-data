Not yet accomplished, this year I investigate this without cease. Among those who study moral principles under the master, none surpasses me. The same is true regarding the venerable master. Therefore, not considering my crude inadequacy, I briefly record these rambling thoughts and compose this inscription:

The Void Hall flows correctly, entering the Land of the Rising Sun. Those who elucidate and proclaim it: Daiō Entsu
True heir and direct descendant, Daitō and Daigen. Opening the gate of skillful means, requiring diligent training
Passing through ten generations, the ancient mirror generates brilliant light. In the perfectly round ground, paths are cut off and people rare
The master knocked at that chamber, face to face they met. Charging towers and straddling hearths, magnificent great light
The Way spread across the four seas, his eye emptied all quarters. Saving all beings, a ship navigating the Eastern Sea
Holding up standards and layering regulations, true practice and actual realization. Vertical erasure and horizontal comprehension, thorny chestnuts and golden circles
Within one circular symbol, becoming the dot of the brush tip. His heroic bearing surpassed all groups, not stained by the finest dust
Deep talent gushing like a spring, smiling words warm as spring. Grasping the old fist carefully, great whiteness facing the eaves
Speaking and becoming clear, silent and making it profound. Shouldering the great dharma, supporting the fallen and maintaining the precarious
Sharp and steep transcendent function, one barrier for monks. On Ten Thousand Pines Peak, who dares to peer and climb?
In Mount Guye, discussing the mysterious with His Majesty. Auspicious clouds cover and shade
The pagoda called Jakunen (Tranquil Thus). Having already stilled illusory scenes, though called it does not return. The true body of suchness
Neither going nor coming. Creating this inscription, ashamed of my mediocrity. Virtue and achievements eternally remain
Heaven covers and earth bears

This is the inscription and preface for the Jakunen Pagoda at Shōun Zen Temple in Sennan, composed by Saigatsu Genryō, abbot and registrar of monks at Zuiryū-zan Daihei Kōkoku Nanzen Zen Temple, highest of the Five Mountains.

On the eleventh day of the twelfth month, winter of Hōreki 3 (1753), copied and erected below the Jiin Pagoda at Banshō-zan Tōkai Zen Temple. Current abbot Kanden Gimon respectfully inscribed.

Portrait of Founding Abbot Takuan (one scroll): In Shōhō 2 (1645), when the master was seventy-three years old, he commanded an artist to create a circular symbol and personally added one dot in its center, writing an inscription above it as a longevity portrait. There are two such scrolls: one kept at this temple, one stored at Nanshū Hermitage in Sennan. The inscription says:

An unnamed person told me: "I have obtained the master's true [image]. When I unroll and look at it, it is one circular symbol." This mountain hermit dotted one point and immediately wrote: "In ancient days, Gyōkō already burned six generations of circular symbols. Ryūtaku recorded ninety-nine on the azure sea. Frogs roll in mud and sand. Nansen once drew one circular symbol. Kiso sat within it. Makoku made a woman's bow. The Zhao bi originally had no flaw - like Xiangru, who carelessly [served] which Qin family? Now this circular symbol encompasses heaven and earth with nothing outside, exhausts dust-mote realms with no limit. Boundless worlds like wheat and beans. The sentient beings within like millet and hemp. The nine schools divide into sects and factions, the six arts arise building hedges and fences. Some争 argue about phoenix and qilin, others decide between dragons and snakes. People are extremely brilliant, yet also not insignificant. Bodhisattvas of the ten directions like ranked constellations, five hundred arhats emerging from clouds and mists. I become their master, establishing the dharma king. The dharmakaya's complete substance manifests to all people. Do you see me? Though sometimes in the middle, I do not wait for future Maitreya, nor long for past Śākyamuni. Ānanda destroys the jeweled canopy, Kāśyapa embraces the kaṣāya. Sōhō and the dhūta practices instead increase their reputation, King Ajātaśatru forgets to voice lamentations. Not revering Mañjuśrī, frequently calling the bath attendant to prepare tea and refreshments. Not looking toward Vimalakīrti, quickly summoning Tathāgata Kansu to serve gruel and tea. Lower realm śrāvakas attend my sandals, four-fruit sages drive my carriage. When spirited, adding more spirit - please observe how Yama's old man strains his eyes hoping to see me. The underworld officials dance with joy as if finding their father. I still ride the momentum, binding jailers, scattering shackles and chains, catching angry demons and making them bear iron fetters. Five-transgression beings rejoice in the wilderness, hell sinners gain their moment of pride. Joyfully, joyfully - in my place today all manner of things are already settled, medicines and illnesses mutually heal. Good monks! Just don't seek dharmas that have nothing good to obtain, don't abandon dharmas that have nothing to dislike. If you follow favorable and adverse [conditions], the path to your home mountain is still far. Alas! This dharma from the beginning cuts off all discrimination - even those correct in the mercury fall into partiality and heterodoxy. Buddhist scriptures, ancestral transmissions, recorded sayings - when examined in silence, they are flowers in empty space."

Shōhō 2 (1645), intercalary fifth month, seventh day
Former resident of Daitoku, seeing Tōkai, bhikṣu so-and-so, age seventy-three

Takuan's portrait is a circle encompassing all under heaven - nowhere hidden on the Tōkaidō road

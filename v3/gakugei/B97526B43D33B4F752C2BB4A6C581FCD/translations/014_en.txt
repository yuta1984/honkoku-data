Gozutennō Shrine is located on the left mountaintop outside the fence gate of Tōkai-ji Temple. It enshrines Shinmei-gū in a shared hall and serves as the tutelary deity of Kita-Shinagawa and the protective shrine of Tōkai-ji. It is an officially built shrine with temple lands, and the head priest is from the Koizumi family.

According to "Edo Meishō-shi," Gozutennō was enshrined by Ōta Dōkan at Shinagawa Castle during the Eikyō period. It is also called Susaki Myōjin or Shinagawa Myōjin. The festival is held annually on June 7th. The tutelary deity of Minami-Shinagawa is Kifune. Due to historical connections with this shrine, during festivals, the portable shrines of both shrines meet on bridges in the north and south post towns and then separate to the left and right. Therefore, this bridge is called "Yukiai-no-hashi" (Meeting Bridge). Until the 19th of the same month, a temporary shelter is built in the center of the Shinagawa post town highway to house the portable shrine.

Saka Inari is located in the back to the right of the main shrine. It may be named so because one descends a small slope to reach it. It is revered for its spiritual efficacy, with worshippers constantly visiting.

Kakinomoto Shin'ei-no-hi (Monument of Divine Poetry) is located on the left bank above the stone steps in front of the main shrine. A divine poem about Akashi Bay is carved on the stone surface, written in the authentic calligraphy of Shinkihaku Urabe Kaneo.

Goten-yama is the northern mountain continuation of the same location. It is called Goten-yama because there was a provincial palace here during the Keichō-Genna period. Local people traditionally say this was the former residence of Ōta Dōkan. This place is a hill overlooking the sea with thousands of steps of grassland. Especially around the Kanbun period, cherry saplings from Yoshino-yama in Yamato Province were planted, creating a magnificent spectacle in full bloom during spring. During the peak of the third lunar month's flowering, they rival clouds and scatter like snow.

The fragrance of flowers is carried far by the sea breeze, enveloping the sleeves of fishermen gathering seaweed. The spring breeze that encourages drinking before barrels doesn't rustle the branches, and the warbler's singing resembles a performance of great peace.

On September 16th, Kan'ei 17 (1640), when the Shogun went hunting here, he commanded Zen master Takuan to compose a waka poem at the palace:

"Regretting the evening's end, through the trees the gentle moon rises over the sea" - Takuan

When the moonlight reflected in the Shogun's cup, he requested another poem. The previous day it had rained, but that day cleared up beautifully:

"Even the falling rain seemed to wait for today, and my heart's patience in awaiting my lord was worthwhile" - Same

During the Kyōhō period, many sumac trees were planted. The autumn foliage also presents a unique spectacle.

Kanei-no-matsu (Bell Casting Pine) marks the location where Zōjō-ji's great bell was cast. This pine was planted as a marker of that spot and stands in a field to the north.

Montō Riverside, also called Mifune-ganki, is the eastern seashore of Shinjuku. According to tradition, during the Kan'ei period when the Shogun visited Tōkai-ji Temple, on his return journey, Zen master Takuan would see him off and come to this spot where they would engage in dialogue. Hence this name is said to derive from that custom.

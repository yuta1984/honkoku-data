Iso no Shimizu: Located in Shimizu Yokocho at the foot of Mount Goten. In ancient times, this area extended to the seashore. This well contains clear spring water that is said never to dry up, even during droughts. (According to some people, this is the remnant of where gravel was once excavated.)

Lamenting that the chaos affects even the boats, I composed this poem in pity:
　Tidal air swallows the beach, ten thousand acres connected　　Barbarian touch, no land not in turmoil
　The great castle daily works to plaster walls　　On horseback I chant, watching boats carry soil"

From the records of Monk Shingyō:
　Weeping, I arrived at the port called Shinagawa in Musashino, and began thinking about the return journey, but with the world's turmoil becoming ever worse, now...

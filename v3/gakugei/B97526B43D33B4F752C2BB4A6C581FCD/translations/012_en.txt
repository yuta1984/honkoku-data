Tomb of Master Nankaku (Located in the same egg-shaped pagoda area with family tombs built side by side. The master's family name was Hattori, his personal name was Genkyō, his courtesy name was Shisen, his common name was Koemon, and Nankaku was his literary name. His ancestors were one of the seven津島 clans of Owari Province, and his great-grandfather moved to Takashima in Etchū Province. His father's name was Genku, who moved to the capital. His mother was from the Yamamoto family. He was born in Tenna 3 (1683), came to Edo at age fourteen to study under Master Sorai, served the Yanagisawa lord after three years, retired after eighteen years of service, and died on the twenty-first day of the sixth month, summer of Hōreki 9 (1759) at the age of seventy-seven. The inscription on the tomb is omitted here. On the back of the monument it states: "Composed by Junior Fourth Rank Lower Grade Chamberlain Minamoto no Yoritoshi, respectfully inscribed by retainer Kō Genseki")

Spirit Shrine of Kamakura Gon-no-Gorō Kagemasa (Located on the mountain behind Shun'u-an hermitage at the same place. Its origins are unknown. This hermitage is the ancestral temple of the Toki family for generations, and the founding abbot Takuan was exiled to Kaminoyama in Ushū Province from Kan'ei 6 (1629) to Kan'ei 9 (1632), during which time the grass hut Shun'u-an was relocated here)

This temple is in a scenic area of Shinagawa, with green waters flowing gently in front of the gate, connecting the Shinagawa river to the sea. The blue mountains behind rise majestically with Gion shrines towering among the pines. The scenic beauty of dense forests, tall bamboo, wind-blown sails, and shore birds is beyond what words can describe. Particularly, the abbot's garden was designed by Lord Kobori Enshū and serves as a model for garden construction. Throughout the grounds, green pines and red maples intertwine their branches and leaves, creating an autumn spectacle like spread brocade. Always tranquil and serene, it is truly a great monastery that purifies the Zen mind.

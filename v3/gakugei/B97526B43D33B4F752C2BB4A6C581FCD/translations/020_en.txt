　What flows eastward is namely Shinagawa. Every year on the 7th day of the 6th month during the festival, the portable shrines of the northern and southern Gozu Tennō meet on this bridge. Therefore, the local people also call it "Yukiai-no-hashi" (the Bridge of Meeting).

Kifune Myōjin Shrine: Located on the southern bank of Naka-no-hashi (Middle Bridge) at the border between north and south Shinagawa post towns, to the right of the highway. In the shared hall, Shinmei and Gozu Tennō are worshipped together. It is the tutelary deity of South Shinagawa. Every year on the 7th day of the 6th month is the Tennō festival, and on the preceding day, the portable shrine is carried into the sea, and later a temporary shrine is erected in the post town where the divine procession takes place. The Kifune festival is held on the 9th day of the 9th month, and Shinmei on the 15th of the same month. The Suzuki family serves as the head priest.

Yoriki Myōjin Shrine: Located at Susaki in South Shinagawa. According to tradition, in the age of the gods long ago, when Princess Ototachibana was crossing this sea together with Prince Yamato Takeru in the imperial vessel, the ship capsized. The ship's timber drifted to various bays, and some also washed ashore at this place. The local people built a shrine and enshrined the spirit of Princess Ototachibana, naming it Yoriki Myōjin (also written as "Yoriki" meaning "drifted here"). Much later, Funatama Nishinomiya Taijin was added as a joint deity. In ancient times, when Minamoto no Yoshiie was heading east for the conquest of Ōshū, he stopped his horse at this place and asked fishermen about the history of this shrine.

When the jade bi was presented, the King of Qin examined it and said, "This is truly a peerless treasure of the realm," and accepted the jade, but said nothing about handing over the cities. Lin Xiangru approached and stepped forward, addressing the King of Qin: "Though this jade bi is beautiful, it has a slight flaw. Allow me to show this to Your Majesty." The King of Qin handed the jade bi to Lin Xiangru. Lin Xiangru took the jade and stepped back, leaning against a pillar in the hall. His hair stood on end with anger, pushing up his cap. Glaring at the King of Qin, he said: "Your Majesty sent a letter to our country saying you would give fifteen cities in exchange for the jade. Therefore, our king fasted for five days before sending the jade. When Your Majesty received me, you were extremely arrogant. Moreover, seeing that you had no intention of compensating with cities, I have taken back the jade bi. If Your Majesty threatens me with your authority, my head shall be smashed against this pillar together with the jade." The King of Qin, fearing the jade would be broken, apologized to Lin Xiangru, saying, "I was indeed wrong. I will certainly give the fifteen cities to Zhao."

Now if I am deceived by Your Majesty and return to Zhao, with what face could I meet my king? If Your Majesty truly wishes to obtain the jade bi, first give the cities to Zhao. Then why would the King of Zhao keep the jade and incur the wrath of a great nation?" The ministers of Qin were greatly angered and wanted to kill Lin Xiangru. The king said, "Even if we kill him, we still cannot obtain the jade bi. If we treat him generously and let him return, how could the King of Zhao deceive Qin over one jade bi?" Finally, Lin Xiangru was treated with honor and sent home. When Lin Xiangru returned to Zhao, the King of Zhao was greatly pleased and enfeoffed Lin Xiangru as Senior Grand Master.
Originally, this luminous jade bi was obtained long ago when there was a man of Chu named Bian He, who found a piece of uncut jade at Mount Jing in Chu and presented it to King Li of Chu. King Li had a jade craftsman examine it, who said it was not jade but stone. The king accused him of

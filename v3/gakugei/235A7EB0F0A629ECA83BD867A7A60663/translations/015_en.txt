Having no other option, they raised their voices and said "Please spare our lives!" Sun Bin immediately recited an incantation, and the sky cleared and the vegetation returned to normal. The two bandits knelt in apology and departed. Sun Bin again sensed that the bandits would come that night, so he used stones to arrange the Eight Formation. The two bandits came as expected and entered the stone formation but could not exit. Sun Bin again pardoned them. The next night when the bandits came again, Sun Bin had previously laid out ropes in a crisscross pattern, so the two bandits were caught in those ropes, entangled and toppled, unable to move their limbs, and finally submitted.

Sun Bin entered Wei and had an audience with King Hui. The king was pleased and appointed him as Grand Master of the Central Army, having him work alongside Pang Juan to establish hegemony. At this time, there was a great drought throughout the country, the vegetation withered and yellowed, and the people grieved and suffered. Since Bin had mastered the art of summoning wind and rain, Pang Juan petitioned the Wei king to have Sun Bin pray for rain.

The Wei soldiers consider themselves brave and always look down on Qi. Now we should win by appearing weak," and at night secretly feigned retreat. Pang Juan led his troops to storm the Qi camp and counted their cooking stoves - there were 100,000. Pang Juan said: "With 100,000 stoves, how can they maintain supply lines over long distances?" He rallied his troops and pursued urgently. The next day, Sun Bin retreated fifty li, made camp, built 50,000 stoves and departed. Pang Juan advanced and saw that the stoves had decreased, greatly rejoiced and said: "The Qi army fears us and more than half their soldiers have fled." He then abandoned the infantry, led the cavalry troops and advanced another day. Master Sun observed their movement

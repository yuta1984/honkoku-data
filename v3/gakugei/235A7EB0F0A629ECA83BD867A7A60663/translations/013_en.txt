Zhao Wuxu killed Zhibo and made his skull into a lacquered urinal.
Zhibo's retainer Yu Rang sought to avenge this, hiding a dagger in his robe and secretly entering Wuxu's palace. Disguising himself as a laborer, he used clay to plaster the walls of the toilet, intending to get close and stab him. Wuxu felt increasingly anxious and ordered an immediate search, discovering it was Yu Rang, Zhibo's retainer. The attendants wanted to kill him, but Wuxu said, "Zhibo died without descendants, yet this man seeks to avenge him. He is a true loyal retainer. I should respectfully avoid this" and ultimately pardoned him.

Wuxu's horse neighed sadly and backed away. Suspicious, Wuxu ordered a search and indeed Yu Rang was dragged out. Wuxu said, "I pardoned you before, and now this again. This time I cannot forgive you," and had his attendants surround him. Yu Rang said, "Now I will not greedily cling to life again. Please grant me your robe

The story of Sun Bin practicing magic arts, subduing bandits, praying for rain, and using strategy to defeat Pang Juan
Sun Bin was a descendant of Sun Wu (Sun Tzu). He once studied military strategy together with Pang Juan under Guiguzi of the Water Curtain Cave, becoming thoroughly versed in magic arts and military tactics. Pang Juan had already become a general of Wei. The King of Wei also summoned Sun Bin. Guiguzi told Sun Bin, "There is Pang Juan in Wei. You two cannot both stand together. I will remove disaster for you," and performed magic, giving him a brocade bag, saying "Open this in times of dire emergency." Sun Bin bowed farewell and descended the mountain. When he reached the foot of Black Sun Mountain, two bandits named Yuanda and Dugu Chen led dozens of thieves to block the road, demanding toll money, each drawing swords and spears to harm him. Sun Bin secretly practiced magic arts and spurred his horse into the forest. Where the two bandits advanced with their horses side by side, suddenly the sky darkened and the sun dimmed, all the trees transformed into soldiers, and war drums resonated through heaven. The bandit gang suffered and became confused.

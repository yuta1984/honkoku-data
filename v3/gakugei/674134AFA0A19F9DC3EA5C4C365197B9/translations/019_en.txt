Heavenly winds, blow shut the cloud pathways
that I might detain for a while
the form of this celestial maiden.

This is from the annual Toyoakari no sechie (Harvest Festival) held at the imperial court every November, when there was a dance called Gosechi no mai. Young daughters of court nobles and provincial governors were gorgeously adorned to perform this dance. This poem was composed upon seeing those dancing maidens.
Originally, this dance derives from when Emperor Tenmu was playing the koto at Nomiya and a heavenly maiden descended to dance. Therefore, likening these young girls to heavenly maidens, the poem means: "O heavenly winds, blow shut the pathways through the clouds, for when that beautiful celestial maiden finishes her dance she will surely return to heaven, so let me detain her and watch, if only for a little while."

From the peak of Mount Tsukuba
falls the Mina River—
so has my love accumulated
to become a deep pool.

This is a love poem composed and sent when the poet fell in love with Princess Tsuridono. The meaning is: the water that falls from the peak of Mount Tsukuba, though initially small, gradually accumulates to become the Mina River; similarly, the heart that suddenly began to feel love has gradually accumulated over the months to become as deep as a pool.
Both Mount Tsukuba and the Mina River are famous places in Hitachi Province.

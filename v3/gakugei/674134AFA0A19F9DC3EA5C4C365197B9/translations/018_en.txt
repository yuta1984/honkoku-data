Is this the place where those who go and those who return,
whether known or unknown, all must part—
the Barrier of Ōsaka?

This poem was composed when the poet built a hermitage near Ōsaka Barrier and observed the people coming and going. The meaning is that people leaving the capital, people returning to the capital, acquaintances and strangers alike all part ways at this barrier and then meet again here. Therefore, connecting with the name of this barrier called "Ōsaka" (Meeting Hill), he composed it as "au-saka" (meeting hill).
Ōsaka Barrier was an ancient checkpoint in the mountains between Kyoto and Ōtsu.

Tell the people that I have rowed out
across the vast ocean toward the eighty islands—
O fishing boat of the sea folk

This is a poem composed and sent to the people of the capital when he departed by boat from Naniwa Bay upon being exiled to Oki Island. The meaning is: "Tell the people of my household in the capital that I have sailed out across this boundlessly vast ocean toward the countless islands, O fishing boat of the sea folk." This "fishing boat of the sea folk" refers to the people who had accompanied him this far and were returning to the capital, and since it concerns coastal matters, he composed it by likening them to the fishing boats found there. Naniwa refers to present-day Osaka port. "Wada no hara" refers to the vast ocean.

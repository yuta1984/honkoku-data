Ninth Month (September)

Fujiwara no Okikaze
Looking at the color
of water falling
from the deep mountains,
I truly realize
autumn has reached its limit

Tenth Month (October)

Anonymous
Tatsuta River
weaves brocade—
in the godless month
using the autumn drizzle
as warp and weft

Eleventh Month (November)

Sakanoue no Korenori
White snow seems
to be accumulating
on Mount Yoshino—
my old village grows
ever colder

Twelfth Month (December)

Ariwara no Motokata
At the end
of this new year,
both the snow
and my own body
continue to pile up and age

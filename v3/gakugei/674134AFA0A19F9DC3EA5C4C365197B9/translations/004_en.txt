January
　　Ki no Tsurayuki
The water I cupped
　with my sleeves
　　　has frozen—
Will today's wind
　of spring's arrival
　　melt it away?

February
　　　　　　　Archbishop Henjō
Like pale green
　threads strung with white dew
That could be threaded
　　　like jewels—
　　　　the spring willow

March
　　　　Ariwara no Narihira
If you don't come today,
　tomorrow snow will
　　surely fall—
Even if it remains unmelted,
　might I mistake it for flowers?

April　　　　　　Anonymous
Remembering
　people of old
In the fragrance
　of orange blossoms,
　　waiting for May

May
In the thundering
　sky of
　　the May rains,
　　　　　
　　　cuckoo—
　　　　　
　　　what sorrow makes you　　Tsurayuki
　　　　　cry alone through the night?

June
　　　Mitsune
Where summer and autumn
　pass each other
　　　in the sky's
　pathway,
does a cool wind
　　　blow
　on one side?

July
　　　Tomonori
Searching for
　shallow places
　　　in the Milky Way,
　crossing
　　　　while
when the crossing
　　　is done,
　dawn has
　　　　broken

August　　Anonymous

Against white clouds,
　wings
　　　beating
　　and crossing,　
　　　　
　the flying geese—
even their number
　can be seen
　in the autumn
　　night moon

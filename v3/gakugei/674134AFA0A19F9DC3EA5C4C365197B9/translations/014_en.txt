Spring has passed and summer seems to have come—
white robes are being dried,
they say, on Mount Kagu of Heaven

The meaning of this poem is: Spring has passed and summer seems to have arrived. People say that clothes are being dried on Mount Kagu of Heaven in preparation for summer. This emperor resided at Fujiwara Palace in Yamato Province, and since Mount Kagu of Heaven was nearby, in early summer, clothes were hung to dry at houses around the mountain, which the courtiers probably reported to the emperor, inspiring this poem. It was customary to air clothes at the beginning of summer. "Shirotae" refers to white hemp cloth, used as a general term for such fabric.

On the trailing tail of the mountain bird
in the foothills—
like that long trailing tail,
this long night I sleep alone

This is a love poem, and its meaning is: Like the drooping tail of a mountain bird, through this long, long autumn night, I cannot sleep together with the one I love, but must sleep alone. How lonely and sad this is! "Ashibiki" is a makurakotoba (pillow word) for "mountain" and has no particular meaning of its own.

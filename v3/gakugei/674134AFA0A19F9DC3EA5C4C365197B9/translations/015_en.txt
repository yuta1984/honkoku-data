Going out to Tago Bay and looking,
white as pure silk,
snow keeps falling on Fuji's lofty peak

Going out to stand at Tago Bay and looking, snow falls pure white like white silk on the lofty peak of Mount Fuji—what a beautiful scene it is, with that high mountain. Tago Bay is in Suruga Province, at the seaside at the foot of the Fuji River. This poem was probably composed when the poet went out from his lodgings of the previous night to this bay and viewed Mount Fuji.

In the deep mountains, treading through fallen maple leaves,
when I hear the crying voice of deer,
autumn becomes most sorrowful

The heart of this poem is: All autumn scenery is melancholy, but among such scenes, in late autumn when the maple leaves have scattered thickly in the deep mountains, the time when one hears the voice of deer crying as they tread through those fallen leaves is truly the height of melancholy.

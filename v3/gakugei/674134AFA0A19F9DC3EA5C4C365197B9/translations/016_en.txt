Looking at the white frost
on the bridge built by magpies,
I realize the night has grown late

The magpie bridge originally exists in the Milky Way, where stars cross on Tanabata, but in this poem it is compared to the imperial bridge in the imperial palace. The imperial palace is called "above the clouds" for this reason. The heart of the poem is: seeing the white frost fallen on this imperial bridge, I realize how late the night has become. This poem was probably composed during night duty at the palace.

Looking far across the plains of heaven,
is that the same moon
that rose over Mount Mikasa
in Kasuga?

This poem was composed by Lord Nakamaro when he was sent to Tang China for study, as he viewed the moon from a beach in that land. The heart of the poem is: looking far across the vast sky, the moon rises beautifully from the sea. Is that moon the same moon that used to rise over Mount Mikasa when I was in Japan? Such thoughts naturally arise when one is in a distant place. Since the capital in Lord Nakamaro's time was in Nara, he was accustomed to seeing the moon rise over Mount Mikasa, which is why he composed this poem in this way.

Gon-Chūnagon (Provisional Middle Counselor) Teika is the son of Lord Shunzei. Born in the second year of Ōhō during the reign of Emperor Nijō (the seventh or eighth generation of emperors), he took Buddhist vows on the 11th day of the 12th month of the second year of Jōei, taking the name Myōjō. He later passed away on the 2nd day of the 8th month of the second year of Ninji at the age of eighty. He was also called Kyōgoku Kōmon, and held the title up to Lord Teika. While staying at his mountain villa in Ogura, he selected this Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets. These hundred poems emphasized substance (content) over ornamentation (flowery language), because he revered the true essence of waka poetry. Since it first appeared in the world during the time of his son Lord Tameie, people have continued to revere it to this day.

[First Poem]
Autumn rice fields' temporary hut, its rough thatch roof—
my sleeves grow wet with dew
as I keep watch

This poem was composed from the perspective of a humble man who builds a temporary hut by the rice fields in autumn to guard the crops. The meaning of the poem is: the hastily built hut in the autumn fields has a roof thatched with coarse straw matting, and because the weaving is rough, dew leaks through, so while my sleeves get wet, I spend sleepless nights in this hut keeping watch—what a hardship this is! "Koromode" refers to the sleeves. "Kariho no io" is a case of word repetition, similar to the "no" in "Tsukuba-ne no mine."

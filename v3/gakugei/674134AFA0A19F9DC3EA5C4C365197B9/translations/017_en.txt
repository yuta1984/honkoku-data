My humble dwelling is in the southeastern direction from the capital—
thus I live quietly, yet people say I am Mount Uji to the world

The heart of the poem is:
My hermitage is on Mount Uji in the southeastern direction from the capital, and as I live quietly in seclusion like this, people in the world say that Kisen regards the world as sorrowful and has retreated from it. This uses a play on words with "yo wo uki" (the world as sorrowful).

The color of the flowers has faded—
in vain, while I gazed lost in thought
as I spent my time in this world

This expresses how, while spending days in vain, lost in various worldly sorrows, and with long rains falling, the cherry blossoms' color deteriorated without my having seen them even once—what a regrettable thing. "Utsuru" refers to anything changing color. "Itazura ni" means the same as "in vain" or "uselessly." "Nagame" refers to gazing at the sky while lost in melancholy thoughts. Since long rains are also called "nagame," this poem combines both "spending time in this world" and the spring rains.

The Tama River has wide, open sandy areas, and its flow is not consistent. In many cases, especially after rainfall, the ferry crossings shift and are never fixed in one place. To the northwest, one can see the mountains of Chichibu and various peaks of Koshu Province, while to the southeast, embankments extend diagonally. Ayu (sweetfish) are the specialty of this river. They are abundant during summer and autumn. Therefore, fishermen are always present without interruption.

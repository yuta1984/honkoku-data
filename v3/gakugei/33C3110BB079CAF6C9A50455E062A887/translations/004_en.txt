Outside the sacred trees beyond the Zuishin Gate of this shrine, cormorants, herons, and various other waterfowl build their nests and dwell there. Daily they fly from the seashores of Shinagawa and elsewhere to their nests to raise their young. However, not even a single bird enters beyond the Zuishin Gate, which is considered one of the seven wonders of this shrine. During the cold season, not one bird roosts there, but they return again to nest when the cold season ends the following year.

According to the same document: "On the 24th day of the 2nd month of Kanki 4 (1232), there was damage to the worship hall of Rokusho-no-miya in Musashi Province, and repairs were undertaken. Musashi Saemon-no-jō Sukeyori served as the magistrate."

Honji-dō Hall: Located to the left of the main shrine, it enshrines Śākyamuni Buddha as the central deity, with Shō-Kannon and Jizō on either side. It is managed by six temple-monks. During annual regular ceremonies, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra is chanted at the worship hall, and Buddhist services are also performed at this hall.

Mikoshi Storehouse: Located in the same row, it houses eight portable shrines. Among them, there is one that belongs to two deities, so it is not nine shrines in total. This is kept secret as a deity of the shrine officials.

Iron Statue of Amida Buddha: Standing in the same row, it is a seated statue approximately seven feet tall. A temporary rain shelter has been built above it. There is an inscription on the shoulder of the statue with characters cast in high relief. The same style of characters reading "Fujiwara-shi" are cast on the knee in two places. According to local legend, "Long ago, Chichibu-no-shōji Shigetada had this made for the salvation of his beloved courtesan," and it was originally located in what is now called Amida-saka in the former Koigakubo village before being moved here. However, this is a false tale. By reading the inscription given below, one can know that it was not created by Shigetada. Shigetada was executed at Futamata River in Musashi Province in Genkyū 2 (1205). Kenchō 5 (1253) is forty-eight years after Genkyū 2. This serves as proof. Another theory states that "this bronze statue was originally enshrined at the provincial temple of this province, was once stolen by thieves, and was abandoned at this place, which is why it is enshrined here." The inscription reads as follows:

Great Promoter Nen-Amida-butsu Myōren Daishi Fujiwara-no-Sukechika
This vow is for the equal benefit of departed parents, Gyōgan [?] and new novices, extending to all sentient beings in the dharma realm. We respectfully cast this Buddha statue of one jō and two shaku.

Goma Hall: Located in the same row, it enshrines a statue of Fudō Myōō. It is managed by the temple-monk Myōō-in.

Gokū-sho (Offering Hall): Located to the front right of the main shrine.

Tōshō Daigongen Shrine: Seated to the right of the main shrine. Said to have been established in Genna 4, Year of the Earth Horse (1618).

Sacred Rope Tree: Located in the verdant forest behind the main shrine. It is a dead stump of a zelkova tree with a circumference of several tens of units. This has been passed down through tradition.

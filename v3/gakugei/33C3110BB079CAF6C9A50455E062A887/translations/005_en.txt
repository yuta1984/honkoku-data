According to tradition, in ancient times when the provincial governor (kuni-no-miyatsuko) made shrine visits from this location, there were gates here, so sacred rope was stretched across, which is why it came to be called by this name.

Zuishin Gate: Wooden statues of Kushiiwa-mato-no-mikoto and Toyoiwa-mato-no-mikoto are enshrined here.

Miya-no-me Shrine: Located in the forest to the front left of the Zuishin Gate. The deities enshrined are Suseri-hime-no-mikoto, Kushiinada-hime-no-mikoto, and Konohana-sakuya-hime-no-mikoto - three goddesses who are the consort deities of the main shrine. Every year on July 12th and 13th, Shinto priests from nearby villages gather to perform sacred music (kagura) in front of the shrine. Long ago, during the Kamakura period, this ceremony began to be performed following an order from Lord Yoritomo. Lord Yoritomo's written order was lost in the fires of war during the Tenshō era.

Horse Training Grounds: Located outside the forests on the left and right within the second torii gate. The eastern track is called "sen-ba" (slender horse track) and the western track is called "kake-ba" (galloping track). Also, across the Kōshū Highway to the north, within the first torii gate on both left and right sides, there are two more horse tracks. After donations were made following the victory at Osaka during the Keichō era, much of the land of the sen-ba and kake-ba tracks became residences for shrine officials in later generations, with only traces of their original form remaining. However, the land of these tracks is said to be historic sites where horses from the imperial pastures were once selected.

Horse Market: It customarily begins on May 3rd each year and ends on the last day of September. Warning signs are erected beside the main road in front of the shrine. The horse market at this location dates back to when the provincial governor was in office - every year they would select the best 25 horses from the imperial pastures to present to the Imperial Palace. Later, horses brought from various provinces were gathered for people to trade. This horse market was discontinued during the Kyōhō era and subsequently moved to two locations: Yabu-no-uchi in Asakusa, Edo, and Azabu-jūban. However, since this was an auspicious imperial horse market, even now the Edo horse magistrates Takagi Gen'bei and Yamamoto Denzaemon visit this shrine annually, ride the imperial horses provided at this horse ground following the old customs, then respectfully seat them within the shrine grounds and visit Tōshō Daigongen Shrine.

Notice Board: Located at the entrance to the main road in front of the shrine, said to have been erected during the Keichō era.

Horse Racing: Every year on the night of May 3rd, on the main road of Banbashuku, Fuchū, along the Kōshū Highway in front of the sacred temporary shrine (otabisho) of Rokusho-no-miya, twelve horsemen ride their steeds in competition in the darkness after extinguishing all lights. On this night, members of the shrine families serve as inspectors, waiting in temporary shelters beside the otabisho.

Sacred Music (Kagura): Performed in the worship hall on the 4th of the same month.

Great Divine Ceremony: Performed on the 5th of the same month. Since this is the auspicious day when the deities of this shrine first appeared and were enshrined, the Shinto priests, with particular reverence and awe, go to the seashore at Shinagawa on April 25th for purification rituals, and from that day observe abstinence and enter into ritual seclusion. On the day itself, kagura is performed all day long. At dusk, all shrine families gather at the head priest's residence. Afterward they go to the divine hall, offer the great prayer of divine courage, extinguish all lights, and in darkness respectfully transfer the portable shrines. Of the eight mikoshi, seven are carried westward along the main Kōshū Highway from in front of the second torii, while one branches left from in front of the Zuishin Gate, exits via Fuchū Honchō, and together they are all transferred to the otabisho at Kakufuda-tsuji in Banbashuku. During this time, shrine family members ride horses to Tsubo-no-miya enshrined at Shimokawara, perform secret rituals offering sacred wands, return to enter the otabisho, and conduct offering ceremonies. After the rituals end, they go to a temporary shelter set up at the house of a farmer named Noguchi of the Saruwatari clan of head priests, and perform ancient celebratory rites. According to tradition, this house called Noguchi is where Ōnamuchi-no-mikoto first stayed for one night when he initially appeared in ancient times. Another farming family called Okano closed their doors that night and remained in deep reverent seclusion.

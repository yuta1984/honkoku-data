The shogunal house also bestowed direct written orders with official seals. Particularly as it was the provincial grand shrine, during the Keichō era, Iwami-no-kami Ōkubo had the shrine hall rebuilt and included it in the national ritual calendar. He also issued orders establishing regulations for the horse market. Later, in Shōhō 3, a fire broke out from Fuchū Honmachi and completely burned everything up to the shrine's sacred lands. Therefore, in Kanbun 7 (year of hinoto-hitsuji), Yamato-no-kami Kuze Hiroyuki was appointed as construction supervisor and the shrine was rebuilt.

(According to shrine records written in Kan'ei 1, the head priest Saruwatari Mikawa-no-kami Fujiwara no Morimasa was besieged in Hachiōji Castle for Hōjō Mutsu-no-kami Ujiteru during the Tenshō era. When this castle fell, Morimichi died in battle here. Also due to this war fire disaster, the entire shrine was reduced to ashes. Therefore, all the successive shogunal certificates and treasured sacred objects were completely lost.)

Rokushō-miya Otabisho (Temporary Shrine)  Located about one and a half chō west of Rokushō Myōjin, in the middle of Fuchū Banba-juku, beside the crossroads called Fuda-no-tsuji on the road to Sagami Highway. Every year on May 5th during the grand festival, the portable shrine of Rokushō-miya is transferred here that night. The ceremony is detailed in the previous section.

field. To the east it extends far into the distance with an unclear view. To the south, across the Tama River flow, short pines can be seen standing on Nagaoka hill - this is what is commonly called Mukō-ga-oka. To the north of this land is Fuchū's post station, where Rokushō's grove of trees grows luxuriantly. (The procedure for the sacred rice planting ceremony is detailed under Rokushō-miya's annual events mentioned earlier)

Hongaku-zan Myōkō-in  Called Shinnyo-ji temple. Located on a small street south of Fuchū Honmachi. It belongs to the Shingi Shingon sect under the Kyoto Ninna-ji monzeki. During Emperor Seiwa's reign, in the first year of Jōgan era, it was founded by Jisai Sōjō at the request of Prince Shinnyo. It enshrines as its main deity a Jizō Bodhisattva carved by Master Gyōki (5 sun 5 bu in height), and was granted some rice fields. However, the temple suffered greatly from repeated war fires and fell into ruin, but in Eikyō 11 (year of tsuchi-no-to-hitsuji), Hōin Yūgen (who died on the 24th day of the 7th month of Chōroku 3, year of tsuchi-no-to-u) rebuilt it and became the temple's restoration founder. (In Tenshō 19, year of kanoto-u, temple lands were granted by the current house) The three large characters "Shinnyo-ji" on the nageshi plaque in the main hall were written by Shōsen-in Sōjō Nikkō, the "Hongaku-zan" plaque hung in the worship hall was written by the monk Jōchin of Nanzan, and the "Hongaku-zan" plaque at the rear gate was

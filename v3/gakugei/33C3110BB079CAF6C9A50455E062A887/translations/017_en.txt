According to the shrine records, the deity of this shrine was originally Seoritsu-hime alone, but later Shitaharu-no-mikoto from Ichinomiya was transferred here, and Uka-no-mitama-no-mikoto was enshrined as well, making Ono Shrine a shrine of three deities. The period when this occurred is unclear, but being the most ancient shrine, in the fifth year of Emperor Seimu, year of kinoto-i, autumn, when an imperial decree was issued to establish provincial governors in all provinces, Etakemohi-no-mikoto also received the imperial command and came to this land as provincial governor of this province, establishing his seat in Ono County. After this, veneration became deep, and the deity of this shrine was again transferred to the auxiliary hall of Rokushō Shrine. 《What is called "Kyakurai Sansho" (Three Visiting Deities) at Rokushō Shrine refers to this. Though Shitaharu-no-mikoto was a deity transferred later, it seems this deity was especially revered and worshipped》
《At Rokushō Shrine as well, among the Three Visiting Deities, Shitaharu-no-mikoto is considered first》 Due to this history, only a single thatched shrine building remains to mark the old site, but one can truly imagine the thousand-year past.

This is an old custom. This house is said to maintain the ancient precedent from when Ōnamuchi-no-mikoto appeared and sought lodging, but they declined due to some concern about the family being in a state of ritual impurity, and they continue this practice unchanged. After all the divine ceremonies and old customs at the otabisho were completed, the negi priests returned to the main shrine and made preparations for the return procession. The head priest rides the sacred horse and performs yabusame (horseback archery) in front of the otabisho. When this ends and drums are beaten, all lights are lit simultaneously from the shrine buildings to the market stalls. This is most striking compared to the previous darkness. With the head priest leading on horseback, during the return procession, bonfires are lit at four locations: on the left and right of the second torii, in front of the main shrine, in front of the Zuishin Gate, and toward the western horse grounds at Kakeba, making it bright as daylight. The many lanterns illuminating the road for the mikoshi procession create a truly magnificent spectacle.

Rice Planting Ceremony: Performed on the 6th of the same month. This takes place in the rice fields to the south, about a hundred steps behind the shrine. On this day, people of the province visit the shrine and pray that the abundant harvest of the sacred fields will extend to their own lives. They bring rice seedlings, gather in the fields, finish planting in one morning, then engage in dancing or sumo wrestling with great enthusiasm. Although the seedlings become completely submerged in mud, by the next morning they spring up vigorously. Even when different varieties are planted, they ultimately produce similar grain, and while there may be differences in growth timing, there is never a year without good harvest, and there are no disasters from floods, droughts, or insect damage. This is popularly considered one of the seven wonders of this shrine.

National Peace Ceremony: Performed on June 20th. Millet rice is offered and kagura is performed. This commemorates the victory of Lords Yoriyoshi and Yoshiie when they departed for the northern provinces on June 20th of Kōhei 5 (1062).

Small Festival: Performed on July 7th. It is commonly called the Katahira Festival or Katahira Market because in ancient times this area's main industry was producing hemp cloth. At that time, provincial governors who came to this province would select the best to tribute to the capital, and the remainder would be traded at this location. Since July 7th was especially favored for this, it received this name.

National Peace Ceremony: Performed over two days, July 12th and 13th, with kagura performed at both Miya-no-me Shrine and the main shrine. Details are provided in the previous section on Miya-no-me Shrine.

Rice Field Ceremony: On August 1st, kagura is performed all day. Worshippers pray for that year's abundant harvest. Sumo wrestling is held on this day. There are many other festival ceremonies throughout the season, but there is no time to list them all, so only the major ones are recorded here.

The shrine record states: "On May 5th of the 41st year of Emperor Keikō (111 CE), the cyclical year Xinhai, Ōnamuchi-no-mikoto appeared in this Ono County..."

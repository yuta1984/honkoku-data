The learned monk Ken Ajari conspired with Inage Saburo Shigenari, the lord of this land, to establish this temple mountain and enshrine this sacred statue in a Buddhist temple. Later, there was veneration from Lady Hojo Masako, and around that time, Minamoto no Yoritomo also donated land in Koma District of this province as funds for incense and flowers. In the 8th year of Kenkyu, year of the Fire Snake (1197), Lord Yoritomo visited this temple. Also in the 2nd year of Kogen, year of the Fire Dragon (1257), the fifth month, the temple hall was rebuilt for the spiritual benefit of Lords Yoritsugu and Yoritsune, making it a great temple complex. However, it was destroyed during the military conflicts of Shokyo and Kenmu periods (1331-1336), and afterwards never returned to its former scale. Two items - armor and helmet, and a small desk of Chinese wood - are said to be donations from Lord Yoritomo and are kept as treasures of this temple.

The plaque reading "Mui-shin" (Mind of Non-Action) in the study hall was written by Sasaki Genryū, with calligraphy by Ten'i. The Kannon Hall is located on the mountain to the left of the gate entrance. The plaque reading "Taihiden" (Hall of Great Compassion) is said to be written by the great priest Sōzen Kakugan. The principal image, an eleven-faced Kannon statue, measures 2 shaku 5 sun (about 76cm) in height and is attributed to Prince Shōtoku.

The temple's treasures include two letters from Hōjō Ujiteru. Additionally, there is a hanging scroll depicting herons among reeds, painted by an imperial hand, and a five-条 kesa (Buddhist robe) embroidered with peonies, Chinese grass patterns, and fans, both bestowed by the Tokugawa family.

An ancient chime, one piece 《Chinese-made with beautiful bronze coloring. The stand is said to have been made by Hidari Jingorō》

Eikōzan Anyō-ji Temple: Located in the same row as Myōkō-in, separated by a southern lane. 《The local name of this area is called Yanosaki》 It belongs to the Tendai sect and is affiliated with Chōraku-ji in Serada, Jōshū Province. The principal image, Amida Nyorai, is a seated statue about 1 shaku 6 sun (48cm) tall; the sculptor is unknown. During the Einin period (1293-1299), the monk Sonkai became the restoring founder. Recent earthquake disasters caused the loss of old records.

Site of the Former Residence of Etakehi-no-mikoto, Provincial Governor of Musashi: Refers to the hill in front of Myōkō-in. In ancient times, this was the site of the provincial governor's residence. After the Tokugawa entry into the region, a villa for agricultural inspection was built on this historic site.

The shōgun frequently visited here, but on the 12th day of the 10th month of Shōhō 3 (1646), a fire broke out from Fuchū's main street and this villa burned down. Since there was no reconstruction afterward, during the Kyōhō period (1716-1736), it was granted to local residents upon their request and converted to farmland. Therefore, local people call it "Goten-chi" (Palace Grounds). The view from this location is exceptionally fine.

《Note: Provincial governors (kuni no miyatsuko) were established when Emperor Jinmu established his capital at Kashihara in Yamato Province and ascended the throne. He appointed governors for Katsuragi Province and granted the title of provincial governor to other meritorious individuals, also establishing county chiefs. From then on, they were appointed generation after generation. Until the Wadō period, there were 144 provincial governors in total. In the early imperial court period, there were 144 provinces, each with one provincial governor who managed Shinto rituals while also governing civil affairs. 《After Emperor Saga, various provinces were divided, merged, or abolished, resulting in 66 provinces plus the two islands of Iki and Tsushima, making 68 provinces total》 According to the Nihon Shoki, during Emperor Nintoku's reign there was a governor of Tōtōmi Province, and during Emperor Sushun's reign there was a governor of Kawachi Province. Prince Shōtoku's constitution also mentions provincial governors and governors. The Tenmu Chronicles mention various provincial governors, governors, district officials, and common people, so later provincial officials were also appointed. Provincial officials held higher rank and greater authority than provincial governors, so they were referred to in order as "provincial officials and provincial governors." From then on, various national histories often recorded matters of provincial officials and governors, but there is no record of when the provincial governor system was abolished; it seems to have gradually fallen into disuse.》

Koremasa Village: Located on the northern bank of the Tama River, south of Fuchū. Among the village officials here is a person from the Ida family. According to their family genealogy, their ancestor was a descendant of Ida Shirō Shigemasa, the fourth son of Hatakeyama Shōji Shigetada, and they are descendants of Ida Settsu-no-kami Koremasa, a retainer of the Odawara Hōjō family. When Odawara fell in Tenshō 18 (1590) and Hachiōji Castle was defeated, they settled in this area. Hence the name Koremasa Village.

Ichinomiya Daimyōjin Shrine Located in Ichinomiya Village on the south bank of the Tama River, fifteen to sixteen chō north of Mokusa Hachiman Shrine (separated by more than one ri southwest from Rokushō Shrine). The shrine priests from both the Nitta and Ōta families serve in worship. The enshrined deity is Amanoshitaharu-no-mikoto. Later, Seoritsu-hime and Inakura-mitama Ōkami were enshrined together, making it three deities in one shrine with three doors (the enshrined deities are now the same as at Ono Shrine). In the "Kushi Honki," it states that when Nigihayahi-no-mikoto (the child of Ama-no-oshi-homimi-no-mikoto of the second generation of earthly deities) descended to this land of Ashihara-no-nakatsu-kuni, thirty-two deities accompanied him as assistants, and these were divided among thirty-two provinces. At that time, Ama-no-uwaharu-no-mikoto descended to Shinano Province, and Amanoshitaharu-no-mikoto descended to Musashi Province to open the land.

(According to the shrine priests' tradition, whether Shitaharu-no-mikoto of this shrine remained at this location in the age of the gods, or whether the kunitsu-kami later enshrined him because he was the ancestral deity of the province, cannot be known today. According to shrine tradition, when Ichinomiya's Shitaharu-no-mikoto was transferred to Ono Shrine in Onomiya Village and Inakura-mitama-no-mikoto was enshrined alongside, making Ono Shrine a three-deity shrine, the exact period is unclear. However, during the reign of Emperor Seimu, after Provincial Governor Etakehi-no-mikoto established his seat in the Tama region of Musashi Province, since Ichinomiya was the ancestral deity of the province's founding and Onomiya was an old shrine of the same region, the provincial governor revered them and together with Inakura-mitama-no-mikoto moved them again to the auxiliary halls of Rokushō Shrine, establishing the protocol of a provincial shrine for their worship. Also, every year on the fifth day of the fifth month during the great festival of Rokushō Shrine, the shrine priests of this shrine go to Fuchū to serve the portable shrines of the three locations - Ichinomiya and Ono - and carry the sacred offerings presented at the temporary shrine. When the portable shrines return to their shrines, they also serve them to Rokushō Shrine, and after the divine service ends, they guard those sacred offerings and return directly to Ichinomiya, storing them in the inner sanctuary of this shrine and making offerings of rice and performing ritual worship as the old protocol, because this was the original shrine.)

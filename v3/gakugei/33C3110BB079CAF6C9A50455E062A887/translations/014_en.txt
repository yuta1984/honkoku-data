Higan-zan Zenmyō-ji Temple: Also called En'yō-in. Located on the right side of the road from Fuchū Honmachi to Sekido. 《This is the Sagami Highway, the ancient Kamakura road》 It is a Tendai Ritsu temple belonging to Jōmyō-in. The principal image enshrined is Amida Nyorai. It is a seated statue measuring 1 jō 6 shaku (about 4.8m) tall. 《Inside the statue is enshrined an Amida Nyorai image carved by Jikaku Daishi》 The founding date is ancient, but in the medieval period the temple fell into ruin and lost its records. However, recently Hen-mui Gedatsu Koji 《whose secular name was Yoda Iori Teishige》 restored the temple, making the monk Shōkai the restoring founder and donating fields and other lands. Therefore, there is a portrait of the lay devotee. 《It is an image in court dress. Beside it is also an image of his disciple Shōkai》 The plaque in the inner sanctuary reading "Hinizō" is the authentic calligraphy of Quasi-Empress Consort Prince Kōson Hōshin'ō. Gedatsu Koji's grave is behind the hall. The Higan-zan Library is to the right of the main hall. The books stored in the library are Gedatsu Koji's collection, totaling 122 boxes. 《There is one volume cataloging the books stored in this library》

Tsubo Shrine: Located about four chō southwest in the same area, on farmland at Shimokawara. This shrine is said to be the sacred shrine of the provincial governor (kuni no miyatsuko). Now only a small thatched shrine remains, but every year on May 5th during the grand festival of Rokushō Shrine, it is an old custom to send an offering messenger from this shrine to Rokushō Shrine, with the Shinto priest of Rokushō Shrine riding a horse to perform this duty.

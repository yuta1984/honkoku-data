Banshō-gayatsu (Carpenter's Valley) (Refers to a valley about one chō to the west. This too is said to have been the place where carpenters carved and shaped wood when Sueshige built the hall)

Wakatabi Myōjin (Wakatabi Deity) - Located about three chō to the east of Kongō-ji Temple in Wakatabi Village, this serves as the tutelary deity of this land. It is a shrine served by Kongō-ji Temple. According to tradition, after the mysterious monk who carved the two attendant boys flanking the principal image of Fudō Myōō at Kongō-ji Temple finished creating the statues, he was about to depart. The monks and laypeople of the vicinity, overcome with joy, followed in his footsteps and came to this place, but the said mysterious monk suddenly disappeared from sight. People of high and low rank found this wondrous and built a shrine at this location, calling it Wakatabi Myōjin. The place name is also called Wakatabi Village.

Tomb of Taira no Koremori - Located about one chō to the southwest of Kongō-ji Temple, in Taira Village (adjacent to Hirayama Village), within the compound of a farmer named Mataemon. It is a single piece of blue slate stone, over seven shaku and five sun in height, about two shaku in width, and about two sun in thickness. At the top is carved the Sanskrit character "hrīḥ" (kiriku), and below it reads "Bun'ei 8th year, year of the metal sheep, mid-winter day." Local people have traditionally said this is the monument of Taira no Koremori. In ancient times, a warrior named Taira no Suketsuna lived in this area, and being a distant descendant of the Taira clan, he may have erected this to pray for Koremori's salvation (though the chronology is most suspicious). Others also say it might be Suketsuna's grave. About two chō to the south, toward the mountain...

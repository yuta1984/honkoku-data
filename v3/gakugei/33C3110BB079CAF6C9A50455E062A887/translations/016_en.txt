Therefore it is called by this name.

Ono-no-miya Village: The area northeast of Bunbai across the Jin Highway is called this. 《Within Fuchū Hon-shuku》
《Even an area with only about thirty houses is called Ono-no-miya》 Ono is a name from ancient times before counties and villages were established, and this is what was called Ono-no-agata (Ono County). Now it has become the old name of Fuchū. The Wamyō Ruijushō lists "Ono (乎乃)" under Tama County. 《This land became cultivated fields around the Genki-Tenshō period, and the cultivated fields of Ono-no-miya are referred to as Mukaida farmland》
《At the beginning of development there were only about five tan of fields, so local people called it Gotanda (Five-Tan Fields). Also, the mound among the northern fields of Ono-no-miya was a one-ri marker on the medieval Kōshū Highway from Fuchū to Hino, and even now that country path is called the Old Highway》

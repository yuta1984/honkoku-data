○Han (ridge) is the boundary of rice fields. It is read as "kuro" or "aze." Also, sho (kuro) and sho (ase) are the same. In the country of Zhou, it is said that those who cultivate yield the ridge.
○Mizo (ditch) is the waterway between rice fields. Ko (ditch) means ko (structure). It is constructed crossing lengthwise and widthwise. Kyo (canal) is the same.
○Hitotsuhashi (single-log bridge) is also called dokubokiryo (single-wood bridge). It is also called kokyo (solitary bridge). It is called maruki bridge (round-log bridge) or ippon bridge (single-log bridge).
○Tsuka (mound): flat ones are called bo (grave), and those with piled earth are called cho (mound). Particularly high ones are called fun (tumulus). All are tsuka. Trees are planted on top of mounds as markers.

Building up earth is called dan (platform), and clearing ground is called cho (place). It is a place for worshipping gods. The place where farmers process rice and grains is called jo (place). It is also called "hoshiba" (drying place). There are ichiba (market) and uriba (sales place). It can also be written as "ba."
○Sei (well) was first created by a person called Hakueki. Chin is a poisonous bird. When its feathers fall into a well and people drink that water, they die. Therefore, paulownia trees are planted near wells. The chin fears the phoenix. Since phoenixes live in paulownia trees, this is to make the chin fear the presence of phoenixes.
○Kan refers to seien (well enclosure). Commonly called "igetaidzutsu." Writing it as "idzutsu" is incorrect. Bamboo should be planted beside the kan (well frame). Phoenixes eat bamboo seeds.

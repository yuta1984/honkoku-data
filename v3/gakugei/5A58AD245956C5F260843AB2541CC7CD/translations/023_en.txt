○Doors (to): Single-panel hinged gates are called "to" (doors). Also, the interior is called "to" and the exterior is called "mon" (gate). When private houses are lined up in rows, this is called "henko" (row houses).
○Roof tiles (kawara): These were first made by a person named Kongo during China's Xia Dynasty. Female tiles are called "han." Male tiles are called "tō." There is also a legend that Emperor Wen of Wei dreamed of throwing tiles that became mandarin ducks, hence the term "en'ō-gawara" (mandarin duck tiles).
○Frog-leg brackets (kaeru-mata): These are located under the bracket complexes. They are so named because they resemble a frog's legs. Since frogs live in water, these serve to ward off fire disasters. "Kamoi" (door header) has the same meaning.
○Bedchambers (gafubō): Also called sleeping quarters or private chambers. The emperor's sleeping quarters are called "yon-no-otodo" (night palace).

○Door bars (kan-no-ki): These are crossbars that secure gates. What we now call "kan-no-ki." "Sen" and "sen" are the same thing.
○Door bolts (tozashi): These are latches that close from the outside. Also the ring handles on top of gate doors. Also the wood for gate latches - either wooden bars or chains.
○Door knockers (hoshū): In my current understanding, these are ring handles for doors, sliding doors, or paper screens. "Chū" refers to pull rings.
○Walls (kabe): Castle walls are called "rui." White walls are called "funpeki." There are also painted walls and board walls. These serve as room partitions.
○Government offices (mandokoro): Places where government affairs are conducted. Where the kebiishi (imperial police) are stationed. Places where public matters and lawsuits are adjudicated. Same as "chō" (office).
○Stables (umaya): Horse shelters. Since an alternative name for monkeys is "bafū" (horse father), monkeys are kept in stables

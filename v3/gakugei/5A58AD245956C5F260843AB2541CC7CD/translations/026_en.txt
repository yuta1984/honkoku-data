Neck shackles are sometimes called "kō" (crossbeams). Also, racks for hanging clothes are called "ikō" (clothing racks). Du Fu composed in his poetry "kingfishers cry at the clothing rack."

○Rafters (taruki) are also written as "en." In China during the Qin period they were called "en," during the Zhou period "sai," and during the Qi period "kaku."

○Coffered ceilings (sōsei) are ceilings. They are called sōsei because aquatic plants are painted on them. Both "sō" (aquatic plants) and "sei" (well) come from the desire to ward off fire disasters. Writing it as "tenjō" (heaven's well) also carries this meaning - all taking associations with water.

○Kilns (kawarakama) are tile kilns. These are kilns for firing tiles. "Yō" means the same thing. Tiles are placed inside these kilns and fired by smoking with brushwood. Charcoal kilns are of the same type.

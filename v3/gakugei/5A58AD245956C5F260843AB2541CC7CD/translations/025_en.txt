are called "dai" (platform). Building a structure on top of a platform is called "taimon" (platform gate). Also called "rōdai" (tower platform), "butai" (stage), "kadai" (song platform), or "utena."
○Turrets (yagura): These are watchtowers on castle tops. Arrow slits are opened to observe enemy numbers and positions, and to shoot arrows and firearms from. Also called "senpō" (battle platforms).
○Viewing stands (sajiki): Platforms for spectators. One should not say "strike" or "hang" sajiki. One should say "construct" sajiki.
○Kemari courts (shūkiku no tsubo): Playing fields for kemari (kickball). Called "yonhon-gakari" because pine, bamboo, cherry, and maple trees are planted at the four corners. The ball was made to resemble the head of Chiyou from China.

○Rotating sutra repositories (rinzō): Repositories for storing the complete Buddhist canon. Made to rotate, hence called rinzō, tenzō, or kyōzō. The principle is that rotating the repository once is equivalent to reciting the entire canon. The figure in front is a person called Fu Dashi, who protected the complete canon during Buddha's lifetime.
○Onion-shaped finials (gokyū): What we now call "gibōshi" (ornamental bulbs). Found on bridges or balustrades.
○Bracket arms (hijiki): Commonly written as "arm wood." Called "cloud arm wood" because cloud shapes are carved on them. Curved bracket arms are also called "kyō" or "ran." These are the wooden supports that bear the bracket blocks.
○Bracket blocks (masugata): Square brackets on top of pillars. Also called "hōto," "kyōto," "seuto," or "hakuro."
○Crossbeams (keta): Horizontal timbers of houses. Also leg shackles

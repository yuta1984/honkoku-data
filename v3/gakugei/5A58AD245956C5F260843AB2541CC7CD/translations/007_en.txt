This is also called kōden (skill begging) or Tanabata festival.

○The Milky Way is also called Tenga (Heavenly River) or Ginga (Silver River). On Tanabata, magpies spread their wings to form a bridge, allowing the two stars Kengyū and Shokujo to cross this river and meet.

○Bokusei (comet) is an inauspicious star. When this star appears, there are omens of removing the old and adopting the new, or being struck by fire disasters. This is commonly called "Gokōboshi" (Imperial Light Star).

○Suisei (comet/broom star) is an inauspicious star. When its color is blue, nobles die; when red, powerful nations rise; when white, military chaos occurs. It is a star that appears when disasters befall the realm.

○Taihakusei is Venus, named "morning star." It is commonly called "dawn's bright star" and rises before the sun. It is also called Keimei (enlightening brightness).

○Kokū (void/sky) is read as "sora" (sky) or "ōzora" (great sky). Also called Taikyo (great void) or Taikū (great sky), it refers to heaven. Heaven is round, empty and void, without substance or form, hence named "void."

○Mist arises from the disorder of yin and yang. When earth qi rises and heaven qi does not respond, it is called mist. When heaven qi descends and earth qi does not respond, it is called bō. When wind blows and raises dust, it is called bai (dust storm).

○Smoke is the qi of fire rising. En (smoke) is the same. Smoke also emerges from water.

○Chōkō (evening star) is Venus. It sets after the sun. This is called Chōkōsei. It is commonly called "evening's bright star."

○Wind is the breath of the great earth. It has yang nature, dispersing to become yin function. Therefore, when wind blows, earth necessarily dries. Senpū and hyōfū refer to whirlwinds.

○Dew is night qi becoming dew, the liquid of yin. The Byakkotsu states that "dew is the beginning of frost." Dew is said to "settle" (oku), not "fall" (furu).

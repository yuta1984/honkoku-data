○San (suspension bridge/scaffolding) is a shelf, a platform. Building a road by constructing wooden frameworks is called sandō or kakudō. (Supplement) This refers to creating passable roads by building bridges over steep mountain slopes where the path has been cut off and cannot be traversed.
○Hora (cave) refers to something that penetrates deeply. It is a place where there are rock caves through which paths pass. Sentō refers to caves where immortals dwell. Tō is the same. Rock caves in mountains that resemble sleeves are called shū. These are caverns.

○Misaki (cape) is the edge of a mountain. It refers to places that jut out into the sea, etc. In Echizen, there is a place called Kanegasaki.
○Mura (village) is a place where people gather and live. It's called sonraku. Originally it was written with the character son. Typically, there is no mura character in the classics and histories. Son follows yū (settlement) and follows ton (gather). Writing it separately as mura is incorrect. Now it's commonly used. Yū is the same.

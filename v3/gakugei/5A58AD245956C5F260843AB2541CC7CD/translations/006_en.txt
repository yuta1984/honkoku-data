The moon faces [the sun], and the moon's light is directed toward the earth with none toward heaven, thus creating a full moon.

○Solar eclipse occurs when the sun and moon are in heaven, with the sun above and the moon below. The new moon day is when the sun and moon meet. When the sun and moon are positioned above and below on the same path and meet, as seen from earth, the sun is covered by the moon. This is called a solar eclipse.

○Lunar eclipse occurs because the moon originally has no light and becomes bright by receiving the sun's light. When the sun and moon face each other on the same path, the earth blocks the moon, so the sun's light is obstructed by the earth, causing a lunar eclipse.

○Shin-sei (Orion's Belt) is one of the seven western mansions. Commonly, this is called the "plow star." The arrangement of stars resembles a Chinese plow.

○Bō-sei (Pleiades) is one of the western mansions. It is also called Bōtō-sei. This is what is commonly called the "Subaru star." The stars are closely arranged and clustered together.

○Kengyū is the name of a star, the "Hikoboshi" of the Orihime-Hikoboshi legend. It is also called the River Drum Star. The Tanabata festival began from when the immortal Butei of Keiyō said that on July 7th, Shokujo (Weaver Girl) marries Kengyū.

○Shokujo is the name of a star, the "Orihime" of the Orihime-Hikoboshi legend. On the seventh day of the seventh month (Tanabata), offerings of melons and fruits are placed in the garden, five-colored threads are hung on poles, and prayers are made; it is said that wishes will surely be granted within three years. This is called "begging for skills"

What is depicted here is the archery prowess of Minamoto no Tametomo, the eighth son of Minamoto no Tameyoshi, known as Chinzei Hachirō. The attackers are the brothers Itō Gorō and Itō Rokurō. Itō Gorō Kagetsuna shot an arrow at Tametomo. Tametomo, treating it as nothing, said, "I think you are an unworthy opponent, but since your words are bold, I shall give you one arrow—try to receive it." With a marune (round-headed) arrow seven sun and five bu long, fletched with mountain pheasant tail feathers near a joint of three-year bamboo, he drew his bow briefly at a distance of fifteen soku (approximately 27 meters) and shot powerfully. The arrow pierced through the chest plate of Itō Rokurō, who had advanced to the front, and the remaining force of the arrow turned inside-out the imuke sleeve of Itō Gorō, who was behind him, leaving him standing there.

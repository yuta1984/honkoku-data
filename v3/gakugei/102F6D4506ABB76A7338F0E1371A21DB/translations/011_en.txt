Illustration of Mongaku's Austere Training【In corner-cut frame】This monk's lay name was Endō Moritō, and by nature he had a fierce and strong temperament. At eighteen years old he became a monk, traveled through various provinces, and made a seven-day vow at Nachi Falls in Kumano, subjecting himself to the waterfall. This was around the twentieth day of the twelfth month, when cold snow buried the treetops and the waterfall had become like a single white thread. Even so, he entered the waterfall basin and was struck by the falls. After two or three days, his body became frozen like rock and wood, and just when his breath was about to fail, Kiṃkara and Seitaka came and rescued Mongaku. From this point his ascetic power became strong, and he wished to rebuild Jingo-ji temple at Takao, so he presented a subscription list to the Imperial Palace. However, the Heike captured Mongaku and exiled him to Izu Province. His anger ran deep, and he resolved to somehow destroy the Heike and rebuild Jingo-ji temple. At that time, Minamoto no Yoritomo had been defeated in the Heiji Rebellion and was also exiled to Izu. When Mongaku came to visit him and repeatedly urged rebellion, Yoritomo would not accept it at all. One time, when Mongaku showed him Yoshitomo's skull, Yoritomo choked with tears and lamented, "How regrettable! Since I am under imperial censure, my thoughts are in vain. If only I could now receive an imperial decree to subjugate the Heike, how could I not repay this grudge?" Mongaku replied, "If you truly intend to raise a righteous army, I will secretly request an imperial decree for you," and flew like the wind to the capital, received the imperial decree, and delivered it to Yoritomo.

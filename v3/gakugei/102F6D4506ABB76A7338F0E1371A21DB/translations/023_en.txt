【Title】Asahina Pulling the Kusazuri (lower armor plates)

Tokimune's armor is arrowhead-patterned威し (odoshi), with small plates bound with golden威し threads in verdigris color. The upper garment is brown, with no fixed style for the clothing. Some have butterflies drawn in ink. The lower part is dark blue. This is worn during night attacks. Sometimes both upper and lower garments are brown. Brown refers to an ochre color. At this time, both upper and lower garments may be tailored in vermillion.
【Crest diagram】Also, sometimes a "hut with two mokko" crest is attached. It resembles a hitatare or a daimon style.
Asahina wears a suō-hakama in dark blue, with white dancing crane crests, or alternatively mitsudomoe crests.

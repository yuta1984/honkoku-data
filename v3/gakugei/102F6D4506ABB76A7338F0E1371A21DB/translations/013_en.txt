【In corner-cut frame】The Imperial Edict at Izu
Yoritomo received an imperial edict and
persuaded Hōjō Tokimasa.
First, to launch a night attack on
the deputy governor of Izu,
Judge Izumi
Kanetaka,
Hōjō agreed, saying
if victorious, they would raise fire signals,
and if at a disadvantage, they would
send a messenger,
and headed out.
However,
the situation looked favorable,
so Hōjō also attacked
but held back in reserve.

Katō Jirō Kagenori had received Yoritomo's favor, but this time he was left out of the mission. However, feeling uneasy in his heart about what might be happening, he donned his purple-threaded belly wrap and sword and hurried to see his lord. Yoritomo stood on the veranda in light armor holding a short naginata, and upon seeing Kagenori, he said: "Tonight I sent Hōjō and Sasaki to attack Judge Izumi. They said they would set fire to the mansion if victorious, but I still see no smoke and am anxious." When Kagenori heard this, he said "The night attack should be my responsibility!" and was about to rush off when Kagenori said "Wait a moment," put on fire-threatening armor and a white-starred helmet, and saying "For night attacks, something with a longer handle than a sword would be better," gave him the short naginata he was holding. Kagenori hurried off and met with Hōjō. When Tokimasa saw him, he said "You are one who has received his lordship's favor," and Kagenori replied "That is why I was suddenly summoned and given this long sword to pierce Kanetaka's head and bring it back," showing the weapon. Hōjō, who had been struggling greatly, was able to attack the fortified residence without incident, set fire to the watchtower, and finally killed Kanetaka. Afterwards, with Doi, Tsuchiya, and Okazaki and over three hundred mounted warriors, they holed up at Ishibashiyama, then crossed to Awa and Kazusa, gained Chiba no suke as an ally, and finally destroyed the Heike clan.

【In corner-cut frame】Minamoto no Yoshitomo

This illustration shows Minamoto no Tametomo attempting to intimidate and force Yoshitomo to retreat by deliberately shooting and shaving off the star ornaments (decorative rivets) on his helmet. The remaining force of the arrow penetrated deeply into a pillar of the gate of Hōshōgon-in temple, embedding itself up to the nock.

Yoshitomo's attire:
Armor laced with black thread
Direct court robe (hitatare) of red brocade

Tametomo's attire:
Direct court robe of red brocade. The armor imitates Yoshitomo's Eight-Dragon armor, with eight lions adorning the chest plate as metal fittings. All the metal fittings are lions. The family crest on the hitatare is also a lion. The sword has a scabbard tip covered with bear skin.

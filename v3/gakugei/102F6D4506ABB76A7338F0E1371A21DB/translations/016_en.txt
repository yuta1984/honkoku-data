The Plum of Naniwa-tsu【In corner-cut frame】When Minamoto no Yoshitsune saw an aged plum tree
in Amagasaki, Settsu Province, he summoned an elderly person and inquired about it. When told that this was the plum
that was composed about as "winter retreat" during the reign of Emperor Nintoku, he lamented that
people might break off branches without reason, and summoned Benkei to write and post a prohibition sign.

　　　　Text of the Prohibition Sign
This flower is without equal elsewhere. For thieves who would break off even one branch,
following the precedent of the Ten'ei autumn leaves, if one cuts a single branch, one finger shall be cut.

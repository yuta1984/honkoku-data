Benkei took one servant and broke into Tosa's lodging, where seventy to eighty retainers were holding a council of war for a night attack
Benkei sat firmly in the seat beside Tosa and said "What are you doing? If you are in the capital, you should first report to Lord Horikawa (Yoshitsune), yet this tardiness is discourteous." As soon as he said this, he seized him, put him on his own horse, and Benkei also mounted the rear horse. Matching whip and stirrup, they galloped to Horikawa and reported this matter.

On the past 21st day at night around half past 8 o'clock, a fire broke out from the residence of Matsudaira Ōmi-no-kami in Aoyama. Due to the fierce wind at that time, all the nearby residences were affected. From the back street of the Kishu lord's residence in Akasaka, the fire spread in one sweep to Yotsuya Tenma-chō street, and from there to Ōkido, then to the area around Araki-yokochō where Matsudaira Settsu-no-kami's mansion and others were all consumed. From there to the Ichigaya Tani-chō area and the street in front of the west gate of the Owari lord's residence, then to the Owari lord's Toyama residence - all were consumed, along with the retired lord's residence being affected by the fire. From there to the Ushigome Hara-chō area and Takada area, then flying sparks reached Mejiro-dai, where about seven buildings of Daikyōtō-sama's residence long houses were burned, the mansion was quickly burned, and the nearby Zōshigaya area

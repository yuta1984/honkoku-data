　Today a person named Jirobeē from Kikuya in Hirakata came for business, so I inquired about the cholera epidemic at Ōtsu Beach and how things are going there now. I learned that over 300 people have died, and more continue to die. The origin of the cholera epidemic in Ōtsu was as follows: When a foreign ship appeared in the waters near Ōtsu Beach, bonito fishing boats rowed out to observe it. The foreigners apparently requested bonito, so they gave them some. In exchange, they received a small box. When the fishermen returned to their lodgings and opened the box, inside were two small dolls, beautifully crafted like Hina dolls. Thinking these might be deities, they placed them on the altar shelf of the Grand Shrine (Ise Shrine). However, the fisherman immediately died beneath the altar shelf, and the dolls disappeared to who knows where. From then on, the disease spread gradually, and over 300 people have died so far.

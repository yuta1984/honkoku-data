Observing the vicissitudes of our Imperial nation's fortune, since the resolution of the royal recognition and the assumption of power by the regent families, and the transfer of political authority to the military houses following the Hōhei Rebellion, our ancestors received imperial favor for over two hundred years, with descendants succeeding one another in serving that office. However, we have not infrequently lost the proper form of governance. That we have reached today's circumstances is ultimately due to our own lack of virtue, and we cannot bear the shame. Moreover, as foreign relations grow increasingly active nowadays, unless imperial authority emerges through a single channel, it will be difficult to maintain order. Therefore, we must reform old practices, return governance to the Imperial Court, broadly seek unified national consensus with firm resolve, and work together in harmony to protect our Imperial nation. If we do so, we will surely be able to stand alongside all nations overseas - there is nothing more important for our country. However, if there are any matters you have in mind, please speak freely without hesitation about taboo subjects.

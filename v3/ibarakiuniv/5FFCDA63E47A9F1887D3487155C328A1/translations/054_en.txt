In the Jōshū region, soybeans had an excellent harvest, yielding about 3 koku per tan of farmland, selling at 3 to 5 to 6 shō per ryō, brown rice at 1 to 7 shō. In Mito castle town, brown rice was 1 to 4 to 5 shō.

Four foreigners climbed Mount Ōyama Sekison, where the mountain's oshi (shrine guide) stood and tried to prevent their ascent, but they did not listen and climbed anyway. When they reached about halfway up, two of them completely disappeared, and the remaining two had their limbs torn off and were hanging from tree branches. Guard personnel accompanied them, but at some point they also disappeared—it's unclear exactly what happened.

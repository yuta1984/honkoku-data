At the beginning of this month, there was a murder case in Yamagata village, and from what I have gradually heard,
it occurred at a place somewhat withdrawn from Yamagata post station. The perpetrator had taken a daughter-in-law and
even had children, but he was dissolute in his daily life, fond of gambling,
and of poor character. Since his adoptive father was a man of some means, he frequently
begged him for money, spending it carelessly, and again asked to borrow
seven ryō. When the adoptive father remonstrated with him and refused to lend the money, two or three
days later he called out his adoptive father under the pretext of "having something to discuss."
Therefore, the adoptive father, being always cautious, brought a stick and accompanied
him. After being led quite far to a suitable spot, the son-in-law said, "Regarding the money I
spoke of the other day, I absolutely need it for unavoidable reasons, so please lend it to me."
When he made this request again, the adoptive father said, "To drag your parent all the way here and make this request again at this place is an outrageous way to behave," and in his anger
struck him with the stick. The son-in-law then seized the stick and
severely struck the adoptive
father from the collar to the shoulder area in one blow,
causing him to fall toward a cliff, where he struck him again and killed him.

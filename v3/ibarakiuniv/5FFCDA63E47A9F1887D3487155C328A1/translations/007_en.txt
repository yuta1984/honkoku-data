Letter from Edo:
Regarding the situation in this area, there is no particular change, but silk fabrics are increasingly in good demand, and other daily necessities are very expensive. Local rice (high quality) is about 9 to 10 shō per unit, lamp oil is 2 kan per shō, and currently wherever you go, they only sell in portions of 5 gō at a time.

From various reports, they are selling in small quantities, but it is rumored that when the authorities investigate, even ordinary people will have to report all their hoarded goods. In any case, we hope for prices to drop quickly. Even sake costs about 170 ryō for regular quality and about 200 ryō for high quality - truly causing hardship for common people. We earnestly pray that prices will drop soon.

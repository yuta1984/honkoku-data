When asking those who had come, they said they had made pilgrimages to Ise Grand Shrines, Konpira, 
or Nikko, Tsukuba, Kinkazan in Oshū, and so forth, 
it is said. In letters that came to Edo from various places, 
they say it truly seems like lies.

In Edo at Ōdenmacho, Tabataya Jirozaemon, at the fifth hour of the night, when he sent a shop 
employee outside, something was visible under the eaves, so when he picked it up 
and looked at it,
it was a colored painting scroll of Ise Grand Shrines that had fallen. Since there was a name of the owner from around Shiba 
area, he contacted that party. They said they had no idea when it went 
missing and there was no sign of loss at all, but it had indeed been 
lost. Tabataya also said they should return it, but 
the other party said it appeared to be completely a divine gift from the Grand Shrines, 
so there was no need to return it. Gradually it became famous and people came for pilgrimage, so when they held 
pilgrimage services for one day, 
the offerings amounted to over six ryō, but with celebrations and such, 
it cost about two hundred ryō, it is said.

Edo also continued to be troubled, and at Meguro, about thirty people broke into a daimyo 
with an income of about ten thousand koku, stole weapons and other items, and fled, it is said. 
At this time, there were those with official lanterns on horseback and such, who brought them in 
under the guise of making rounds, it is said.

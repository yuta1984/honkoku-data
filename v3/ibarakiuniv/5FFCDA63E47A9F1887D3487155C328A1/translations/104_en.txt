Lord Sakai was making his rounds and resting at a soba shop near the Shinagawa checkpoint when
about twenty or more masterless samurai burst in with drawn swords and even fired shots
before departing. When they followed their trail, the men retreated to the Satsuma domain mansion.
When Lord Sakai immediately made inquiries, they received a response that no such persons
had entered the mansion. When he reported that he had definitely confirmed otherwise,
there was an improper response, so on the 25th, they fired guns at Lord Sakai's men.
When both sides exchanged fire, a fire broke out from within the Satsuma mansion,
and they fought until the evening of the 25th. As the forces of various daimyo gradually
surrounded the Satsuma mansion, they set fires in various places and fled. Near Shinagawa,
two steamships that had been moored since last month were boarded and departed.
Those who fled by that route and the remaining forces also set fires on the escape routes near Shinagawa and fled,
but since the large ships had already departed, they missed their chance to board. About thirty to forty men
escaped to unknown destinations. Consequently, new checkpoints were established at various
entrances and exits of Edo, and security is said to be very strict at present. There were reportedly
numerous dead and wounded.
Throughout Edo, night thieves and robbers had apparently been coming from the Satsuma mansion,
but since this incident, there have been no night thieves at all.

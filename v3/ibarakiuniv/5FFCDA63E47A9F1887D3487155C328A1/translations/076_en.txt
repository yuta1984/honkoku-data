October

Although our ancestors have been entrusted with heavy responsibilities and great reliance has been placed upon us, considering the current situation throughout the realm, the purpose of this memorial is deemed most reasonable. Therefore, we shall work together with all under Heaven in unity and devotion to support foreign nations and ensure peace.

Imperial edict matter

Regarding the above matter, concerning foreign affairs, all opinions shall be exhausted, and other matters such as consultations with and proclamations to the various daimyo shall be handled by both offices at the Imperial Court. For other matters, decisions shall be made after the lords of the left come to Kyoto. Until then, territorial governance and urban policing shall continue as before, with further imperial edicts to follow.

Copy of oral instructions

On the occasion of this recent imperial will, His Majesty has thoroughly observed the situation throughout the realm and [seen that] the path of foreign intercourse has come to flourish greatly. Since having governmental authority divided into two channels would make it difficult to maintain the imperial order of our nation, this proclamation stems from His Majesty's far-sighted consideration to ensure lasting peace and stability. We are truly filled with reverence and gratitude. Particularly, [His Majesty] has taken upon himself all previous failures, acknowledged his own lack of virtue, and returned governmental authority to the Imperial Court.

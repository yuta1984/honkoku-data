[The Russians] requested to broaden various articles and conclude treaties, and regarding Russia's matter, since trade permission had already been granted, after thorough deliberations on the various requests submitted, a treaty was concluded following the American model. However, as had been rumored for some time, British ships have been arriving one after another at this time, requesting the conclusion of comprehensive treaties, and since French ships are also expected to arrive soon, after thorough deliberations on these requests as well, treaties should be concluded following the American model in a condensed form.

How are things in your area? Here lately there has been a major epidemic of a terrible disease, with countless deaths daily in the city. Some neighborhoods have as many as thirty to forty deaths each, they say. All are like sudden deaths, dying instantly within moments. This is truly a terrible situation. It is said that this disease also spread two hundred years ago according to oral tradition. We pray that it will somehow subside.

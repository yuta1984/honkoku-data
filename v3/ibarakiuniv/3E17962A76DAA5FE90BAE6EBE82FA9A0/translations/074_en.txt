1. This time a disease called "korori" (cholera) has spread, causing a great number of deaths from illness. It is said to number in the tens of thousands, with the area from Nihonbashi toward Kyōbashi having particularly large numbers of deaths. Along Yokoyama-chō street, about 150-160 funeral processions pass by daily. There is no distinction between day and night. The epidemic has spread even to the outskirts of Edo, and coffins (hayaoke) cannot keep up with demand, so bodies are being placed in sake barrels and rainwater tubs for disposal. Even the coffin makers work day and night without rest, but they simply cannot keep up with demand. I have even heard that some barrels returned from cremation grounds are being sold and reused. At the cremation grounds, there are so many corpses that they cannot burn them all in one night, so they stack up 300-400 bodies at a time, and it takes more than twenty days before they can burn them all - though I cannot confirm if this is entirely true. In addition, there appear to be many burials as well. The above is a rough account. August 18th

　Princess Atsuhime　Departing from Kyoto, poems composed during the journey
　　Though my heart longs for where I go, how precious is the distant
　　capital road at Kiso's hanging bridge
　　　　Upon seeing Kiso
　　The valley stream flows swiftly, the dream I saw upon waking
　　is the sound of Takitsu rapids by my bed
　　Facing mountains densely layered, the sound of falling water
　　is steep and harsh

　　　Fifth Month

　　　《Marginal note: From Junior Elder｜to Town Magistrates》　　　　　　Kimura Denroku's mother
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Kō
　The above person, during her husband Denroku's lifetime, never lost her wifely virtues, and after
　his death, applied even greater devotion, never disrupting the family traditions from ancestors,
　maintaining frugality, with no extravagance whatsoever. Not only was household management thoroughly
　executed, but from shop apprentices to male and female servants, she treated all without
　neglect and with sincerity, so naturally they felt gratitude, all harmonized,
　serving faithfully for many years, and many were promoted under her guidance. Furthermore, to the
　extremely poor people of the upper and lower districts, she provided white rice, miso, and money to many,
　and besides this, always kept clothing ready for women in difficult childbirth situations,
　sending food along with these during delivery, or providing foster care fees to extremely poor people whose
　newborn children lacked breast milk - such cases numbered in the dozens,
　and over the years she provided enormous amounts of money, yet in all cases
　she did not seek recognition for her deeds. Especially recently, when someone abandoned
　a child under the eaves of her residence, she wished to employ a wet nurse to raise the child,
　petitioned the appropriate office, and is raising the child - her admirable character surpasses ordinary people

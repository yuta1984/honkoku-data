Heat continues.

On the 14th and 15th days, the great flood of the Nakagawa River was caused by a landslide on Mount Nasu in Noshū province, which destroyed hot spring facilities and caused numerous deaths. Even now, three to five corpses continue to flow down the river daily. Many people from the upper and lower towns had gone to take hot spring baths, but now messengers and relatives are gradually departing.

Regarding the earthquake that shook early this month the other night, I have now heard that mountains around Toyama in Etchū province collapsed due to the earthquake, burying houses and rice fields over an area of about two ri, turning it into an open field.

21st day: Cloudy morning with southerly weather, muggy and hot. Heavy rain from 8th hour.
《Side note: 76 degrees, Day of the Ox》Clear from 7th hour, rain again from night 9th
hour, extremely hot throughout the night.

On the morning of the 14th of this month, a mountain about one ri beyond Nasu Yumoto collapsed and came to within about half a ri of the hot spring source. The people of Yumoto and the hot spring visitors suddenly fled, but the mountain on the right side of Yumoto hot spring resort split and collapsed, and earth and water rushed out together, burying all the houses on both sides. The number of deaths among local residents and hot spring visitors is unknown. There were about forty houses in Yumoto, but only six or seven houses in the upper area barely survived.

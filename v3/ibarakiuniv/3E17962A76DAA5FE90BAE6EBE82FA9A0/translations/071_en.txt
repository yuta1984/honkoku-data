For the past four or five days, there has been a great catch of bonito from Ōnuki Beach to Maehama area. At the rocky shores, each boat is catching 1,200 to 1,300 fish. Minato Suya Jirōemon's boats caught over 3,000 on the 17th and over 2,000 on the 18th, all being cut into dried bonito flakes. They are working day and night without sleep in great excitement.

In Minato, one fish sells for 95 mon, at the rocky shore about 89 mon. With this recent catch from Maehama to Ōnuki, the total amount comes to over 20,000 ryō in circulation.

Shintaku Seisuke came down from Edo yesterday, so I asked him about it. When going up, he will visit Narita shrine and go to Edo via Funahashi-dōri.

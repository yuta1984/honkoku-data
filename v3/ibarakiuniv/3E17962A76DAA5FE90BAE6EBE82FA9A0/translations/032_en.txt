Record of rumors heard at various shops while Ryōsuke was in Edo on official business

This time Lord Ii was appointed as Great Elder (Tairō), and special proclamations were issued to his domain. Until now, both high and low classes wore similar clothing, but now townspeople and farmers are permitted to wear only crepe silk, and for obi sashes, gold-threaded and velvet types are not permitted. For retainer families, cotton outer garments and thick silk undergarments are permitted, hakama and haori may be worn as before. These regulations were communicated from the domain to Edo branch stores through correspondence.

Regarding the American, this person was a Nambu domain retainer who broke out of prison about thirty years ago and crossed to America. If this is true, he would face beheading, such rumors are being discussed privately in Edo.

Regarding sugar wholesalers in Edo, they have been affiliated with medicine dealers since previous years

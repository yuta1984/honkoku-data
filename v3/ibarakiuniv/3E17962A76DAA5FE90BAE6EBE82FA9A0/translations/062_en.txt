This evening again a messenger came quickly, it is said
The castle interior and retainers have become quiet. What matter it is, we do not know.

One　　　　　　　　　　To all departments
The Former Middle Counselor has been ordered
to observe restraint, therefore all retainers without exception must exercise caution. Should there be any
tumultuous affairs, it would absolutely not be acceptable. Therefore, if young
retainers, carried away by youthful passion and acting with poor judgment, should make appeals,
it would be
unacceptable before the government authorities, and moreover
would be extremely disadvantageous for the Former Middle Counselor as well. Even if there were one person
who had been instructed in such manner, since this order has been
issued, having previously
not understood the government's intentions, out of loyalty between lord and retainer and from excessive concern,
there might be some who, thinking deeply and becoming agitated, might go up to Edo.
With deep consideration for this, Imai Kinemon has been
directly instructed and sent down. Until further
developments and official word are communicated according to circumstances, not only the young retainers
but also all subordinates down to the lowest ranks must take care not to act with poor judgment, and we should coordinate well
to maintain peace.

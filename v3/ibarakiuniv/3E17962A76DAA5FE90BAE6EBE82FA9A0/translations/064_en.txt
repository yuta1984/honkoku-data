　　Copy of Lord Echizen Chujo's direct letter
　Regarding the matter that has been ordered this time, there will certainly be those among the group who are dissatisfied,
　however, as for myself, having always devoted my sincere efforts, this is ultimately
　out of respect as a member of the house, and solely
　for the sake of the authorities. In matters I consider pressing, I have not the slightest
　intention of being concerned about personal fortune or misfortune. If this time the succession matter
　is granted to Hyuga-no-kami without fail, then above all, the peaceful governance of the domain
　goes without saying,
　I swear to the gods and will earnestly pray for the eternal prosperity of the authorities

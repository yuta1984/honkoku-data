Last night at Nokoya as well, two people wearing hoods came at half past the 6th hour saying they wanted to meet the master. When told he was away, they said they came to borrow money and since he was away, they would meet the manager. They randomly wrapped available goods from the shop in furoshiki cloths or put them in their pockets and took them away. Throughout the upper and lower towns, such incidents are occurring everywhere, causing great hardship in the city.

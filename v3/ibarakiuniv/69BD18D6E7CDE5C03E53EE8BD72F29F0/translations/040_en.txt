《Marginal note: 58 degrees》
On the 8th of this month, in Kashima Village near Omiya Village, a married couple had gone out to work in the fields. Around the hour of the Horse (10 AM), the husband said he would return home for lunch, but the wife said it was still early for lunch. However, he insisted on returning, so the couple went home together. The husband then shut the door, drew his sword, and attacked his wife. When she tried to block with both hands, all her fingers were cut off, so she fled. He struck her about three more times from behind, then went outside to the main house. Finding no one home as they had gone to work in the fields, he committed seppuku and died. The wife died after about two days. This appears to be a case of madness.

Kitamura of Sekijuku riverside is said to be quite wealthy. About twenty men broke into his house at night, tied up the entire household, and stole a large amount of money and valuables.

Indeed, this is truly an unprecedented and mysterious thing. This seems to be because cotton and thread are still being traded at Yokohama. Thread, which normally costs around 800-900 mon per ten bundles, now costs around 1 sen 800-900 to 2 kan mon per ten bundles.

This year, summer high-grade fabric costs around 44-45 monme per tan to purchase - an unusually high price. Satsuma striped fabric for single garments normally costs around 30 monme to 37-38 monme per tan, but last year it rose to 57-58 monme, which was already considered very expensive. This year, when purchasing in Edo, there is nothing available below 115-116 monme per tan. In the countryside, all locally-made goods are expensive and money circulation seems good, but for samurai families and townspeople making their living through purchases, the high prices of all goods cause extreme hardship.

In the Kamigata region, since His Majesty's visit to Kyoto and the subsequent sankin attendance of various daimyo, money circulation is extremely good, and they are completely unconcerned about high prices of goods.

As cotton thread has become increasingly expensive, trading restrictions have been imposed in other places, but there are still those selling in the downtown areas.

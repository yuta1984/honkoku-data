[Tadenuma] stayed in Oyama at the beginning of this month and went to Yūki, where more than 200 rōnin had arrived and petitioned the domain lord to lend them 2,000 ryō in gold and provisions. Among those serving as town officials in the city, they piled wheat straw at five locations and laid out mats, threatening that if the money could not be provided, they would burn down the city. The city was no place for commerce - houses had their doors shut and warehouses had their openings sealed with clay. So Tadenuma returned to Oyama again and stayed there for four or five days. The aforementioned forces wore light armor and jinbaori (battle surcoats), with twenty to thirty mounted men and twenty to thirty spears. From what I gradually heard, in Yūki they produced 500 ryō in gold from the city, and that settled the matter, though two or three Yūki retainers were also taken as hostages by the opposing side. From there they returned to Oyama and went to Mibu, where the bridge was destroyed and they attacked with large and small cannons, the sound of which could be heard all the way to Oyama. The sound of gunfire lasted for about half a day. Therefore they did not go to Mibu but went to Jōshū instead. It was a two-pronged operation. In Oyama they pitched curtains and what appeared to be generals took up residence. Separately, one force of about 300 men went to Shimodate, and negotiations are currently underway there. Large cannons and such were lined up at the main gates and other locations

From within Koishikawa Mansion　From Head Carpenter Hashimoto Zenbei:
On the night of the 25th from the hour of the Monkey and a half [around 3:30 AM], there was wind and rain that gradually became severe. From the hour of the Cock [around 6 PM] to around half past the hour of the Horse [around 1:30 AM], it became an especially great storm, with about three great thunderclaps and two earthquakes. The roof tiles of the palace quarters flew off, causing great damage in various places. All the outer enclosures collapsed, the front long houses of the Guardian Hall collapsed, the Copper Gate and the entrance corner gate in front of Denzu-in Temple collapsed, and within the mansion grounds, one hundred large and small trees [were damaged/fell].

26th day dispatch

Last night from the 5th and half hour, with southeast winds, rain began to fall, and around the 9th and half hour, there was such fierce wind with heavy rain that there was no respite from the violent storm. Consequently, high waves in the rivers swept away houses in the Shiba-Takanawa area, and the Honjo-Fukagawa area also became completely flooded. Some people managed to raise their floor levels and barely survived, but among them, quite a few who could not endure lost their lives. On Tsukuda Island, not a single house remained - all were washed away, and there were numerous deaths as well. The casualty count has not yet been reported. In Fukagawa, temporary houses were blown down by the wind, and this also resulted in many injured and dead. Five government ship warehouses in Honjo were blown down, as was the Tsukiji gate ruins. Eitai Bridge collapsed from its middle section. In addition to these water and wind disasters occurring in various places, there were also fires, with considerable areas burned in Asakusa and Shiba. This was truly an extraordinary storm.

The above is a copy of a letter submitted by Kiuchi Hyōshichi, who had come up from the Edo stone quarry.

An indescribable spring evening　　　　Evening bell
　　The gold the abbot brings out, so warm　　Ruined temple
　　　Taking up the hoe, he's back to being Jinpei　　Earth carrier
　　The foreman makes more money from earth than rice　　Plasterer
　　　With four hundred courtesans brought to their peak　　Craftsman
　　Suddenly love and heartlessness exchange places　　Yoshiwara
　　　Even temporary lodgings are well-maintained　　Horse dealer
　　Heave-ho! The five hundred days of prayer fulfilled　　Temporary residence
　　　Slowly, slowly the variety halls begin again　　Storytelling
　　Even go players are counted among the geishas　　Go player
　　　In a world where one cannot live just by playing　　Entertainer
　　Apart from food, the lonely two-day moon　　Tori district
　　　Suddenly the accumulated water was drained　　Underground storage
　　Even small houses benefit from the rice harvest requiring walking sticks　　In town
　　　Sake that doesn't cost forty mon isn't drinkable　　Recently
　　Casually vomiting up the gold coins　　Fat cats
　　　Sundry goods shops will soon prosper too　　Next year
　　Everything returns to the old ways, Edo's flowers　　World reform
　　　Facing the New Year's sun beyond Mount Fuji, the dragon year　　Final brush
　　　　Winter of Kinoto-U (1855)　　　　　　Playfully composed by Rice Elder

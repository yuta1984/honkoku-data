So Kakujiro withdrew to his original position, and I went to fix my hair at the service entrance. After that, I wanted to meet with Teisei and Hanko again to reach a settlement, but Teisei was not present, and since Hanko was heavily drunk, his household said he should come to my residence tomorrow. Understanding that Teisei had returned home, I left Hanko's residence and went to Teisei's house, intending to settle the earlier matter. However, Teisei's attendant told me he had not yet returned home. As I was about to return home myself, my retainer Kakujiro said, "Perhaps Teisei is still at Hanko's residence; let me go inquire," and Kakujiro hurried off alone. I followed after him, but while I was relieving myself along the way, I heard some kind of noise, so I called out "What are you doing?" and rushed over. Kakujiro told me, "It was so regrettable that I struck him down," which shocked me, and when I asked "Is he dead?" he further said "I finished him off." So I told him, "You acted far too hastily and rashly. There's nothing to be done about it now - prepare yourself." Kakujiro replied, "It was so regrettable that I struck him down myself, so I am prepared." I said, "It cannot be helped. I will inform Hanko of this matter and also report it to the street guard, and we shall await the authorities' decision." While I was informing them of this matter from in front of Hanko's gate, I lost sight of the aforementioned Kakujiro.

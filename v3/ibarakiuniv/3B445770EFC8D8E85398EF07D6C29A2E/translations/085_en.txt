This noble consideration being the case, it is most gracious.
So that this benevolent will may penetrate deeply throughout, consult together with your fellow officials and handle this matter appropriately.

However, detailed matters shall be communicated within the domain.

The Scribe
　　　　　　　　　　　　To all retainers of the Esui domain
Regarding military system reform, since all defensive preparations now consist of firearms and artillery, even minor construction workers must without exception be instructed in firearm formation drills and training. Furthermore, if the sons of senior retainers and others do not practice firearm formation drills and training from a young age, they will be unable to give proper commands when they assume leadership positions. Therefore, they too must undergo this training. Even the sons of senior retainers and magistrates, if they become arrogant from a young age and do not train together with others, when they assume leadership positions their commands will be inadequate, they will receive criticism from below, and moreover victory will be unlikely. Should this happen, we would fail in our duty as defenders of the domain. Therefore, everyone should understand that they must practice the Shinpatsu-ryu formation and drilling training.

Although I considered pursuing and searching for him, I thought it would be improper if I were to rush past the street guard post and be called out to. So I immediately reported to the street guard that my retainer had struck down Teisei, and furthermore had the sword examined for future reference, then immediately withdrew and reported the matter to the proper authorities. There is nothing else to report beyond this.

Fukuda Hanko's Statement
On the evening of the 17th, I had arranged to invite Ubukata Keiichiro, a retainer of Inaba Shotaro-sama who resides in Muramatsu-cho, to my residence. At that time, Kaneko Kenshiro, a retainer of Mito-sama, came to pay his New Year's respects, so thinking this fortunate, I detained him as well. His wakato (young attendant) was brought up to the entrance hall to wait. Before long, Keiichiro arrived, so I served sake to everyone. As the evening progressed and they became intoxicated, the two men began playing ken (a drinking game) and making merry, but this gradually turned into an argument and they began grappling with each other. I tried to calm both parties, but they would not listen. Since Kenshiro has been particularly close to me for many years, like a younger brother, I first restrained him and pushed him back, but accidentally touched his hair and disheveled it. Meanwhile, all the household members gathered to restrain and calm them down. Keiichiro was taken to another room, and I had my household staff fix Kenshiro's hair. He departed around the fifth hour of the night (around 8 PM) with his wakato.

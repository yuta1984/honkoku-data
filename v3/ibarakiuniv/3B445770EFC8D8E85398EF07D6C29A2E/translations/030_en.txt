The mother of Watabiki Sobei from Higashino Village, who turned ninety-two this year, wove two bolts of white cotton cloth by herself and presented them to His Lordship (the Shogun). On the 24th day of the third month, she received written works and poems in return.

Imperial handwriting:
The flower seal □ on the separate paper belongs to the Renchu (lady behind the screen), Akiko is Princess Matsu, and Takako is Princess Yashiro. The daughters usually do not write on large pieces like tanzaku poem cards, so this is particularly well done. Everything was written as formal calligraphy.

Former Middle Counselor:
"The cloth woven by a woman approaching one hundred years - may I too be blessed with such long life"

Middle Counselor:
"The elderly cannot keep warm without silk cloth - Nanzan □□"

Former Lady behind the Screen:
"Showing me the cloth that a woman of over ninety years wove herself, you bid me compose a poem about this"

Some time later, someone claiming to be Kenshiro's retainer came to the gate and inquired, "I went to Keiichiro's place to ask about him, but was told he had not yet returned home. Is he still here?" The person who received him handled the matter by answering that he had already left. After watching for a while, around half past the fifth hour (around 8:30 PM), Keiichiro was ready to return home accompanied by his son who had come to escort him since the drinking party. I had my servant Matahei carry a lantern to lead the way, while Keiichiro's son and another servant named Toyozo accompanied Keiichiro from behind to see him off. When Keiichiro stepped outside the gate, someone attacked him with a sword, causing Keiichiro to fall on the spot. The servant who was leading was startled and fled as far as the Ryogoku area. Keiichiro's son and Toyozo, who were following behind, also panicked and rushed back inside the gate, so they could not identify the attacker. When Keiichiro's son cried out that his father had been cut down, the entire household was in shock and commotion. At that moment, Kenshiro came and requested to meet with me at the gate, but the person who received him declined the meeting, saying that tonight was too chaotic. Meanwhile, Keiichiro was taken away by his relatives who had come for him. Beyond this, I know nothing whatsoever about what happened outside the gate. There is nothing else to report. The above.

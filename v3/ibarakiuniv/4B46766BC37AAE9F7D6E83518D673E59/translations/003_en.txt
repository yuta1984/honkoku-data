In this year of the Snake (Ansei 4, 1857), from spring onward, black clouds have been appearing every morning from the east to the north. Even on the clearest days, they appear in the early morning. During the Tenpō famine and poor harvests, they consistently appeared as well. This should be well remembered, as it may be a sign of abnormal weather. In years with good weather, after evening thunderstorms, the sky quickly clears, but during periods of abnormal weather, after thunderstorms, northeastern winds prevent the rain from clearing easily, bringing cold air. Throughout summer, the abnormal weather continued, creating a tumultuous situation. However, from early autumn, contrary to expectations, the weather improved and both rice and field crops began to recover. As a result, people's spirits also became calm.

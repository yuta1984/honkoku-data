　Presented to His Highness the Taikun of Japan
　　　As a great friend
　We believe that the treaty concluded between the United States and Japan should be revised to make trade in the vast array of products between Your Highness's great nation and the United States even greater and easier to conduct. For this purpose, I have selected the honorable and dignified Townsend Harris of this country as the bearer of this letter to hold conferences with your country's Foreign Minister or other officials appointed by Your Highness regarding this matter. This person has already gained the trust of Your Highness's Foreign Minister as Consul General of the United States. I have no doubt that the Minister or other officials will agree to the provisions of a treaty that will deepen and perpetuate the friendship between the United States and Japan, while also increasing commercial relations for the benefit of both nations.
　I trust that Your Highness will receive the honorable and dignified Harris with deep kindness and give full credence to the words he will present to Your Highness on my behalf

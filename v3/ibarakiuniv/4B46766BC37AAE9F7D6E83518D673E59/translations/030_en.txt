Castle Document from the 28th day of the 4th month, Ansei 4, Year of the Snake

Senior Fourth Rank Upper Grade　　　　　Matsudaira Sanuki-no-kami

Due to your distinguished lineage, you were appointed to Senior Fourth Rank Lower Grade through special consideration. Although there has been little interval since then and promoting you further would normally be difficult to deliberate upon, this time you have been ordered to undertake the coastal battery duties at Osaka, and all defensive matters have been entrusted to you. Therefore, through even more special consideration this time, understand that you are being promoted in court rank, and you must make exceptional efforts in guard duties.

Article 1: For defense against foreign ships, coastal batteries are to be constructed at both river mouths of the Ajigawa and Kizugawa in Osaka, with cannons installed and ships also prepared as ordered. Two coastal battery positions at the Kizugawa mouth are entrusted to you. For these coastal batteries, ships, and installed cannons, Western-style methods are ordered, so with this understanding, you should order training in artillery firing methods. Matsudaira Dewa-no-kami has been ordered to guard Osaka, and two coastal battery positions at Ajigawa are entrusted to him, so you should coordinate with him. You should also consult with Tsuchiya Uneme-no-shō.

The above was announced by Kuze Yamato-no-kami with the Senior Councilors in attendance at the Black Shoin Antechamber.

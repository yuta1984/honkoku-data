18th Day　Cloudy from morning, south wind from Mount Fuji blowing from the fourth hour
　Today at half past the ninth hour of noon, a fire broke out from a tenant in the seven-house tenement in Kitayoko-cho at the residence compound of Gunji Taroji in Mukai-machi. Due to the strong south wind from Mount Fuji at that time, the south side of Kitayoko-cho burned in an instant. From the burned Fukuo Nabenosuke residence at the entrance of Momiji-koji, the fire spread to the adjacent Nakata Kinbei house, then the fire pushed out to Kata-machi, and was stopped near the grain storage warehouse in Baguchirou-machi. From there the fire spread to the moat embankment at Shibano, then jumped to Goto Yabei's tenement behind Shimogane-machi, blowing out into Shimogane-machi. On both sides of Shimogane-machi, it stopped at Kameya Zenbei's house on the south side and at the big slope on the north side. In some places it pushed to both sides up to the entrance of Hachiman-machi, with spot fires occurring throughout Hachiman-machi, with the entire south side of Hachiman-machi stopping at the stone platform area. Also due to flying sparks, the roof tiles of Betto Tadokoro burned. Due to the strong wind, fires jumped to various places and could not be prevented by any means. Even those who tried to carry out their belongings had everything burned due to the extremely fierce wind. Strong wind all day, rain falling after nightfall, strong south wind all night.

should be the case, but recently it has been heard that everyone is working diligently and all retainers are united, which is most gratifying. Going forward, please keep the nation's welfare foremost in mind, encourage people through both literary and military arts, and ensure that no failures occur during unexpected situations. Since the true intentions of the barbarians are also not to be taken lightly, please apply your minds with particular care. I communicate this accordingly.

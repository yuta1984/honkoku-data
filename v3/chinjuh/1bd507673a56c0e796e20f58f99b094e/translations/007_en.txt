One time, a deer
stole and ate
one sweet potato
that had been planted
in Kaidō-maru's field.
Because it was so
delicious, it ended up eating
all of them, so Kintarō
became very angry
and called the deer over.

He scolds it greatly and
torments it in various ways with his feet.

Kintarō:
♪"You stole and ate
what I was saving
for my enjoyment, and then
act innocent—
what a hateful creature! If you
steal again, I'll beat you
to death!"

Deer:
♪"Yes, yes, please forgive
me. They were so
delicious that I ended up eating
them all. Oh my,

being trampled like this
over some sweet
potatoes
is really miserable,"
it says, troubled.

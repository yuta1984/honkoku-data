Chapter 1: Gallant Style
Near Ryogoku Moto-Yanagibashi, there lived one who called himself Kawaian, with a tasteful folding gate made of bush clover branches. A customer entering here is an elegant man called Roshigure. His hair is moderately shaved in the middle with a protruding topknot, his forehead broadly shaved back, wearing a raw silk haori on top. His kimono is tea-colored, underneath small-patterned with hailstone design. A half-sleeved autumn maple juban. All with collar of unpatterned shark skin. He wears a black satin obi and a small-patterned haori.

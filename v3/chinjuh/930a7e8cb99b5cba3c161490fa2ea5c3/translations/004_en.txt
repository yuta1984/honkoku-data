Now, by recounting the biography of these two women - the circumstances of courtesans, the methods of love affairs, and the life stories of libertines - perhaps Gachoan's scheme also became an omen of storms amid flowers.

Lamenting this, I have written down O-Toyo's life story in a libertine style, and named it "Yobuko-dori" (The Calling Bird).

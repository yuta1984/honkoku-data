The person from the Little People's Island found Japan fascinating and was walking around looking at the surroundings when a strong wind blew, lifted him up over the country, and blew him down into a well in the back. Asahina panicked, thinking it wouldn't be amusing to lose such an important commodity, and wanted to help, but having no immediate means at hand, Long-Armed Islander said "This is the moment to show my skill," and without any fuss, bared his shoulder, extended his hand into the well, and easily pulled him out without difficulty. At this time, there was no one among them all who wasn't impressed by Long-Armed Islander.

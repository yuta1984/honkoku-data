Asahina recovered his losses through the fine calligraphy of Kojin-shima and the large characters of the Giant Country people. With this success, he made Takashima his chief clerk, employed the people with holes as ronin-turned-assistants, used Kojin-shima as an errand boy since they required no miscellaneous expenses, but found the Giant Country people troublesome—starting with their clothing and the difficulty of finding places for them to stay. Since they proved unprofitable, he gave them travel money and sent them back to their country. In the end, his profit was having two mistresses: a woman from Nyogo Island and a black woman, welcoming what seemed like an interesting spring.

Asahina had his two mistresses pluck the whiskers from both sides of his face, presenting a leisurely and relaxed appearance.

【Asahina's dialogue】
"If I pluck my whiskers, no one will think I'm Asahina!"

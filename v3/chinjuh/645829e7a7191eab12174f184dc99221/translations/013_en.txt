Tenaga-shima was the type who wouldn't get up for free even after falling, so as he was leaving Asahina's house, he stole a temple bell from a nearby temple. The temple held various discussions, and following the old saying that "tall people are bell thieves," they concluded that this must surely be the work of Seitaka-shima, the freeloader who had recently come to stay at Lord Asahina's place. When the temple's young monks came to make this complaint, Asahina was greatly troubled.

Asahina said:
"This Seitaka-shima is not such a bad person. That must surely be Tenaga-shima's doing. Since there's nothing to be done about it, I'll compensate for the bell. Also, I'll make Seitaka-shima look like a normal person so he won't receive such suspicions in the future."
And he put a bamboo basket over Seitaka-shima's head to make him shorter.

From Tanba Province,
a captured mountain storm,
hey there, monk!

"When you see this basket, if you try to run away, I'll hit your rear with a pot!"

"Yes, yes, Master's birthday..."

"They say Takao's ransom was piled as high as one is tall, but if they piled it as high as I am, it would cause a great commotion!"

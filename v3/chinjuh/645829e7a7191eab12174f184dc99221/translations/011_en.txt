Tenaga-shima was inherently a very greedy creature. He spotted a merchant in the neighborhood who wasn't wealthy, and one night he secretly left his body and left hand sleeping at home, dressed only his right hand in black clothing, and entered through the sliding door of that house as a thief. However, the wife of this house was beautiful and disheveled in sleep, lying defenseless without awareness of her surroundings. Though he was tempted to take advantage of her vulnerable sleeping state, since he had only his hand there, he could do nothing about it. At that moment, the master of the house discovered him and cried out "Oh, a monster!" So despite entering what should have been a treasure trove, he returned home empty-handed.

【Master's dialogue】
Well, well,
　　what a long arm!
It earned the name
　　of Long-armed one indeed!

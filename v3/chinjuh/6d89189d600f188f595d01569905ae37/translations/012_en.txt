Wild warriors and pirates also rushed to gather, one after another, and their forces consisted of three hundred bandits who barricaded themselves. Already in mid-August, Kajiwara Heiji Kagetaka received command of the vanguard and led one hundred mounted retainers to attack Mount Hakone, besieging the bandits.

The bandits were thoroughly defeated and fled desperately for their lives.
"Oh, how painful, how painful!"
"We are crushed body and soul by Kajiwara's retainers!"

"What a pathetic sight they make in fleeing!"

The bandit leader, Doji, upon hearing that a punitive force was coming from Kamakura, gave orders to his subordinates to defend their position. They appeared here and emerged there, hurling down large stones.

Heiji Kagetaka said, "What cruel deeds these men do! It's as if they were staged like Obata no suke in a theater play!"

(Dialogue of Kajiwara's retainers)
"This is impossible to handle, spare us!"
"These fellows all seem quite formidable - flee, flee!"

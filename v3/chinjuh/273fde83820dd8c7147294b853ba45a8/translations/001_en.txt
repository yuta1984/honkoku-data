Ikkyu Stories

【This material has been registered as a reference for other materials, and the transcribed text consists of "something I happened to have" and "parts hastily created as needed," so the content is quite haphazard. I don't have much intention of correcting it either. If there are people who want to read this kind of material properly, I would ask that they first understand our guidelines and how to use "Minna de Honkoku" (Transcribe with Everyone). Since it contains mixed Chinese characters, the difficulty level is somewhat high, and troublesome Chinese poems and such may appear along the way】

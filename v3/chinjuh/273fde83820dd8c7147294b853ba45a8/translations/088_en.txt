"You speak such things carelessly with your mouth. No matter what you say with your mouth, your heart is not truly so. Do you, venerable monk, truly know the loving heart of real parent and child?" Ikkyu answered, "I know it quite well." The old monk said, "What do you all think? Zen is transmission from mind to mind. How could one know a child's heart? Unless one becomes parent and child, it is difficult to know," and he laughed mockingly. So everyone said, "You are all quite right. The hearts of parent and child are difficult for ordinary people to understand. Unless one becomes parent and child, how could one know? Has Master Ikkyu become parent and child to observe this?" They all laughed. Ikkyu, without the slightest disturbance, said, "Now, now, you all speak foolish things. Even without becoming parent and child, we know well the state of a child's heart." When he said this, everyone replied, "That is impossible." "Listen, people! Then unless you all become this Ikkyu, you cannot understand the heart that knows the hearts of parent and child," he laughed. At this, everyone fled in panic.

【The Matter of Ikkyu Climbing Mount Koya and Composing a Poem About the Mountain Scene】
When Master Ikkyu climbed Mount Koya and gazed at the mountains in all four directions, thinking the scenery was more interesting than he had heard, the Koya hijiri (mountain ascetics) came out and, seeing Ikkyu, asked "What manner of person are you?" He replied, "Well, I am merely a nameless religious seeker, but as this is my first time seeing this mountain, the scenery is so interesting that I am contemplating composing a humble poem or song."

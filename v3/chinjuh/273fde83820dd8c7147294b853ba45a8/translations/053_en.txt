So it came to pass, and one servant said, "Tomorrow is New Year's Day. What shall we offer? There is not even one gō of rice in the rice container, and we don't have a single copper coin." When he lamented thus, Ikkyu heard him and said, "That is nothing to lament about. Come, let us go out." So saying, he brandished a staff and went out to the Yamaga Highway. Just then, a pottery seller happened to pass by, so he chased after him saying "I won't let you escape!" The man was startled and threw down his load of pottery dishes and fled. "How fortunate!" said Ikkyu, and had the servant he brought carry them. Thus he obtained these without payment and welcomed the New Year. But unexpectedly, a daimyo passed away, and they invited Ikkyu to conduct the funeral service. He said, "No, I will not go." When they asked "Why will you not come?" he replied, "If you give me money, I'll go." "That's easy enough. How much do you need?"

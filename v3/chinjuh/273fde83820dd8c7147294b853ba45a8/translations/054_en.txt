they asked, he said "About eight mon for one rope." When they offered this modest amount, he received the money and went to the place where he had committed the robbery earlier. He tied the money to the pottery basket and put up a sign that read: "Payment for pottery from the night of the last day of last month: 1 kan and 8 mon. Each piece at 1 mon as recorded in the account book." Beside it, he wrote a verse:

"Stealing out of poverty is not breaking the precept against theft. Why is this so? There is proof that love poems do not violate the precept against adultery. The venerable saint Jichin Osho wrote this poem:
'My love is like the autumn rain that cannot dye the pine—the wind stirs in the field of arrowroot.'
Just because of this, one would not think he broke the precept against adultery. Since my theft was also due to poverty, it cannot be said that I broke the precept against stealing."

So it was written. Then he went to perform the funeral service and said:
"People give six mon as rokudō-sen (six realms money). You gave 1 kan and 8 mon as indō-sen (funeral service money). That's quite sincere. So you have given 1 kan and 2 mon more than others. There are paths in all ten directions. Go straight in whichever direction you wish. Your attainment of Buddhahood is certain without doubt. Why is this so? Whether you have money or not, even hell's judgment depends on money." When he said this, everyone was amazed, and there was no one who did not admire him as "What a comical person!"

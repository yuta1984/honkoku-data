The hijiri (mountain ascetics) had no idea this was Ikkyu, and said mockingly, "What a shabby monk! Truly like a blind man peering over a fence. Perhaps even lies serve to console the heart? That person is wearing a paper kimono, looking wretched and miserably cold. The thinness of his collar is even thinner than the razor blades that are a specialty of this mountain, and his thin neck looks quite precarious." They laughed among themselves. Although Ikkyu felt embarrassed, he maintained a composed expression and said, "I have composed a poem, so might I have some ink stone and paper?" They responded, "What? You've composed a poem already? How remarkably fast!" Again laughing among themselves, they said, "Well then, we'll lend you ink stone and paper." Ikkyu took up the brush and recalled how the lay Buddhist Dongpo had composed poetry in the shape of a mountain at Jingshan Temple. The way to read that mountain-shaped poem is as follows:

The mountain is high, approaching the Tushita Inner Court
The mountain is tranquil, manifesting the Flower Treasury World
The mountain welcomes the connected peaks, announcing the Buddha-mind  
The mountain is level, transforming the secluded source into Buddha-land
The mountain in spring opens flowers, advancing the Buddha-mind
The mountain in summer has cool breezes that awaken from earthly desires
The mountain in autumn has falling leaves - emptiness upon emptiness
The mountain in winter has pure snow - tranquility upon tranquility

Having composed this so instantly with flowing brush strokes, the hijiri of the entire mountain clapped their hands, saying "What magnificent calligraphy! What an unfamiliar poetic form!" Their mouths hung agape in amazement.

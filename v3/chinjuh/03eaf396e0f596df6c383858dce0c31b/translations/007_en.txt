The person from Women's Island, though used in the pond, has round eyes but is a stubborn and impudent fellow - a black woman. While thinking there must be some way to deal with this situation...

【Kaga Library: "Recently"】
When Dutch-imported washing powder, advertised everywhere, is applied, miraculously - like the moon emerging in a dark night, like Urashima opening his treasure box - whether it be a dyer's hakama or a flour merchant's mouse, everything turns white instantly.

〽It's like being reborn 【Kaga Library: "Such was"】

【Black woman's dialogue】
Don't praise me so much - it might just be a dream.

〽Oh my, oh my - as beautiful as fine kudzu, so pretty, so pretty.

Since Long-Armed Island was fond of alcohol, one night when Asaina was away, he took advantage of the sake barrel sleeping soundly, reached from the inner parlor to the sake room, and licked the spout. The barrel suddenly woke up and, in anger and disgust, covered the spout. Just then, needing to urinate, he pretended it was sake and filled a tea bowl with urine. Long-Armed Island, unaware, thought the urine was sake and drank it down with satisfaction.

【Sake barrel (Senkyo Country)'s dialogue】
〽Lately I've had a bit of a fever, so it's the color of aged sake - which is to say, urine.

Someone said:
The sound of sake pouring is "glug glug"
The sound of urine is "splash splash"
Considering this, in Abukuma's song,
"Escaping from the viper's mouth" -
Could this be what it refers to?

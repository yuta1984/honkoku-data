Even if one accumulates a thousand ryō of gold, it cannot compare to one day of learning.
Brothers are not always together. Make compassion your brother.
Material wealth does not last forever. Make talent and wisdom your wealth.
The four elements (the body) decay daily, and the mind grows darker each night.
If one does not diligently study in youth, even if one regrets and laments in old age,
there will still be no benefit. Therefore, do not neglect reading books.
Do not be lazy in your studies. Remove sleep and recite through the night.
Endure hunger and practice learning all day long. Even if you meet a teacher, if you do not study,

it is like vainly facing people in the marketplace. Even if you learn and read, if you do not review,
it is just like counting your neighbor's treasure. The gentleman loves the wise,
while the petty person loves the fortunate. Even when entering a wealthy household,
a person without wealth is still like a flower under frost.
Even when emerging from the gate of poverty, a person with wisdom
is just like a lotus in the mud. Parents are like heaven and earth,
and teacher-lords are like the sun and moon. Relatives are like reeds,
and husband and wife are still like roof tiles. Be filial to your parents morning and evening.

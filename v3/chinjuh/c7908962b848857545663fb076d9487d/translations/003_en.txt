Jitsugokyo (Teachings of Truth)

A mountain is not noble because it is high. It is noble because it has trees.
A person is not noble because they are fat. They are noble because they have wisdom.
Wealth is the treasure of one lifetime. When the body perishes, it perishes together with it.
Wisdom is the treasure of ten thousand generations. When life ends, it follows along.
A jewel has no light if it is not polished. Without light, it is the same as stone or tile.
A person has no wisdom if they do not study. Without wisdom, they are a foolish person.
The wealth inside a storehouse may decay. The talent within the body does not decay.

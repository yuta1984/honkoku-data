The cat and tanuki
had suffered another
terrible ordeal, and somehow
wanting to defeat
the old man, they also
enlisted that
monkey's help.
"In any case, if it's just the rabbit
we're not scared,
but the dog has such
great courage that we should aim for when he's tired
and attack the old man's
house during his absence," they
decided in their consultation. The cat, tanuki, and
monkey - these three saw the dog
going for a long walk one day and thought "today's
the day!" So they went to the old man's house and
found that the old man was also away,
with only the rabbit
house-sitting.
The three immediately sat down boldly in cross-legged positions.

entertaining them in various ways, saying "Wait for the old man's return." In truth,
he planned to wait for the dog's return and defeat them by joining forces, offering sake to

　　　encourage them to drink
　　　
　This is his plan to
　get these three drunk

Thus everyone
rejoicing together
was about to
beat the monkey as well,
when from Momotaro,
a companion
in their story,
a pheasant was
sent as
a messenger
saying
"Given the thousand
years of
meritorious service on Demon
Island,"
a pardon was granted,
and so his life in danger
was saved.
　　The end, the end.

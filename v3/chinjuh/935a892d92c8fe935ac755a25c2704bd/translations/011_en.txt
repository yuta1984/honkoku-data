The sparrow said
"Wait a
moment!"
Though they tried to stop it,
it wouldn't listen.
While making a commotion
"There! Here!"
Yesterday's
wicker basket that had been
so heavy -
that container was
suspicious. So they lowered the basket
from the cherry
branch and opened the lid.
What should they find but
the crab from before, its
wounds healed, along with
many small crabs
crawling out from inside the basket.
Taking advantage of the opportunity, they pinched wildly,
especially targeting the monkey
who was their enemy, snapping at
nose, ears, and head
indiscriminately, pinching
frantically. The monkey cried "Kyah!

Kyah!" in panic,
running around in circles, his
bottom swollen
bright red, suffering
greatly.
In this pleasant
moment of opportunity,
the dog stood up
and returned, thinking
first to
rescue his
master.

He carried him on his back
to the boat,
helped him aboard,
and tried to
row out to safety.

《Title: Great Shun》

In formation they plow in spring, elephants busily cut grass, birds
Succeeding Yao, he ascends to the precious throne, filial piety moves the heart of Heaven

Great Shun was an extremely filial person. His father's name was Gusou. He was very stubborn, and his mother was a stepmother who was spiteful. His younger brother Xiang was very arrogant and dissolute. Even so, Great Shun devoted himself entirely to filial piety. Once, when he was farming at a place called Mount Li, moved by his filial devotion, a great elephant came and plowed the fields, and birds flew down to cut the grass in the fields, helping with the farm work. Now, the ruler of the realm at that time was called King Yao. His elder princess daughter was called Ehuang, and his younger daughter was called Nüying. King Yao heard of Shun's filial conduct and summoned him, gave him his daughters as empresses, and finally abdicated the realm to him. This all arose entirely from the depth of his filial heart.

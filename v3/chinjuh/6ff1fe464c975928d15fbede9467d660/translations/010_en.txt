Now, Asahina of Kobayashi came to the seashore intending to cross between the islands. When he tried to board a large ship, the boatmen refused to let him aboard and quarreled with him. "If that's the case, this is troublesome," he said.

He lightly swung around the mast, and angrily declared, "If the boatmen won't let me aboard, I'll beat you to death with this!" The boatmen were greatly terrified, apologized profusely, and let him board the ship.

"If you don't quickly set sail, I'll smash everything to pieces! How about that? You'll all become wood splinters!"

【Boatmen's dialogue】
"Ah, we were mistaken! We will let you aboard, sir. Please forgive us first. Forgive us, forgive us!"

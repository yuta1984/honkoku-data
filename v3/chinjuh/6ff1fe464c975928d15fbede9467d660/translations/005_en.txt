Asahina, in desperate fury, storms violently into the palace grounds, seizing the remaining soldiers and Hirota's men, wringing their necks.

【Dialogue】
Open this gate! Open it! What a nuisance - I'll break it down! Hey, what's this!

The large attacking force was struck down one after another, and before anyone knew it, they had reached the Kamakura palace itself.

This is what one would expect from Kobayashi. Everyone fled inside the gates, barricading them tightly shut, with crowds from within clinging to keep them closed. However, what should the fierce warrior Kobayashi fear? With his tremendous strength, he broke through the gates, and thousands of corpses lay scattered throughout the palace halls - the carnage was beyond description.

【Dialogue of the samurai trying to stop Asahina inside the palace】
If this position is broken through, we'll have no way left to fight!

Hold him back! Hold him back!

Draw your...!?

My head is in danger!

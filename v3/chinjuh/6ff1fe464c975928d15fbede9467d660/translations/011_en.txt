Asahina arrived at a certain island and looked around in all directions. "I shall enjoy another smoke," he said, and with a large pipe made of ten joined sections,

he lit tobacco and was enjoying the scenery when, strangely enough, what looked like bean-sized people in the form of

foreigners came rushing over in great numbers, making a commotion. So he thought, "This must be the island of little people."

On the island of little people, they spotted the smoke from Asahina's tobacco,

and thinking "This is no ordinary matter," officials and administrators on horseback came rushing over with a large crowd in tow.

【Dialogue of the little people of the island】
"Yanya, yanya! What terrible smoke! It's on top of that mountain over there!"

"Hau hau, hiu hiu"

"Henko henko"

"Hurry, hurry! Hai hai hai hai!"

"Is the mountain on fire? Tontaka suu suu"

"Chau chau"

"Yoro yoro"

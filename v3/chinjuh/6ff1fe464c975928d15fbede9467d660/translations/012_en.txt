【Asahina's dialogue】
"Ah, this is difficult to cross. I hope I don't break them by stepping on them."

【Dialogue of the people of Long Arm Island】

Please cross without worry.

Our arms are as strong as metal. We always cross this way in our daily lives.

Since birth, our arms were born first."

"Kyu kyu, kuma kuma, buu"

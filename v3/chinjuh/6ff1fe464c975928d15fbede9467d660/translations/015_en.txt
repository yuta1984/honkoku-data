Asahina, having been delayed at the Island of Imperial Consorts, boarded his boat and crossed over to Oni Island, where he demonstrated his heroic strength to the demons.

【Asahina's dialogue】
"Well, did you see my prowess?"

【Demons' dialogue】
"Ah, he's so strong! We can't match him anymore!"
"Ah, we're no match for him!"

【Main text continues】
The demons tried to test their strength by wrestling with Asahina, but none could match him. The demon chief became greatly enraged and tried to grab him in one grasp, but was thrown five or six ken away. He bowed three times to Asahina and fled.

【Demon's dialogue】
"When I was young, a strong warrior named Sakata no Kinpira came and conquered our island many times. Oh, how he frightened us!"

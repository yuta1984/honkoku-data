The monkey was told by the crab, "Please come for a chat in the evening," and had been looking forward to it since daytime. He had no idea in his dreams that there was a plot against him. Though he seemed quite tactful, the saying "clever monkey" is indeed well put.

Then a jellyfish came along. The ancestors of the two were on familiar terms. Regarding the monkey's matter, the jellyfish was greatly affected, and through his parent's [unclear characters], the son jellyfish was also talkative. He caught wind of loose talk about what great matter might befall this monkey, and came rushing all the way from Ryukyu to inform the monkey.

[The monkey] was startled and his heart sank. It truly appears that monkeys are creatures whose hearts are easily affected.

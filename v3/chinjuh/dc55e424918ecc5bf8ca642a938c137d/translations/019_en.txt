The crab was kicked for speaking of innocent troubles, but as it became clear that gods dwell above the heads of honest folk, now even the monkey turned his face bright red and earnestly apologized for their past relationship. Moreover, with the crab's care, the married couple's relationship was restored and they prospered harmoniously.

In the stories for children, it is told backwards that the crab defeated the monkey's enemy - this is mistaken. For the spring entertainment of women, we have sought out the true account and humbly present it for your viewing. A thousand autumns and ten thousand years - cranes, turtles, monkeys, and crabs - how auspicious, how auspicious!

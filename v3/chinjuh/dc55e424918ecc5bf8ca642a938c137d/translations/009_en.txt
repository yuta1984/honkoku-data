The monkey was alarmed by the jellyfish's warning and decided to elope with his wife and three daughters. He packed even useless things into one furoshiki cloth bundle. This is called "monkey showman's equipment." After eloping, the controls in his hometown became strict, so he thought that Edo would be better after all. Without any particular destination in mind, he left his hometown.

When you get tired, drink some spring water.

The family of three headed to Edo. Without settling down properly - these weren't troublesome people being sought by the magistrate's attention. If they were discovered, it would mean their end. There was a precedent with monkeys in the past. A man called Sajihei traveled around Shikoku and became a monkey. Thinking that if he traveled as a monkey he might become human again, he left his daughter with his wife and departed as a pilgrim - how pitiful this was.

The eel lived in a beautiful residence at the lumber yard in Fukagawa and could speak with the wealthy merchants. Originally he was slippery and evasive, but being employed in Fukagawa, he became a master of delicious things. Since the crab had come to visit, he gulped it down, and the turtles at Mannen Bridge being familiar friends, he informed them. After hearing the crab's whole story from beginning to end, [the eel said] "What's the problem? Even thin pancakes or cow dung - surely [the monkey] carried such things on his back. There is also a grudge against that monkey, and father's tumor still pains in the yokan to this day. By all means, let us help you take revenge," lending his strength.

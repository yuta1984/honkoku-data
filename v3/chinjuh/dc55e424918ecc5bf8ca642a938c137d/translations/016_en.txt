The monkey's wife, knowing that the crab was outside, let him into the house and told him about her husband's situation. It was entirely a mistake, and the husband and wife were separated. "I have raised our daughter. Please look favorably upon these two, and I beg you to forgive my husband's actions," she pleaded.

The one who made the crab apologize so earnestly - that monkey - was this woman. Though the crab said it was difficult to hear about the whole situation, even the matter of abandoning a beloved child and fleeing arose from taking things too lightly. "From now on, when he returns, let us make peace," she said, and both mother and daughter rejoiced, and from then on their hearts were at ease.

From "the crab pinched a burdock root" to "the crab pinched a peach" - in people's malicious gossip [text unreadable due to binding], this is somehow unknowable.

"Kamisama Uchi ni ka" / Kani Gabō Hasanda (The Crab and the Monkey's Sandwich Story) - Volume 1 - "Okumura"

This is a story from "peaches and chestnuts take three years, persimmons take eight years."
A monkey picked up persimmon seeds. These
seemed to contain
moisture,
but the cooked rice that the crab
picked up was
worthless. However,
it was unclear whether it had been
dropped from someone's lunch box.
With the kind of attitude that would
pick up that cooked rice and
exchange it for persimmon seeds,
trading for persimmon seeds was
also amusing. However,
not knowing that
the cooked rice had gone sour,
it seemed that
the monkey was
decidedly stubborn
and proud.

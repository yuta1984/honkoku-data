The monkey somehow managed to become a geisha, earning money on pleasure boats for evening cool, allowing his mother to live comfortably. He rejoiced that having a daughter was better than having a son. The crab wanted to search for the monkey but had no clues. When the turtle recommended "come for some evening cool," he loaded the crab on his back and set out. In the past he carried the monkey, now he carries the crab. What we call fate is indeed a curious thing.

Master, look at Yoshino. There are beautiful ones there.

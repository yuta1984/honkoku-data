Even with three crabs together, no wisdom of Manjushri emerged. When told "burdock root for the monkey's bottom," they first thought it distasteful, and though they debated various ways of roasting it, they understood nothing at all. Taking a raw one, when the crab waited at the monkey's gate, many children spotted him and chanted, "At the god's house, a crab has pinched a burdock root!"

Later, when people say "a crab pinched a burdock root," it sounds like poisonous gossip or malicious talk, but the truth is that it was done to inform the gods - let them see! That's how it was, that's how it should be.

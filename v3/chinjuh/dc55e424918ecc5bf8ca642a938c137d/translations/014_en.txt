Coming up from Ryogoku, waiting to follow them home by going back and forth along the stone embankment at a place called Manabe Wharf, the boat docked at Yanagi Bridge.

It's well said that "the crab digs holes resembling roof tiles." Knowing the parent's whereabouts from the daughter's facial features, he returned toward their dwelling to take revenge on his enemy. However, the monkey had long been a master tree climber - gentle methods would certainly not work.

However, carrots when roasted can sometimes serve as cough medicine.

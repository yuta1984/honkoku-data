The crab recovered from his illness and, feeling deeply resentful and wanting revenge, gathered his friends for consultation. They said, "Then we should call the monkey."

When they approached the hearth, chestnuts and eggs jumped out and burned him. When he thrust his hands into the rice bran paste, there were needles inside, which crushed his spirit. As he tried to flee, he was made to slip on cow dung and seaweed, whereupon a mortar came flying down and fell, and a pestle struck his head and knocked him down.

"Restrain him here," they said, and both Honzo and Yuranosuke said "Go over there" - it's all just incomprehensible talk.

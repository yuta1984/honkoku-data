The crab was very
logical and reasoning, so
when he planted the persimmon seeds he had traded with the monkey,
they grew into a large tree and in the eighth year bore
abundant fruit. "The persimmon seeds I traded with you
have borne fruit for
the first time this year," he
said.
The monkey came to see and said,
"I'm good at
climbing trees,
let me try."
"The good ones go to you,
and the crab gets only
the bad, inferior
ones
thrown at him."

【Monkey】
"Let me peel
one for you.
But with those
pincers,
you can't peel them."

【Crab】
"Unlike you,
I cannot peel them
with teeth."

The monkey found out about the situation and heard that the crab was now taking care of [his wife]. In great jealousy, he stomped forward angrily, his face flushed red, and his monkey eyes became fierce. The monkey himself now fancies himself a sophisticated man, and thinking it would be good fortune to catch up with the crab. The idea that the crab would take a burdock root to strike back at the monkey is misguided. Even in the past, such complicated matters were known to be lies - complete lies. The monkey's bottom, seizing the opportunity... his plan to foist his tiresome wife onto the crab - the monkey's bottom is bright red indeed. Roast the burdock and chase after him! This logic becomes clear as crystal.

【Monkey】
Since you won't understand if I call my wife a monkey, I shall divorce her!

The poor crab, when someone borrows [something] and scratches his head, thinking it's a person's hand, gets pinched.
〽Thinking he's become a sophisticated man, how insufferably arrogant - how disgusting!

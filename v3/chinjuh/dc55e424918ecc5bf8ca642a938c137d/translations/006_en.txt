The monkey not only
threw astringent persimmons
at the crab
but threw them violently,
breaking
the crab's
shell -
this incident
is known by every
child throughout
Japan,
without exception.
After this,
the crab became seriously ill,
so his close
friends came
to visit him.
Unlike
the present world, the
social relationships of that
time

were quite
charming.
The crab said: "Relationships with intimate friends
are warm and friendly.
When I compose poems,
though they may sound false,
the stories of this
old one
who is three hundred fifty years old
were quite
comforting."

The crabs of these days
appear to be arrogant,
leaning on Buddhist scriptures.
Today's crabs
have never even seen
such scriptures.
However,
the crabs of old
have probably never
seen Chinese
desks either.

A mortar
and pestle,
two companions
together,
come to visit.
These are
sworn
brothers.

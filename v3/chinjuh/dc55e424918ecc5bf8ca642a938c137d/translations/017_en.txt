In all matters, there are things that cannot be pushed when one tries to push them. The monkey traveled around Shikoku and became human. One would assume he would search for his wife and daughter, but hearing about the crab's situation, he abandoned them, disguised his appearance, and though his voice became hoarse like salted fish, he groaned a little and with quite an arrogant attitude became a male entertainer called Maru-dayū. Though that may not have been his intention.

This monkey Maru-dayū is also amusing. As they say, "even bugs that eat knotweed have their preferences" - some become busy because their skills are good, others become popular even with poor skills because they're entertaining. The logic is the same whether one is beautiful or clumsy - both can sell.

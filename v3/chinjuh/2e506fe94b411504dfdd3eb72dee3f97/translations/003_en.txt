Biography of Kobo Daishi (Kukai), Volume 1

In the land of Shikoku, in Sanuki Province, Tado District, at Shirakata Byobu-ga-ura, there lived a fisherman named Fujin-dayu. In his household was a woman called Akoya. This woman was a princess of the great king of Tang China, but because she was the most evil woman in the three countries, her father the great king put her in an empty boat and cast her adrift on the sea. When she reached Shirakata Byobu-ga-ura, Fujin-dayu rescued her and cared for her well. However, even after many years of marriage, they had no children, which grieved them greatly. So they went to Nakayama Temple in Settsu Province for a twenty-one day retreat, praying earnestly with all their heart and soul, "Please grant us even one child, whether boy or girl." On the night of the twenty-first day, Akoya had a dream in which a golden fish from the western sea entered her womb. She accepted this dream with boundless joy, performed thirty-three prostrations before the Buddha, and hurried back to her homeland. In the third year, she became pregnant. While ordinary humans remain in the womb for nine months, the Great Master was no ordinary person, so he was born after thirteen months. The era name at that time was Hoki 5 (774 CE), year of the Wood Horse, and he was born on the 15th day of the 6th month at the hour of the Tiger.

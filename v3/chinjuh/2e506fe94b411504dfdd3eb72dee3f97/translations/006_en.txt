He composed a poem: "Though there is no fixed form for becoming a Buddha, it is not the physical form but the heart that becomes [enlightened]." The era name at that time was Enryaku 23, year of Kinoe-Saru (804 CE). In Tang China, he met Master Keika (Huiguo) of Shōryūji (Qinglong Temple) and said, "I, Kūkai of Japan, have come this far." The master was pleased.

Now, Keika had reached the age of 580 years and had a thousand disciples. He gathered those thousand people to read ten thousand volumes of sutras, and as an offering, had a golden stupa made, thirty-three fathoms high and pentagonal in shape. He declared that whoever could write on this stupa would be designated as his first disciple, and that he would transfer to the temple the five treasures he had practiced with for 580 years.

Among them, Keika's first disciple, a monk named Keishitsu, climbed the stupa and was about to write on it when Kūkai observed this and said, "How interesting! Is this the custom of great countries? Though our country is small, I have heard of riding in boats, carts, and on oxen and horses, but this is the first time I have seen someone climb a stupa." He laughed, and the thousand disciples became angry, saying, "Fear that Japanese monk!" Kūkai heard this and said, "Though my strength may be insufficient, I shall write it for you to see." He chanted the Ajari mantra and raised his left hand toward the golden [stupa] thirty-three fathoms high.

Here in the mountains of Tanba Province lives an old goblin who has dwelt there for many years, known even to the spirits who show their faces from Hakone. In recent years, he has become unfashionable and is no longer feared by people, though he doesn't particularly try to devise ways to frighten them either. Without changing his ancient name of "mōryō" (demon spirit), he lived quietly. Around that time, a ghost came to live in the mountains of Tanba. Eventually, this ghost and the mōryō became close, revealing their innermost feelings to each other and loving freely, until finally it seemed the ghost's belly had grown strange.

"Even if this body should vanish or live on, please pity us as unfortunate souls who cannot achieve salvation or recite nembutsu together with you."

"What a creature with hands instead of feet!"

"I don't desire the hairpins of heaven, nor do I wish to wear five layered robes. Could there be such an advantageous wife as this? And since what we lack has been absent for so long, anything goes now."

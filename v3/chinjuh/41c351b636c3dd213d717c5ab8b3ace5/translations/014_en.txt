As is customary,
Most auspiciously (repeated)

The honest old man
[regarding] the greedy old woman
The sparrow

Said that it was the natural principle for [even a wronged sparrow] to encourage good-heartedness,
and thus made her reform her heart. Therefore, the old woman
became a maidservant and served diligently, the daughter
took a husband and prospered,
welcoming an auspicious spring—
how auspicious! (repeated)

Misfortune and good fortune have no fixed gates - they are what people bring upon themselves. Many people ruin their lives through "three inches of tongue" (careless words), and this is all the doing of greed. As a moral teaching of encouraging good and punishing evil, this red book tells the tale passed down with the words "Where is the dwelling of Master Tongue-Cut Sparrow? Tweet tweet," delighting children's eyes and ears. It demonstrates the karmic retribution of misfortune and fortune, showing that the mouth is the gate of disaster, and because its root was cut, this masterwork that illustrates the principle remains an enduring folk tale to this day - a story of lifelong prosperity, provided merely as something to ward off sleepiness.

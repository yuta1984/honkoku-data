After Momoemon's wife ate the peach, she became pregnant, so Momoemon was greatly delighted, saying "This must surely be a child bestowed by the Queen Mother of the West." He counted on his fingers waiting for the months to pass.

Before long, she reached full term and gave safe birth to a son beautiful as a jewel, but strangely, this child was a baby with two heads.

♪ The "Ryōmen Nendaiki" (Chronicle of Two Faces) records that "in Yamashiro Province, a child with two heads was born" - this must be of the same kind.

♪ At first, Momoemon was surprised by his wife and household members making such a great commotion.

"Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my"

The "Sancai Tuhui" (Illustrated Compendium of the Three Powers) states: "The deity of Mount Yōrei has the form of a human but with two heads, and is called Kyōchū." Since the creative power of heaven and earth is limitless, one cannot say that two-headed people do not exist.

The two-headed baby cries "wah wah" in alternation.

【Midwife's dialogue】
♪ Well now, what a strange child this is. With two heads... it would be good to display it at a sideshow, wouldn't it? That would be profitable.

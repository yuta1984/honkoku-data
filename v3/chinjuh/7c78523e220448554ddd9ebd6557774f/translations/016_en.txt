Like the metaphor of how sleeping and waking affects one's own body, the evil head had long tormented the good head, causing pain and hardship even to their shared body. From this point on, the two heads became greatly at odds.

When the good head wanted to eat rice, the evil head wanted to tie up his hair. When the good head became cold from fatigue and wanted to put on clothing, the evil head would bare one shoulder and use a fan. When the good head wanted to go to temple, the evil head wanted to go fishing. When the evil head tried to drink sake with first bonito sashimi, the good head ate tea over rice with dried fish.

Everything was contradictory and chaotic - despite being their own body, it would not follow their own will, becoming a greatly inconvenient body.

"I think that human hearts often have such examples as well. When one's own heart torments one's own body, and one's own body does not follow one's heart's desires - all of this is because one's heart is not righteous."

"When a person's heart becomes sticky like this, it's like riding on a shared boat - truly inconvenient."

【Maid's dialogue】
"Is the bath water satisfactory now?"

【Evil head's dialogue】
"How can such lukewarm water be used! Don't spare the firewood - make it much hotter!"

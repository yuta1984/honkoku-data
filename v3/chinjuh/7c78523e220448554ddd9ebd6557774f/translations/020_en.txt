Thus, as the evil head withered and fell away, he truly became an ordinary person.

By Santō Kyōden

The good head increasingly entered the true path, devoted himself to filial piety toward his parents, accomplished his family business, practiced compassion, abandoned fame and profit to cultivate virtue, so that day by day his household and person prospered, and he welcomed an auspicious spring.

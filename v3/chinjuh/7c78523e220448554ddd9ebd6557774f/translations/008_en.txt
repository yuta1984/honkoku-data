As this two-headed boy grew up, the evil-faced head came to prefer sake, while the good-faced head preferred mochi (rice cakes). When one considers this, sake is among the evil things of food. Mochi is among the good things of food. The reason for this is that sake was named "mad medicine" by the ancients, also called "heartless water," and commonly called "crazy water," as it disturbs people's hearts. Afterward, even small people (children) who drink it immediately become bold, lose money, suffer illness, bring about disasters, and ultimately harm their bodies and destroy their homes. All this is because the nature of sake is evil. Even if one drinks a little, one should not drink too much.

Moreover, no one has heard of people who destroyed their bodies and homes by eating mochi. Therefore, mochi must be a good thing. With soba noodles or sweet bean mochi, there should be no loss of body or cause for worry.

Momouemon hated that the evil head liked sake, cherished the good head, and occasionally fed it mochi.

The mother was lenient with the child because she had picked up a sweet peach, while the father, having eaten a bitter peach, raised the child strictly and taught that good medicine tastes bitter.

This boy's evil head likes sake while the good head prefers mochi. This too must be an example of Heaven's way of admonishing people.

In any case, mothers tend to raise children poorly through their excessive sweetness. Momouemon's wife, drowning in love for her child, did not restrain the evil head's fondness for sake, occasionally hiding it from the father to let it drink, and instead came to hate the good head. This kind of misguided thinking is common among people who raise children in this world.

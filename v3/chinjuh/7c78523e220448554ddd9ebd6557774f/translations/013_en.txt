When a household's prosperity declines, it can be discerned by whether one rises early or late in the morning - this saying by Master Kaibara is quite reasonable.

The good head rises early every morning and sets to work on the day's business, but the evil head always prefers sleeping in late, still dreaming even when the good head is eating lunch. It is rare for people who love sleeping late to succeed in life. One should be cautious of this.

【Good head's dialogue】
"I'll make sure you don't suffer any loss from this, so please forgive me."

【Peddler's dialogue】  
"If you say so, then I certainly won't insist unreasonably."

The good head does not spare money for others' benefit, but does not waste even one sen when it comes to business matters.

The evil head not only neglects the family business but also spends money like water, and each time makes the good head clean up the mess.

【Evil head's dream】
"If only the good head would not wake up for four or five days!"

"While the good head isn't awake, let me quickly use this money I found to celebrate!"

【Evil head's sleep talk】
"Huff huff, mumble mumble mumble"

"Mother stops him"
"Oh, please forgive me. Today is the memorial day of our ancestors, so if that's the case, everything the good head does will come to nothing."
"The evil head was extremely short-tempered and selfish, treating the household servants harshly, and even for small mistakes would beat them, so that evil thoughts increased day by day."
"The good head always favored compassion and good words, and every morning through religious practice, or alms-giving to beggars and outcasts, would give from his means, and also show pity for the poor, thus cultivating much virtue."

"However, even as the good head practiced compassion, the evil head would create sins. All human hearts are like this, and it is something we should be cautious about."

[Dialogue of the beggars]
"Rice would be exceptional - if it's four-mon coins, please give us one mon instead. I'm making a monetary offering to the temple bell."

[Dialogue of the good-natured head]
"Little one, my hands are small and cannot hold much. I shall give you two handfuls each."

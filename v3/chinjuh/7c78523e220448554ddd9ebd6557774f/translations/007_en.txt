The couple Momoemon and his wife, having had a two-headed son, were greatly saddened. Since it is human nature to feel pity for one's own child, they thought that after he grew up, they would make him become a monk to expiate the sins of parent and child, and so they carefully embraced, cherished, and raised him.

【Wife's dialogue】
♪This child needs to drink milk from four breasts to be satisfied.

As this child grew up, the right head was fair-skinned with a well-defined nose, handsome features, and a refined countenance born naturally to him. The left head was dark-skinned with a flat nose and large eyes, and had an extremely evil appearance.

The fact that the peach this mother had picked up the previous year - one sweet and one bitter - was probably a sign that she would bear such a deformed child.

【Evil head's dialogue】
♪Sparrows are building a nest on the warehouse roof. Let's finish calligraphy practice quickly and catch them. Ah, how boring this is.

【Good head's dialogue】
Calligraphy practice is like pushing a cart up a hill - one must not be careless, as our teacher said.

♪I think that having been born with two heads divided into good and evil, right and wrong in this way, this is probably Heaven's parable to admonish people.

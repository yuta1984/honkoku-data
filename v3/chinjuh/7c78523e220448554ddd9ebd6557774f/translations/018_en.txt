Jizo Bodhisattva and the demon fought with each other and came to the boundary between hell and paradise, pulling the two heads along. Jizo Bodhisattva took out medicinal paralysis powder and applied white medicine to the right arm belonging to the good head. The demon quickly took out nail pullers and tried to pull out the tongue of the evil head. Though they fought like this, since there was only one body, there was nothing to be done. King Enma and Jizo Bodhisattva consulted and decided: "For now, we shall forgive and return him to the mortal world. If the evil head continues to commit more sins, both the good head and evil head shall be cast into hell. But if the good head practices even more good words, we shall forgive the evil head's past sins and guide them both to paradise." Thus he was returned to the mortal world, and the dream ended.

Even if one does good to all people, great evil causes one to lose that merit. Even if one commits sins in the morning, if one repents in the evening, one immediately becomes a good person. If one wishes to move from evil to good, it is possible. One should quickly abandon evil and advance toward good - this is what Jizo Bodhisattva earnestly taught.

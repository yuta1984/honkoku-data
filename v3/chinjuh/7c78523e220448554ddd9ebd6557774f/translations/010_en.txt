The pleasant sound quickly passed, and this son soon underwent his coming-of-age ceremony. His evil and good countenances became increasingly prominent - the left head was entirely like a villain in a play, while the right head was like an honest character. There was another strange thing: when evil thoughts arose in this son's heart, the good head would continuously doze off, and when good thoughts arose in his heart, the evil head would continuously sleep. The way good and evil in people's hearts change from day to day must all be like this.

"Be quite well-behaved now."

When people work diligently at their trade and keep themselves busy with no spare time, evil thoughts do not arise. When they take it easy and become negligent and idle, evil thoughts naturally arise and they commit various wrongdoings - it is all like this.

The evil head said:
"Hey, good head, enough with the bookkeeping! This isn't just your body alone. I'm tired from doing what I want and I'm getting sleepy."
"The good head works diligently at business and never neglects anything."
"This month we've spent quite a lot of pocket money. This won't do at all. We must also be mindful of the household budget."

One night, the two heads had a dream for two people. In that dream, Jizo Bodhisattva suddenly appeared and tried to take the good head, saying "Come, I shall lead you to paradise." Then a red demon came and tried to drag the evil head to hell. Since there were two heads but one body, it was difficult to settle which way to go, and they began to quarrel with each other.

The demon said:
"This evil head has committed various sins, so King Enma has ordered me to bring it without fail. Let go there and hand it over to me."

Jizo Bodhisattva said:
"This good head has practiced various good words and compassion, so I must guide it to paradise. Well, that won't happen."

The demon said:
"If you don't hand this one over, I'll gouge out the white tuft of hair (urna) from your forehead and make it into a cord tie!"

Jizo Bodhisattva said:
"If you talk such nonsense, what's this - I'll take your loincloth and make it into a drawstring purse!"

One night, while the good head was sleeping soundly, the evil head secretly crept in, stole money, and ran off. The good head was startled by the noise, woke up, and tried to stop him, causing the two heads to fight fiercely.

The evil head says:
"Damn, how impudent! What are you doing there? Hand over this money to me!"

"The left foot and hand side with the evil head and work to run away"

The good head says:
"I won't let you use the money I earned through my own hard work! Hand that money over here!"

"Both: No way!"

The evil head seized the money, and the evil head said:
"Just when I thought I could spend freely and enjoy myself to the fullest, the good head discovered me. In great anger, he grabbed the good head's hair"

"Living in one body with a head like mine for many years as companions, finally inflicting wounds on the forehead. This is a parable showing how a person's state of mind can cause one's own heart to torment one's own body. Many people have such examples. This should be taken as a warning."

"At this time, because evil thoughts filled the entire body, both left and right hands sided with the evil head, subjecting the good head to terrible treatment"

"The good head tried to flee quickly, but being the same body, this was impossible, and finally received wounds"

【Father Momoemon's dialogue】
"Even sibling quarrels are unacceptable, so what is this fighting within one body?"

The evil head says:
"Living in one body with a head like mine, I have never once been able to drink sake with a peaceful heart. How stingy and pathetic!"

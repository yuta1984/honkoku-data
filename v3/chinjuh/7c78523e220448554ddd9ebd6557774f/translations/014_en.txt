When praying to gods and buddhas, if one purifies the heart and worships with single-minded devotion without evil thoughts, there will surely be divine blessings. However, if one makes selfish and unreasonable wishes, trying to make gods and buddhas accomplices to evil thoughts, and furthermore allows the heart to wander toward beautiful women of the three realms, harboring lustful thoughts - with such a defiled heart, no matter how benevolent the gods and buddhas may be, there can be no reason for receiving their benefits.

The evil head says:
"My, what a beautiful maiden! She turned to look this way. I wish I could create some connection so she might fancy me, but it's unfortunate that the good head is praying and my hands are occupied."

The good head says:
"Grant family prosperity, prosperity of descendants, good health and long life, and deliverance from evil deeds and disasters. Namu Daiki Kanzeon (Hail to the Great Compassionate Avalokiteshvara)."

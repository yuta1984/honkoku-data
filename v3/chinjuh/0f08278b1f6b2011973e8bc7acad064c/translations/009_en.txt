"Did you not know that Imai is among Lord Kiso's retainers? What a formidable thing! I shall make the plains of Awazu into a mountain of corpses. Ariya, ariya, ariya!"

Imai Shirō Kanehira, hearing that Yoshinaka had been struck down, said:

"Now this is the end. Come, I shall show my final prowess and astound the eyes of the Kamakura forces." He charged into the cloud formation, crossed his weapons in a cruciform pattern, rode through them, struck down many enemies, and met a spectacular death in battle.

Ishida Saburō tried to strike down Lord Kiso, but fled in fear of (Imai's) martial prowess.

"He's a strong one! Pursue him!"

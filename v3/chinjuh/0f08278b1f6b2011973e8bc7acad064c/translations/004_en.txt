Asahi Shogun Kiso Yoshinaka summoned Date, Nei, and Higuchi, and commanded them, "Judge the auspicious or inauspicious meaning of this dream."

"The character for 'sheep' (羊) consists of eight strokes plus the character for 'king' (王), and when parts are missing, it brings profit. The eight strokes represent the missing horns, and the profit represents the tail. If the two tails are broken off and removed, what remains is the character for 'king' (王). Your lordship will surely ascend to the imperial throne of ten virtues and ten thousand chariots without doubt." With such flattering and deceitful rhetoric, they fawned upon him. Yoshinaka was greatly pleased, and from this point forward, his evil ambitions grew ever stronger.

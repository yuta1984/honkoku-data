Now, Imai Shirō Kanehira had repeatedly offered various admonitions to Yoshinaka, but the words of flatterers are sweet like honey, while the words of loyal retainers are bitter like good medicine. Yoshinaka instead became angry and banished him, so Kanehira had no choice but to withdraw into seclusion, spending day and night agonizing in his heart, praying "somehow may he return to his true nature."

【People on the street's dialogue】
"Terrible things are starting again. Then we must (flee)... Just when we thought things had been a bit (peaceful) lately. The Heike are a matter for later - first the Kamakura forces are advancing like clouds and mist to strike down Lord Kiso."

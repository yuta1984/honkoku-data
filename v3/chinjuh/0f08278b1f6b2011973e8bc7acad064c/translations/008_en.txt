Around the end of the first month (Mutsuki), word of Kiso Yoshinaka's plot reached Kamakura, so strike forces immediately advanced upward. Though they held them at the Uji River, they were outflanked by Sasaki and Kajiwara, suffered devastating defeats, and now retreat toward Awazu.

【Kiso Yoshinaka's dialogue】
"Date and Nei, whom I trusted completely, have died in battle, so all is in vain. I shall meet my fate with dignity. You must flee to wherever you can, safely bear the male child in your womb, raise him, and let him make a name for himself in future generations, Tomoe."

【Lady Tomoe's dialogue】
"How sad, how sad."

Yoshitsune's forces advance like clouds and mist. Feeling utterly alone, he retreats toward the pine grove with only a single horseman.

【Kanehira's dialogue】
"Ever since I incurred your displeasure and was banished from your residence, I have hidden myself near Yodo. As soon as I heard your situation was perilous, I rushed here, only to meet you unexpectedly in this place. You retreat in such a pitiful state, defeated without even putting up a fight. How did you become such a coward? How shameful!"

【Yoshinaka's dialogue】
"In this disgraceful state, I have no honor left. I shall die in battle with dignity."

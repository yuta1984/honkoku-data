Here, Takeda Gorō Nobumitsu, who bore a grudge against Yoshimori, suddenly attacked, but he could not match Asahina's prowess and was thoroughly defeated. As he tried to flee, Yoshihide suddenly grabbed his kusazuri (armor skirt) and pulled him back, then killed him.

[Main text]
The world thinks this was the kusazuri-pulling incident between Soga Gorō and Asahina at Wada's drinking party, but at the time of Wada's drinking party, Yoshimori was born in the third year of Kyūan and was forty-four years old. Also, Asahina was born in the second year of Angen and was eighteen years old. Soga Gorō was twenty-two years old at that time.

[Dialogue]
"Did you see the extent of Yoshihide's prowess?"

"Ouch, ouch! Being kicked and trampled—what are you doing? Just kill me, kill me!"

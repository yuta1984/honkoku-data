Flea-bitten, mountain spirit, crow
"I thought it would end up like this"
Hitokoto-zaka, Nakabashi, Kyobashi, Oman's rouge
Sacred jewel dagger
Long-tailed bird of Naratsu forest
Ceiling-watching hawk
Red of the four directions, sweet potato, dorayaki pancake
Each with apologetic words at Chagamagawa
"Our lives are saved, we humbly apologize"

Not heeding
Lord Tea-kettle's words,
now we have
no face to show
before Lord Tea-kettle
lately

"These fellows are unruly, but without them there would be difficulties for the kusazoshi illustrated books. This time, please show mercy to me and spare their lives."
Just as Kimpira was about to kill all the monsters,
Tea-kettle rushed in and begged for their lives for old time's sake,
so he spared their lives and gave them advice: "Since this is an age of contemporary wit and humor, we have included lowly characters like you even in kusazoshi. In the old kusazoshi from when we first appeared, we never used base language, but works like 'Snow Story' and 'Monkey Genji' all quoted classical poetry. Therefore, you should be grateful that creatures like you are now included in kusazoshi stories, and you must be very careful from now on."

"They are detestably hateful creatures, but without them, the appeal of kusazoshi would be diminished."

The third act features Mount Mikake's
dried crows, dorayaki pancakes, Kashima
dance, contrived yokan sweet jellies -
I'd like Master Gara to praise them

In the miso soup of song books,
one red sheet of reading books
Reading Mount Mikake's
watchman crow
Chobo yare~ yare~

Yare~ yare~

Please

That person -
initially taking on the role of a calligrapher,
with no end in sight, feeling regretful, thinking
of some inspiration, but
having no real inspiration,
the guardian of sweet potatoes, just a freeloader on the left

With that
hand, taking
the half-ground [substance]
and throwing it
away, saying
this body has no real
inspiration
at all

♪Now with those cold
hands, if only I had
run away more
quickly
The half-ground [substance]
tries to escape
from the body,
pulling
　　　backward

Looking at the clothing of Goromaru and his retainers recorded in this volume, one feels as if witnessing firsthand the transformation of society during the time when Lord Shirakawa served as regent. The conception of this entire work skillfully penetrates the fashions of the time. This manor owner (Shiien) once possessed this booklet, and recently obtained another copy which he presented to me. However, while this manor owner's collection includes the author's preface, postscript, and table of contents, this copy lacks them. Therefore, I supplement them here.

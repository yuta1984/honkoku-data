Preface by the Author
Now, since the reign of Lord Yoritomo, what has flourished most greatly is Ōiso alone. Beginning with Tora-shōshō, numerous courtesans competed in beauty, and while many guests frequented this place, Kajiwara's maliciousness caused him to mistake the arrow-nock of his evening lodging, Kobayashi's conceit led him to stroke his whiskers on both sides, Sukenari's hangover produced an unsteady gait, and Tokimune's fits of anger would crush the metal bowl of his tobacco pipe. Where there was Kudō in his haori jacket, there were also geishas in haori; where there were the young men who were brothers, there were also the courtesans who were their shinko attendants.

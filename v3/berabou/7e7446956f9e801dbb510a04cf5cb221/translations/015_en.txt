"Those who cultivate virtue receive blessings"
"Though wealthy, do not forget poverty"

In families that accumulate good deeds, there will always be surplus blessings. Even when wealthy, not forgetting one's poverty, and even when pressed by poverty, not losing one's aspirations - this is a true virtuous person. Long ago, there was a man named Han Xin who served under Emperor Gaozu of Han. Though his status was humble, he was employed by Gaozu and became a great general, destroyed Chu and unified the realm, and was enfeoffed as King of Qi. When Han Xin was of humble status, he was extremely hungry and relied on a commoner's house, where an old woman gave him rice balls to stave off his hunger. Therefore, after Han Xin was enfeoffed as king, he sought out that old woman and gave her great rewards.

When an inchworm wants to move, it first contracts its body. Indeed, a hawk that hides its talons - there is no shame unless it exceeds what should be shameful. "Great achievements do not concern themselves with small profits" - these are Fan Kuai's words. Indeed, even when one's body is poor, not forgetting poverty is like Han Xin's friendship. What do you think, children? Carelessly, did Han Xin crawl between someone's legs again? When China's comedy becomes like this, Heaven bestows golden cauldrons. There is no case where those who do good do not receive blessings. Listen well to what grandfather says.

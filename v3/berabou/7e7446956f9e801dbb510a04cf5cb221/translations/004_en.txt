On the morning when the new year dawned, with doors left open to welcome the New Year's pine decorations, bamboo companions, and the millennium, the children playing their innocent games in their own various ways - this too follows the theory of innate human goodness and is something to be cherished. However, for this very reason, "In the darkness of ignorance, even the lantern of a bald head is dim, and even cranes that live a thousand years think of their origins - to raise a child without teaching is a parent's fault. To teach without having them practice, without loving oneself, is futile" - these were the golden words of Master Shiba.

Long, long ago, there was an honest man who constantly loved children, so everyone called him "Master Hotei." Because he cherished children who had few desires and were innocent, the children grew fond of him and always came to play. During the long spring days, to pass the time, they would play with handballs linked together, shoot birds with the ceremonial bow at the temple grounds, and other mischief - blindfolding themselves instead of learning. Eventually, demons would cross their hearts. Indeed, the human heart is like a mirror - sometimes it clouds over. When good and evil are reflected, nothing fails to appear. So he gathered many children and produced a small book, saying: "This has been called Jitsugokyo since ancient times - it is a teaching text for children. If you merely recite it with your mouth but don't practice it in your heart, it's no different from a parrot mimicking human speech. Therefore, let me provide this illustrated explanation to lead you from innocence to an even more innocent path." Like adding tail to tail of the copper pheasant of the mountains, he spoke at great length in a playful manner so the children wouldn't get bored.

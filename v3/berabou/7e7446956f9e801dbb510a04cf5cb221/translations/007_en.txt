"Wealth in the storehouse may decay (kura no uchi no zai wa kutsuru koto ari)"
"Talent within oneself never decays (mi no uchi no sai wa kutsuru koto nashi)"

Money and possessions are secondary things. Just because you have them doesn't mean you truly possess them. True treasure means that those who have mastered wisdom and the six arts are the real wealthy ones. No matter how rich a person may be, when they die, it all amounts to just a few coins. Those with talent and wisdom leave their teachings for a thousand generations even after death.

In ancient China during the Jin period, there was a man named Zhang Yi who was skilled in wit and eloquence, but he could not find employment and wandered in poverty for six years. His wife said, "When will you achieve success and give us peace of mind?" Zhang Yi stuck out his tongue to show her. His wife was startled by this display and asked, "So you don't hope for success?" Zhang Yi laughed and asked, "Do I still have my tongue?" His wife replied, "Are you mad? What would you do without your tongue?" Zhang Yi answered, "As long as I live, my success is not far away." Indeed, he later achieved high rank. This is talent within oneself.

Also in China, there was a scoundrel named Yuan Ji who would lie on the veranda and air out the insects of talent in his chest. This is why we still say "chest collar" (munagura) today - there is a storehouse in the chest. In any case, children, store the treasures of penmanship, abacus, and learning in the storehouse of your chest, and don't let anyone grab your chest collar. Secret meetings consume the tools within the chest, while people treasure the wisdom within their chests. Just close the doors of your chest storehouse and lock the storehouse - then there will be no rudeness from evil storehouses toward others, and no darkness in the storehouse of your own heart.

♪No matter how much you envy your father and mother and buy fine rice cake games, wealth in the storehouse may decay. Thus, the dead Zhuge Liang makes the living Sima Yi run. This shows that talent within oneself does not decay even in death.

[From here on, it plays with the names of Three Kingdoms characters]
Because Liu Bei Xuande had a bad dream, it must be something about the Marquis of Shouting. Let's ask Guan Yu about it. Was it bad? I thought Zhuge Liang would never come here alive, but what a surprise - Zhang Fei went mad and suffered like Wu. What a big mistake by Sun Quan. Should we kick Cao Cao?

♪The defeated Zhuge Liang in the neighboring country of Wu, yes, defeated

♪Does our general know he will be kicked? Making scary faces, thinking he's Sima Yi?

Forgive, forgive

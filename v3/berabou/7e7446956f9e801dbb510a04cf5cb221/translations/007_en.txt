"Wealth in the storehouse may decay (kura no uchi no zai wa kutsuru koto ari)
Talent within oneself never decays (mi no uchi no sai wa kutsuru koto nashi)"

Money and gold are secondary things. Having them doesn't truly matter. True treasure means that those who have mastered wisdom and the six arts are the true wealthy ones. No matter how rich one may be, upon death they are left with only six mon coins. Those with talent, even after death, leave teachings that remain for a thousand generations.

In ancient China during the Qin period, there was a man named Zhang Yi who was skilled in wisdom and eloquence, but could not find official employment and wandered in poverty for six years. His wife said, "When will you achieve success and give us peace of mind?" Zhang Yi stuck out his tongue to show her. When his wife looked puzzled, he asked "So you don't expect me to succeed?" Zhang Yi laughed and asked "Do I have my tongue?" His wife replied, "Have you gone mad? What would you do without a tongue? As long as you live, as long as you have your tongue, your success is not far off." Indeed, he later achieved high rank. This is the talent within oneself.

Also in China, there was Yuan Ji who would air out the talent-insects in his chest under the blazing sun. That's why even now we say "chest storehouse" - there is a storehouse in the chest. In any case, children, store the treasures of calligraphy practice, abacus, and writing in your chest storehouse, so that people cannot grab you by the chest.

If you do so, codes consume the tools within the chest, and people honor the wisdom within the chest. Just properly secure the chest storehouse and manage its contents, then there will be no bad examples for others and no darkness in your own heart.

♪Always cherish your father and mother. No matter how fine rice cakes or toys you buy, could the wealth in the storehouse decay? Yes, "the dead Zhuge Liang makes the living Sima Yi flee." This talent within oneself does not decay even in death.

Because Liu Bei Xuande had bad dreams, he said "This must be about the Marquis of Shou Pavilion." He sent Guan Yu to inquire. "Because things went badly, surely he wouldn't come here alive - I thought it was Zhuge Liang, but what a mistake that Zhang Fei went mad and met the same fate as Wu. What a great misunderstanding. Should we kick Cao Cao?"

♪How could it be Zhuge Liang from the neighboring state of Wu, cha...

♪Do you know that our general kicks? Do you think I'm Sima Yi because I make a scary face?

Forgive me, flee!

"Remove sleep and recite through the night" (Eliminate sleepiness and study through the night)
"Endure hunger and practice all day" (Bear hunger and study all day long)

The Chinese people, even when their homes were poor, would light lamps to study diligently and gather fireflies to read books without neglect. Che Yin would also stick an awl in his thigh to prevent himself from falling asleep. This too accords well with these teachings.

When studying now, one should follow these examples and also study with joy. The character for "practice/learn" (習) has "day" written under "wings." Like a bird in a cage that grows feathers day by day until it can finally leave the nest, one forms character through constant practice. To waste the time that should be spent learning—enduring sleepiness and bearing hunger—by spending it idly is inexcusable. Time passes faster than a cannonball with sails attached.

Calligraphy practice is like pushing a cart uphill—if you become lazy, you slide backward. As the ancients said, "Women need not have talent."

The character for "achievement" (功) is written with "craft/skill" plus "sword." Like forging a sword, one must well-train the sinews and bones of one's heart, or no achievement will be accumulated.

"I too want to accumulate achievements!"

"Though one meets with teachers but does not learn" (it is like) "merely facing people in the marketplace"
"Though one practices reading but does not review" (it is) "only like counting one's neighbor's wealth"

Even if you go to a teacher and receive instruction, if you don't truly learn, it's the same as not knowing—you have only the name of knowing, like merely facing passersby, which serves no purpose. Even Confucius said that if one doesn't think "How troubling!" then he too would say "There's nothing I can do about it." This is the beginning of failure. Also, even if you study but don't review, you'll forget everything—it's like counting your neighbor's treasure. "Quick as lightning" (literally "from eye to nose") is a metaphor for clever people, but "in one ear and out the other" (literally "from ear to rear") wouldn't even let a Lotus Sutra teacher's small blade pass through. We want to absorb knowledge well so it doesn't slip away, children!

That cat too is a performing cat—quite an accomplished creature!
The young man next door is also clever. The master is inexperienced, the clerk is knowledgeable, and bearing only the family fortune, even when going to borrow three mon, he says "five, two or two" and "five, three or three, three."

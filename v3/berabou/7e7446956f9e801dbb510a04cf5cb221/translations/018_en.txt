Like the straight bamboo and evergreen pine, with loose character in the long spring days, listening to Master Hotei's lectures (whose wisdom accumulated like the shell of a turtle), from whatever age one begins, one should become increasingly well-behaved, apply oneself diligently to learning, and truly develop a heart of filial piety toward one's parents. Children are like white thread - when dyed, they can be colored in all five colors. Untangling the confusion of those thread strands, appreciating both sweetness and bitterness with broad wisdom, even the wise must be considered according to their foundation when woven together.

Even horses are not merely horses - without loosening the reins on the steed of one's wayward heart, changing daily without negligence, still intoxicated with books: "You are indeed dutiful children who listen to what I say. If you can manage even that much, your whole life will be blessed."

"Now it's finished. Come again tomorrow. Make sure you don't act up badly."

"When taking leave, one should bow and speak properly, uncle."

"I will try not to be called a crybaby."
"Uncle, goodbye."
"I won't be selfish anymore."

"Mountains are not precious because they are high (yama takaki ga yue ni tattoka razu)
Having trees makes them precious (ki aru wo motte tattoshi to su)
People are not precious because they are fat (hito koetaru ga yue tattoka razu) 
Having wisdom makes them precious (chi aru wo motte tattoshi to su)"

Now, the meaning of this is: No matter how high a mountain may be, without trees it serves no purpose. No matter how much wood you cut and bring from the mountains, it never runs out. From palaces and towers above to commoners' huts below, without wood, houses cannot be built. Sometimes becoming pine firewood, sometimes bamboo baskets - all are treasures of benefit. No matter how high a mountain may be, without the trees that become treasure, it might as well not exist.

People are exactly the same way. Those who have no skills yet eat plenty of food, growing fat enough that you can see rice grains in their clenched fists - without wisdom, they are like "large but useless trees," impressive in appearance but serving no purpose. Long ago in China, there was a man named Yan Pingzhong who was small in stature and appeared worth no more than three coins, but he stored wisdom worth a thousand gold pieces in his heart. He rose from low status to high rank and extended his influence across the realm, though his face appeared wanting. At that time, the man who pulled Yan's cart was nearly ten feet tall, fat, and well-built by birth, but he had the expression of one who thought pulling carts was his natural lot. When his wife saw this from hiding, she felt shame toward her husband. "People are not precious because they are fat" - this is a similar story.

Also in China, at the end of the Later Han dynasty, there was a man named Dong Zhuo whose waist was so large he could never see his own navel, but his character was that of the worst villain, and he was eventually killed. As for Ginmatsuri, his belly was fat like mochi...

♪"The cart-puller's wife watching says:
'Lord Yan Pingzhong is such an ugly man
To think he has wisdom -
How shameful you are!'"

♪"Aside from mountains being precious for their height,
The only thing precious for having a high nose
Is Ebizo"

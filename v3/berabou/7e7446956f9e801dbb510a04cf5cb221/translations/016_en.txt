"Though noble, do not aspire to baseness"
"Sometimes first noble, then base"

Those who, while in noble positions, do not forget the humble - these can be called people who do not lose their foundation. "Once past the throat, one forgets the heat," "obtaining the rabbit, one forgets hunger" - these are things one should be cautious about. The great snow at Sano no Watari that prevented going forward or backward, and Lord Saimyoji's becoming a monk were not mere flattery like Kenzaemon's contemporary sarcasm.

The potted tree of plum, cherry, and pine - even for someone from Sankasho, though pressed by the poverty of a thin horse, immediately taking up the naginata and polishing off the rust from the armor. From the torn belly-wrap came spirited stories that even reached the lord's ears, so the snow's brightness immediately fluttered in brocade sleeves. For more details, children, you should learn from the Oguri Hangan stories and the "Potted Tree" Noh play that you know.

Sometimes first noble, then base - this is like drawing a fortune that says "末吉" (future fortune), but even blessed people like the Tang emperor of China or Emperor Yomei of our country, if their heart's intention is wrongly placed, immediately become poor people. The end of this floating world is all like Komachi. Do you understand this?

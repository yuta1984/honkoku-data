"Parents are like heaven and earth" (父母如天地)
"Teachers and lords are like the sun and moon" (師君如日月)  
"Be filial to parents morning and evening" (父母孝朝夕)
"Serve teachers and lords day and night" (師君仕昼夜)

Those who give birth to me are my parents; those who nurture me are heaven and earth. Filial people are beloved by Heaven, while unfilial ones are despised.

The Oba bird returns emptily, remaining in mother's fist and buried in earth, borrowing from the mulberry leaves that vigorously tend, emerging from the earth. When King Shun was pressed by the sun, Heaven sent down rain; when a daughter-in-law reviles her mother-in-law, thunder strikes her. This is the difference between being beloved and being hated by Heaven.

The great debt to father and mother is higher than Mount Fuji and deeper than Lake Biwa. A lord's benevolence is equally warm like the sun's rays, allowing peaceful living. A teacher's kindness is like the moon, illuminating darkness and providing clear guidance.

Before teachers, fathers, and mothers, put your hands together respectfully when speaking. Do not forget the blessing of sun and moon, and do not be covered by clouds of delusion. Daily there is the filial piety of crows feeding their parents, and in the moon there are the great deeds of rabbits. When the mouse of time cries out as mediator, the turtle of ten thousand generations remains on high.

Better than a spoiled, snotty child is one who thinks of the compassion of dumplings. How well this makes sense, everyone!

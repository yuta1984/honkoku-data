"Those who love evil invite disaster, like an echo responding to sound, just as a shadow follows the body."

Sadakuro, with his ill-gotten purse from the island, if he loves evil, immediately invites the disaster of being wounded like a wild boar. It's like Kanpei's gun resonating in response to the sound. Pay attention to the place where the heavenly way (divine providence) watches over. Never, never do evil things thinking that people don't see you.

Even Daiba's evil is overwhelmed by Kannon's wisdom; King Zhou of Yin was destroyed by King Wen; Minister Mononobe was defeated by Prince Shotoku; Kiyomori was destroyed by Yoritomo. Even the fox that bewitches people is caught by the mouse's fried tofu, and that mouse in turn perishes to cats, lice are caught by pot-makers and suffer in the smoke of the kappa priest. The enemy role with blue face paint - if he schemes evil, then comes the rough business of red line makeup, waiting in the background to deliver the final crushing blow. The opposition of heaven and earth is one great theatrical performance. How do you understand this?

♪"That fellow who just showed us the doe with two shots - if we shoot him for botan soup, it would be quite warming. Delicious indeed! If father heard this, he'd say it's not Yoichibei but good wisdom. Even Okaru would be happy to hear it." - Kanpei

Do not forget agriculture
Never abandon learning

Like Lord Kinomaru, in autumn fields one wrings dew from sleeves of robes, and climbing to high houses, one sees smoke rising from busy hearths in the rice fields. This too is the result of benevolent governance, is it not? You, like the spindle (odamaki), work with hemp threads thoughtfully through the nights, and in the pathos of songs, feelings and pleasures should be contained. Looking at the various labors of the people and the hats of rice-planting maidens, one realizes what cannot be achieved. When mustard seeds ripen, finding joy in the humble sounds of children in secluded dwellings of this world, and thinking of the songs of village sparrows that naturally make noise, at the time of rice pounding, imbuing mortars with yin-yang principles, mixing the five elements with plows and hoes, lamenting the grass of petty people in the pot, and raising children to become gentlemen of virtue.

People who follow the fifty-year path of sweat and narrow roads, do not err and lose your way. Also, in your leisure time, understand the way of diligent practice.

Ni Kuan never left books from his waist while farming, and ■Kan read books aloud while weaving.

Eating only rice in abundance while being lazy is a great mistake. Even in a single grain of rice lies the heart of countless predecessors, and to consume it wastefully is an extremely grave sin. Children raised in palace service should be taught about the hardships of agriculture. At the end of this book, I have drawn pictures to illustrate this.

【Farmers】
"This year has been exceptionally abundant, and the rice ears have bloomed"
"My, how quickly the days have grown short"
"Sister, you must be quite tired by now; you should rest a little"

"Gems without polishing have no light (tama migakazareba hikari nashi)"
Reading notes: "Without light, they become stone tiles (hikari nakereba ishikawara to su)"
"People without learning have no wisdom (hito manabazareba chi nashi)"
Reading notes: "Without wisdom, they become foolish people (chi naki wo wa gujin to su)"

Even the finest gems, no matter how excellent, will not shine if not polished. Even if they shine, without someone to see them, they remain buried. Still, if the essence is that of a good gem, someday someone will surely see it. There are vermillion gems stored away in chests, hidden or sold for good prices - but this is not about the gems that merchants speak of. This is a metaphor for learning.

Therefore, whatever it may be, if polished, it will shine according to how much it is polished. Even inferior gems, whatever kind of gem - how well understood this is! Also, when the King Zhao of Chu obtained a gem and showed it to Master Confucius, Confucius said, "This is not a gem, but the seed of duckweed." When something appears to be a gem but is not a gem - this is like someone who reads the Analects but does not understand the Analects.

When going offshore fishing, even if you catch good fish, without putting in the sinker, you'll drop the hook and lose your finger. Because we have eyes, we can appreciate places like Kiyomizu Temple and Yasaka. All are good things to see. Even among gems, a tanuki's testicles serve no purpose even at the eighth hour, while a weasel's testicles, though only one in a lifetime, help avoid danger. However, dead gems deceive people's eyes - the wobbling konjac gems, miso balls, eggs - all these tasteless things are ruined if not polished enough.

To polish means to learn. Dogs do not dislike white fur; people should not dislike learning. Children, if you do not study diligently, even the best amazake in the three kingdoms will have no luster if the pot is not polished. How about that - do you understand?

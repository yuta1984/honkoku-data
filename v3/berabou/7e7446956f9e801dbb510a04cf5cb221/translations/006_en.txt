"Jade that is not polished has no luster (tama migakazareba hikari nashi)"
Ruby annotation: "Without luster, it becomes stone tiles (hikari nakereba ishi kawara to su)"
"People who do not study have no wisdom (hito manabazareba chi nashi)"
Ruby annotation: "Those without wisdom become foolish people (chi naki wo ba gujin to su)"

Even if something is clearly beautiful and precious, it will not shine without polishing. Even if it shines, without people to see it, it remains buried. Still, if the essence is good jade, someday someone will notice it. This is not about the jade that the charcoal burner spoke of - keeping it hidden with writing skills stored away in a brush, or seeking to sell it for a good price. This is a metaphor for learning and scholarship. Therefore, no matter what, if you polish it, it should shine according to how much you polish it. Whether honest jade or any kind of jade, how remarkable to understand this! Also, when the King Zhao of Chu obtained jade and showed it to Master Confucius, Confucius said, "This is not jade, but the fruit of duckweed." Something that appears to be jade but is not jade...

This is like "one who reads the Analects but doesn't understand the Analects." When going offshore fishing, even with a good fishing rod, you can't catch anything without bait. Even with a thousand attached, fingers drop things. Because we have eyeballs, we come to places like Kiyomizu Temple. All are good things to see. Even among the same "balls," a raccoon dog's testicles may have their season but no one lives there, while a weasel's testicles are single for life but escape danger. However, dead jewels deceive people's eyes - trembling medicine balls, miso balls, eggs without taste - all are damaged by insufficient polishing.

To polish means to study. A good horse does not dislike white hair; people should not dislike learning. Children, you should study diligently! Even the best amazake in three countries has no luster if the pot is not polished. Don't you understand?

"Gems not polished have no light (tama migakazareba hikari nashi)
Without light, they become stones and tiles (hikari nakuba ishikawara to su)
People who don't study have no wisdom (hito manabazareba chi nashi)
Without wisdom, they become foolish people (chi naki wo ba gujin to su)"

Even gems of the finest quality and brilliance will not shine if not polished. Even if they shine, without someone to see them, they remain buried. Still, if they are truly good gems, someday someone will surely notice them. Zhu Xi stored them in boxes and hid them, or gained favorable times and sighed "alas" - this too was about gems. This is a metaphor for Confucian learning. Therefore, the more you polish them, the more they will shine accordingly.

Even genuine gems, whatever kind they may be, no matter what they're recognized as - when the King Xiang of Chu obtained a gem and showed it to Master Confucius, Confucius said "This is not a gem, but the seed of duckweed." Being a gem yet not being a gem...

This is like those who "read the Analects but don't know the Analects." Even if you go fishing and catch good fish, without putting in gems, you cannot catch anything. Who would drop a finger worth a thousand ryō? Because we have eyeballs, we speak of jumping from the stage of Kiyomizu Temple. In any case, seeing good things is the same.

Even with the same gems, a tanuki's testicles are too hot even at eight o'clock and unbearable, while a weasel's fart-ball happens only once in a lifetime but helps avoid danger. However, inferior gems dazzle people's eyes - the jiggling konjac balls, miso balls, eggs - all these tasteless things become worthless if not polished enough.

To polish means to learn. Wild boars don't mind white hair; people shouldn't mind learning. Children, if you don't study well, even the finest amazake won't shine without polishing the pot. Don't you understand?

"Though the Eightfold Path is broad, those of the ten evils cannot proceed upon it."

There is a story that fits this teaching well. Long, long ago, there was a wealthy man of great virtue who has now passed away, and he had two sons. The elder was called Naritaro and the younger was called Tamejiro. The wealthy man, wanting to test the character of his two sons, built a new house with two entrances. One was narrow but led to the reception room by a short path, while the other was wide but led to the reception room by a long path.

When the wealthy man sat in the reception room and called for them, Tamejiro preferred the shorter way and entered through the narrow entrance, while Naritaro did not mind the distance and entered through the wide and comfortable entrance, arriving at the reception room before Tamejiro. Finally, the wealthy man, moved by Naritaro's sincerity, passed on the family headship to him.

Good deeds are distant and difficult to accomplish, yet they are not dangerous. Evil deeds are close and easy to accomplish, yet they are dangerous. Good news does not leave the gate, but evil news travels a thousand ri.

No one knows a child better than the parent. Regarding Naritaro mentioned above, everything said about him is true. If you add the character for "word" (言) to "nari" (成), it becomes "makoto" (誠, sincerity). Though Tamejiro was clever and wise, he was often deceitful toward people. If you add the character for "person" (人) to "tame" (為), it becomes "itsuwari" (偽, falsehood). This originates from what they express - how fearsome this is! One must be cautious.

Though Mount Koya is vast, those of the ten evils cannot go there. How infuriating! Be prudent.

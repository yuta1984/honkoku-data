"Gentlemen love the wise" (君子愛智者)
"Petty people love the fortunate" (小人愛福人)

The "wisdom" spoken of here is not mere animal cunning. It refers to the higher wisdom that comes from learning and studying, so that one is not ignorant of things. Gentlemen and good people love such wise persons, but greedy people tend to fawn upon the wealthy. This is human nature, but we should distinguish well between these attitudes.

Those who are noble and wealthy are like floating clouds to me, as Confucius also said. It is regrettable that among those who love learning, there are none who pursue learning as eagerly as they pursue money. There are countless grievances regarding money. Even a thousand gold pieces for someone's headache - how could it compare to five ounces of patience? Do you understand? Do you understand?

[Sparrows' dialogue]
"Look at that surly old woman's face. She's truly sullen."
"Is it heavy or light? Like soil or like rice?"

[Surly old woman's dialogue]
"Well then, if I get it before there's any confusion, I might as well take my profit too. Oh ho ho ho ho!"

"Though one emerges from a gate of poverty and lowliness" (雖出貧賤門)
"For one who possesses wisdom" (為有智人者)
"It is just like a lotus in the mud" (宛如泥中蓮)

The drippings after a fire, showing greens at a vegetable store, the cracked hands of a wheat-gluten seller enjoying the smoothness in reverse. The bush warbler of a mountain village is always beloved in the capital's spring. Do not despise what is lowly for being lowly. And do not envy what is noble. The rice grains by the hedge, when seen through the pot with practiced eyes, are most naturally flowers and shade. With a heart that remains unstained by the mud like a lotus leaf, what could deceive by calling dew a jewel? Surely the gods dwell in an honest head. Children must above all be honest. Do not forget what grandfather says.

"Even if it's a chrysanthemum that emerged from a prince's garden, if it doesn't neglect its essential work and is well-cultivated, it will eventually become a famous large-flowered chrysanthemum and leave its name for posterity."

"In spiritual practice, what kind of discrimination is this? When there's no immediate worry, only the body truly knows. How painful!"

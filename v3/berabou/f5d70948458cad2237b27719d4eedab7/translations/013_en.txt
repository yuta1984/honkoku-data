"Listen, Manuemon! You tried to make your naturally-born son Mankichi's nose tall, but raised him poorly, thus ruining your son and making him into a useless person. Your son bears no fault at all. This is entirely due to the parent's poor way of raising him. You should be cautious."

Because his grief was so deep,

he returned his son (to his original form).

"I am most grateful."

Thus Mankichi abandoned his arrogance and became a true person, and his household prospered with wealth.

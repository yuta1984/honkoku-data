The great tengu of Mount Oyama abducted Mankichi and said, "Your arrogance has exceeded all bounds. First, let us see your boasted sumo wrestling skills." He made him wrestle with a bean-tengu (small tengu) who was five years old among the children of the tree-leaf tengus. Mankichi was easily thrown, and when his nose struck the ground, it became somewhat lower.

【Bean-tengu's dialogue】
"Finally!"

【Mankichi's dialogue】
"Oh my, this won't do. What has happened to my nose? There must surely be a tree root somewhere around here. My nose tip hurts terribly."

【Great tengu's dialogue】
"Well done, little one."

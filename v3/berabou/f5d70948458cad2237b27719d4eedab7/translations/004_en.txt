As Mankichi gradually grew up, he became more and more arrogant, thinking "There could be no child more clever, skillful, and beautiful than myself." Strangely, as his arrogant heart grew stronger, his nose became a little higher. Manemon was delighted that his parenting strategy had not failed and raised him to be even more arrogant.

【Father Manemon's dialogue】
"Excellent, excellent! The nose has such luster now... (saying this) let's go out"

"How delightful! His nose has grown quite tall again"

【Izumigawa's dialogue】
"I cannot match the young master, this is terrible"

When Mankichi turned five years old, sumo wrestlers named Shakagatake, Dai...gaseki, Izumigawa and others came to visit. When Mankichi wrestled with them and won, he thought "There could be no strength in Japan greater than mine." At this time, his nose became much higher again.

【Shakagatake's dialogue】
"How truly regrettable. The frustration pierces to my very bones, I'm about to burst with anger"

【Tatsugaseki's dialogue】
"What a fellow to be beaten by"

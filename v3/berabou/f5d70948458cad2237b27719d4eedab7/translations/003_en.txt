Long ago, before the Kamakura period, there was a martial artist named Banya Manemon in Ueno. Having become a respectable man, one spring he was blessed with a son as beautiful as a jewel, whom he named Mankichi and raised with great care. This child was exceptionally beautiful by nature, but had one flaw: his nose was so low it looked like a single go stone had been placed on his face. The couple was particularly troubled by this and made offerings to Oyama Fudo, Sekison Daigongen, the great tengu, and small tengu, praying that his nose would become higher.

【Dialogue of Manemon and his wife】
"Please let Mankichi's nose grow tall so he may become distinguished"

Devising various schemes, they thought, "People's noses grow tall when they become arrogant, so let us raise this child to be as arrogant as possible. Surely there is no child as wonderful as ours in our household," and instructed his wife, chief clerk, and shop assistants to raise him in this manner.

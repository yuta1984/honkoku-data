At this time, Mankichi had become so arrogant that he thought even Hikaru Genji or Ariwara no Narihira could not match his charm and good looks, so his nose had grown abnormally high. Then,

From out of nowhere, a tengu came and took him away into the clouds.

Since Mankichi's whereabouts became unknown, Manemon (his father) was greatly distressed and called upon regular priests and onmyoji diviners to perform divination.

【Priest's dialogue】
"This appears to be because his daily arrogance has gone too far, so a tengu has lured him out and taken him away. However, it appears on the surface of his head that he will return within thirty days."

【Father Manemon's dialogue】
"Having raised him to be so arrogant has now become a great calamity. Please perform prayers so that he may return quickly."

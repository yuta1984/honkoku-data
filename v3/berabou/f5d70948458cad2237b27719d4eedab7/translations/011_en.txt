Although Mankichi's nose had become considerably lower, a little arrogant spirit could still be seen in him. So the small tengus came forward and questioned him about Shinto, Confucianism, and Buddhism at his mouth area. However, he gave no clear answers to any of the questions, saying only foolish things and becoming greatly stuck. So the great tengu stroked the tip of his nose with a fan, and this time his nose became extremely low.

【Great tengu's dialogue】
"When you despise people as you do, you will be despised by people. People inevitably first despise themselves, and then others come to despise them. Do you know this principle?"

【Mankichi's dialogue】
"That's about the true nature of mizuage. Even though I lost in discussions about gods, lords, and Buddha, I thought regretfully that no one could match our spirit for teasing. Crying, I still arrogantly propose that we sit together and compete in buying courtesans."

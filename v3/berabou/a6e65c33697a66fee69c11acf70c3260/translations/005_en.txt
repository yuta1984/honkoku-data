can be heard, and even the personal Buddha hall of the princess
built by that court noble comes to mind,
evoking pathos. While people may say this is like
dealing in old goods at the morning market, simply
because of this, following in the footsteps of Chōshōshi's selected insect
poetry contest, as I compose playful songs of love's heart,
somehow the night has also
grown late. Though there is no usual master of rivers, mountains, wind and moon,
nor any landlord demanding ground rent,
speaking of guests on grass mats, the singing insects

are indeed the masters. Facing toward
the dewy direction, I bow deeply
with sincere heart and stand. This must be one of the three hundred sixty,
an honor among companions.

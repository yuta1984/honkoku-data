Chinese Maple Tree

Tanhachi-ju (Elaeocarpus sylvestris) [Old character notation: 膽八樹]
[Based on the shape of the fruit, this appears to be Hortoki (Elaeocarpus sylvestris) = Tanhachi-ju, but the leaves of Hortoki are thick and not flexible as depicted in this illustration. Since Hortoki resembles the olive tree, it was mistakenly named "Portuguese tree" → Hortoki due to this confusion]

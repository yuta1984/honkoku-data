Two Illustrations of Chinese Olive (Kanran)

　　Illustration of Initial Growth

　　Illustration of Leaves

[Kanran refers to the olive tree, but in this illustration, the initial cotyledons are divided into three parts. The commonly known olive cotyledons are oblong and do not split. The leaf illustration also appears different from typical olive leaves.]

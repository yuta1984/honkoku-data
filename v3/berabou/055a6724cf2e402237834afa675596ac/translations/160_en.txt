Chinese Euphorbia helioscopia
[Euphorbia helioscopia is a plant in the Euphorbiaceae family, and in Japan it is sometimes used as an alternative name for Nourushi (Japanese spurge), but there is a theory that it originally refers to a member of the Euphorbia genus. However, since this illustration doesn't look like a plant from the Euphorbiaceae family, it might be something completely different]

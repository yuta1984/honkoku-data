"The Tale of Iki Chiyomu" (Iki Chiyon Monogatari)

[Iki Chon Monogatari]
[Column title: Iki Chiyon]
[This was the sixteenth story in the "Berabo" series, and there was a poster in the store advertising it as a new publication from Koshodo (Tsutaya) in An'ei 9. While this book itself does not bear Tsutaya's shop crest, this book appears at the end of "Mitate Horai." At the beginning of the second volume, there is a "Ki" (joy) crest in a diamond shape.]

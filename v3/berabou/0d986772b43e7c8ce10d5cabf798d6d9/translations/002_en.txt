Here there is a person called
Chiyonsuke of "Iki."
While thinking about
future
matters
and dozing drowsily,
from a painting of a holy king (seiō)
in court robes, [a figure] emerges and
speaks wordlessly to him.
"Zenzai, zenzai! I am
one who is treasured as
a tutelary spirit of your
house, but until now have been of no use whatsoever.
As a small token, for the fulfillment
of your sincere願
I bestow this peach upon you.
Taste it and
preserve your
lifespan
to observe
the state of the world."
From heaven [the peach descends]

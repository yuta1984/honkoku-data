Rihei named his newborn child Ritaro and raised him. Since a good soul watched over and protected him day by day, the child was naturally obedient and well-mannered, with good behavior. Moreover, he was intelligent and different from other children. Therefore, his parents cherished and raised him like a precious jewel for life. As the saying goes, "the soul of a three-year-old lasts until one hundred," he appeared very promising.

Humans possess something called a soul. What is this soul like?
A man's soul would be a sword. Also, if you listen to Shunkan's argument in the joruri "Himekomatsu," a woman's soul is epitomized by a mirror. And the soul of theater is something that applies red hair to vermillion - such arguments should all be set aside.
Saying it is a sword or mirror are all metaphors.

Also, looking at the margins of chronicles, there is a poem for understanding the soul:
"Nine parts wood, three parts fire on the mountain, one part earth, seven parts metal and five parts water"
- but this is mere forced interpretation.
There is nothing but one thing.
When alive, this is called vital energy (seiki), and when dead, it is called soul and spirit (konpaku).
It is also called the heart-spirit (shinshin), and nothing is more precious to humans than this.

Where does this soul come from? It is bestowed from heaven.

In heaven above, there is a noble deity called the Heavenly Emperor, who constantly takes something like the skin of mukti berries in a tea bowl-like vessel, dissolves it in water, dips a bamboo tube into it, and blows out souls. This method is like children playing with soap bubbles.
When blown out, they are all perfectly round and complete souls, but blown by the winds of delusion and false thoughts, some become distorted, while others become triangular or square as they fly away.

[God's dialogue]
"Artists would probably have trouble drawing my form. Today's appearance is limited to Japan. I am the Heavenly Emperor. I don't know about other countries."

Ritaro was lured by evil souls and came to Yoshiwara. He had intended to return after just conducting business, but after seeing the courtesans, his heart was increasingly captured by evil souls. He relied on a certain teahouse and paid for the services of a courtesan named "Ayano" from the Miura-ya establishment to enjoy himself.

Then suddenly, his soul forgot to fly back to heaven, and he completely lost his senses.

"The soul flies into the air and drops its decoy"

【Dialogue of the evil souls】
"Good, good!"
"Oh my, oh my!"
"Ah, what a lovely fragrance! It's the scent from Okamoto's maiden"

【Ritaro's dialogue】
"Ah, how interesting, how interesting! What a shame that I didn't know about such interesting things until now"

【A woman holding a shamisen sings】
"There's no evening when I tire of sake, that's the madness of one in love"

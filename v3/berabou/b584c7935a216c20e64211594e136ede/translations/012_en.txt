That day, Ritaro woke from his doze and resolved to make a pilgrimage to Asakusa Kannon. As he was about to visit Kannon and return home, he thought to himself:
"Until now, I have never even turned to look at the place called Yoshiwara, but since business is not particularly urgent, it wouldn't hurt to see it once." With this vague thought, he headed toward Dote-Hacho. This was because the evil soul's wicked thoughts had entered him.

"No, no, I thought I would go, but they'll worry at home. But still, since I've come this far, shall I take a quick look? Or should I go back?" Wavering with various thoughts, he went back and forth on the embankment. This was the work of the evil soul.

【The evil soul tempts Ritaro, saying】
"Come now, don't say such indecisive things. We are naturally born ready for this. Let's see the stylish places of Yoshiwara a bit. Come, come, hurry up, come on, come on."

【The soul says (since souls are stark naked)】
"I look like someone who was attacked by bandits"

"Heh heh heh, got him, got him! Heh heh heh, there we go, there we go! My body is like pulling a human cart (since it's dragging Ritaro down the path of evil)"

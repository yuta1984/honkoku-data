Now Ritaro had reached the age of sixteen, so he was given his coming-of-age ceremony (genpuku). Being naturally gifted, he became a handsome young man. When he was entrusted with managing the shop's business, being such an intelligent person, he would wake up early in the morning and go to bed late at night, paying attention to cooking and all household matters. Making frugality his foundation, he devoted himself to filial piety toward his parents and showed compassion to his servants. Always keeping his abacus at hand and protecting both the inner and outer affairs of the business, he became a renowned son in the neighborhood.

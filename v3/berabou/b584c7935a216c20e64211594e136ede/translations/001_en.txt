[Running title: Shingaku (Heart Learning)]

[Known as the 37th Berabō story, this is a kibyōshi (yellow-cover book) that Kyōden published through a different publisher rather than Tsutaya. The work is presented as being inspired by "Menashi Yōjinshō" (Eyeless Precautionary Notes). It is considered to be the origin of the terms "zendama" (good guy/protagonist) and "akudama" (bad guy/antagonist) still used today. It is said to be based on Sekimon Shingaku (stone gate heart learning).]

The moral teacher gave detailed instruction, and afterward offered a heartfelt apology to Mokzen'ya's parents. The parents were greatly pleased and immediately called off the night attack. From then on, Ritarō came to understand the Way, devoted himself to filial piety toward his parents, practiced frugality compassionately, and became a great gentleman. His household prospered and flourished. Everyone praised this as entirely due to the moral teacher's benevolent virtue.

♪Those two sons of good souls succeeded their parent, made Ritarō's body their long-term dwelling, and continued to protect their mother without neglecting their filial duties. From this point on, the souls multiplied and never again caused trouble.

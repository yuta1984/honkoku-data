The evil spirit finally penetrated deep into Ritarō's flesh and drove out the good spirit's wife and two sons. The three of them joined hands and departed from the body they had inhabited for so many years. This was truly a pitiable sight.

From this point on, Ritarō became a complete libertine, staying continuously in the pleasure quarters for four or five days at a time.

【Narrator】
Since Ritarō stays for such an excessively long time, even the courtesan begins to hint at words as if possessed by divine inspiration.

【Courtesan's dialogue】
"Truly, your father and mother must be terribly worried. I really want to send you home, but what can be done?"

【Text continues】
Ritarō's head clerk comes to fetch him and speaks with pseudo-philosophical reasoning like a mountain hermit.

【Head clerk's dialogue】
"You were never such an indiscrete person before. Perhaps you are under the spell of some heavenly demon?"

【Ritarō's dialogue】
"Hey, don't speak such boorish words. No matter what happens, I refuse to go home."

【Evil spirit's dialogue】
"From now on, this is our world."
"Ah, what a fine feeling."

【Inside Ritarō's body】
The spirit acts as if it owns the place and drives out the good spirit.

【Evil spirit's dialogue】
"Get out quickly, be gone!"

【Good spirit's dialogue】
"You'll learn your lesson soon enough."
"How sorrowful."
"Dear mother."

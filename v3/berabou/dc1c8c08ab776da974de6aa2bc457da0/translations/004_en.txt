In the Yoshiwara, there was a famous brothel called Matsuba-ya Senzo, and in that establishment was a courtesan called Umegae, a woman of unparalleled prosperity and fame. At that time, a client named Senshu was deeply infatuated and visited her constantly, so Umegae did not dislike him either. They became intimate and even discussed their future together.

This Umegae had a kamuro (child attendant) known as Take-no, who was the daughter of the aforementioned Man'emon. Because she had an honest heart and a modest nature, Umegae took pity on her and looked after her with special care.

Now Senshu had urgent business in Takasago Bay in Banshu Province and had to travel there, so he would not be able to see her for some time. Today he comes to bid farewell.

[Senshu]
Even if I told you about it, it would be of no use to you.

[Kamuro Take-no]
Senshu-san's business is the same as my name - it's something about bamboo (take) that I know well.

[Umegae]
What kind of place is Takasago Bay?

[Senshu]
Takasago Bay is like a young woman's face.

[Umegae]
How foolish.

[Senshu]
You know it well. Indeed, it could also be called "Fool's Bay" (bakasago).

[Umegae]
What business takes you there? I'm worried, so please hurry back. Otherwise, I might just...

[Brothel manager]
If this is a farewell visit, you should at least pay the fee.

[Male entertainer]
Umegae-sama, what shall we do then?

[Umegae]
Thank you very much for your consideration.

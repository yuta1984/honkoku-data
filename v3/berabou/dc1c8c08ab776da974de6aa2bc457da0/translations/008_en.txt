That great turtle, released into the ocean as he had wished, was so overjoyed that he sought to repay his debt of gratitude. He came to Umegae in the guise of a customer, saying he wanted to buy out her contract from their first meeting. Since Umegae had made deep promises with Senshu, she tried various ways to deflect him, but he persisted in wanting to buy her out. When she challenged him saying "then let me see your sincere heart," the turtle opened his chest to show her. There was indeed "Umegae" written there, but the characters for "prayer" that should have been below the navel could not be found. Reluctantly, with her heart unsatisfied, she was bought out and taken away.

[Turtle]
Now this should clear up any doubts you had.

[Umegae]
What a strange place to have it carved - how ridiculous.

[Turtle]
Buying you out costs a thousand ryō, but our bond will last ten thousand years.

Now the great turtle, having bought out Umegae, brought her to the riverbank and said: "I am the great turtle who was released by Man'emon for the sake of your prayers. Since my ability to make my home in the great ocean is thanks to you, I have temporarily taken the form of a customer to buy out your contract in order to repay this debt. Now let us go together to the hidden palace in the Dragon Palace where I dwell." He made the small turtles that had been released dive into the water and line up like stones, then easily transported them across the water to the Dragon Palace.

♪ "Having them face upward would make for poor footing - have the little turtles turn their bellies up for you to cross. When crossing the sea, it's not as if you're wearing wooden clogs!"

[Umegae]
This is even more slippery!

Some time ago, at Mannenbashi bridge in Fukagawa, there lived an old man named Man'emon who made his living selling eels. He had one beautiful daughter, but his family was poor and struggling financially, so he sold her to become a kamuro (child attendant) in the Yoshiwara pleasure quarter. However, due to natural parental affection, he worried about her day and night.

Man'emon reflected deeply and thought, "No matter how well-established this business may be, taking the lives of so many fish daily makes me fear the extent of my sins." So he changed his business approach and began buying turtles and eels to release them. He would go to the foot of Eitaibashi bridge and sell them while chanting "Release turtles! Release eels!" in the style of joruri narrative, and this business became extraordinarily popular.

[Man]
The turtle-pons (soft-shell turtles) that aren't released are expensive. These eels aren't suitable for eating.

[Old woman]
Today is Buddha's day, so let's release one.

[Man'emon]
How about a turtle?

[Child]
Grandma, let's take it home.

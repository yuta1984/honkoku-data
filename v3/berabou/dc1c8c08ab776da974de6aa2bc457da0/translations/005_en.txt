The kamuro Takeno was grateful in her childish heart for Umegae's affection, and told her father Man'emon to go and express their thanks. Touched by his daughter's thoughtfulness, Man'emon hurried over without delay, bringing sweets and such to thank Umegae, whereupon Umegae gave Man'emon three ryo in gold.

[Courtesan]
So that's Takeno's father?

[Takeno's father, Man'emon]
Thank you for showing such kindness to my smooth-talking daughter who was raised in an eel shop. For both my daughter and Man'emon to receive your favor... These grilled treats are genuine products from the famous shop in front of Seigan Temple, not something for turtles to eat.

[Umegae]
Come closer and talk with me, turtle father. You really are an honest man.
Does the turtle eat grilled treats too? So the turtle won't eat the grilled treats from in front of Seigan Temple? How adorable.

[Man'emon, receiving money from Umegae]
To do such a thing causes me great trouble, but I will accept it with gratitude.

[Umegae, giving money to Man'emon]
Now, now, don't be so formal. My name is Umegae (plum bough), so even giving three hundred ryo wouldn't be enough.

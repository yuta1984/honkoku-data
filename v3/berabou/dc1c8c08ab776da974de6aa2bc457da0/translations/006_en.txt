In the mountains of Bōshū province, there was a large pond called Tanchō pond, where a large turtle had lived for many years. Cranes would often come to this place and speak intimately with the turtle.

I too would like to go out to the sea for a while, but I cannot get out because of the mountain paths. Isn't there some good wisdom for this?

[Crane]
There's a fortunate opportunity coming. A turtle master named Man'emon, who deals in turtles, is coming to buy turtles, so if you get caught and go to Edo, getting to the sea would be no trouble at all. Well, unlike soft-shell turtles, there's no worry about being killed.

Man'emon tried to refuse the three ryō that Umegae had given him in various ways, but since she wouldn't listen, he took it home and immediately went to Bōshū, bought turtles with the three ryō, loaded them on a horse, and returned to Edo.

[Man'emon]
Great turtle lord, please bear with the cramped conditions for a while. Once we get to Edo, I'll provide you with a wonderful home in the great ocean.

Travel is an unfamiliar and painful thing, but even a turtle is prepared for this. If I keep the spirit of staying firm in this wicker basket, I'll manage, but oh, I want to drink a cup of water. With a turtle tongue like a cat's, I simply cannot drink tea.

In the basket on the side, hey, there's a turtle, isn't there? It sounds like "Ai no Tsuchiyama" but the turtle doesn't know. When you say children to the great turtle, do you mean this cargo?

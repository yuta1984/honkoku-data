The great turtle brought Umegae to the Dragon Palace and said: "Since the Eight Great Dragon Kings have no heir and wish to pass the world to me, I am increasingly at ease. Please stay in this place for a long time," and entertained her in various ways.

[Umegae]
You really play very well. What an even better voice you have.

The turtle's entertainment - singing Kameyama-bushi:
"Could such a connection exist even in Japan? Chin-tsun-ten"

Thus Umegae remained in the dragon capital, receiving various hospitalities and unexpectedly spending her days there. But she nostalgically remembered distant Senshu and could not forget him day and night. The court ladies felt sorry for her and tried to console her heart with various feasts.

Now, the feasts of the Dragon Palace were special even by contemporary standards, mostly consisting of vegetarian cuisine. The flesh dishes were river fish, birds, eggs and such. What was commonly served were seaweeds like kelp, sea pine, rough kelp, ogonori, and hijiki. The vegetables from our world - greens, daikon radish, carrots, burdock root stews, and river snails served in pots - were firmly rejected.

When Senshu pulled up his fishing rod, he found an unexpected letter from Umegae. He immediately opened it and read the entire contents, clapping his hands in joy. All his previous doubts were cleared away, and feeling even more longing for her, he wrote in reply that she should quickly request leave and return to him so they could become husband and wife. He attached this message to the tip of the hook and lowered it down.

Umegae told the Dragon King Turtle everything exactly as it happened and requested leave. The turtle placed Umegae on its back to send her back.

[Senshu, reading Umegae's letter]
What's this, turtle? I was in the depths of sunken love. This fellow... eh!

[Boatman]
Master, is that a reply to a love letter from Fukagawa?

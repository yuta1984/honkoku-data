Now, Man'emon bought turtles worth three ryō, mixed in some eels where there was a shortage, wrote "Umegae prayer" on the turtles' bellies, and released them from atop the great bridge. He had intended to write "Umegae prayer" on the eels' bellies as well, but this proved more difficult than shaving a mischievous child's head while they were awake - it was such a challenging feat that it was quite beyond his abilities. In the end, he would have had to slice them like preparing kabayaki, removing head and bones entirely before he could write on them, but that would hardly serve as a prayer offering, so he released them as they were.

[Spectator]
My, what a tremendous number he's releasing!

The large crowd of spectators sang and said:
There are countless turtles and eels. When releasing turtles from various provinces, both novice and masterless ones flee. Later, the turtles swim toward their destination with "this is the law of arising and passing away." The sake-loving eels flee in groups of two or three, feeling particularly carefree. There's no one who wants to eat them anymore; even we have had a change of heart about the afterlife and have decided to give up fishing in the neighborhood.

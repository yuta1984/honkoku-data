for this reason. However, this fart-master, using his buttocks that had never been employed before, let forth melodious farts that even the ancients never released, and made his name known throughout the realm. Just as Chen Ping said, "If I were made to govern the world, it would again be like this meat," I too think that if there were a wise person who applied ingenuity like this fart and saved the people of the world, his achievements would be great. If one applies one's heart and practices diligently, even farts can be like this. Ah, you who aspire to save the world, or

you who study the various arts - if you devote yourself wholeheartedly, your fame throughout the realm will be even greater than that of farts. I borrow the sound of his farts to awaken those who are self-destructive, immature, and lacking in diligence from their slumber. Though saying this is also pedantic, if you say that what this fellow argues is like a fart, then say it. I too do not think of it as merely a fart.

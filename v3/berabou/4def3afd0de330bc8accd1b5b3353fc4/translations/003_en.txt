[Handwritten in ink] Anei 4 (1775)

[Main text]
Preface
As the text says, the floating world is like a dream. How much joy can one truly obtain? This is indeed true. The lifelong glory of Master Kinkin and the dream on the pillow of Kantan are both like a single grain of millet being cooked - fleeting moments. We do not know who Master Kinkin truly is, but I think it is like the transmission of the three birds in the Kokin Wakashū. Those with money become Master Kinkin, while those without money become fools by evening. If this is so, then Master Kinkin is one name yet not one name. As stated in the Theory of Immortals, those who obtain this stand in front, and those who lose this stand behind. Is this what is being said? And so forth. Artist: Koikawa Harumachi, comic writer

After Kinbei inherited the family business, having no want for anything, he gradually indulged in luxury, making entertainment and drinking parties his only pursuits. In complete contrast to his former appearance, he now wore his hair in a middle-shaved style, shaved around the temples, and had his hair done up in the Honda style.

He wore a mouse-tail obi cord, dressed entirely in black habutae silk, with striped obi and Hakata weave, fūtsū patterns and designs when going out. Exhausting all the contemporary fashions, birds of a feather flocked together, and clerk Genshirō, professional entertainer Man'hachi, and blind musician Guichi conspired together, urging him on as their ultimate goal.

Since he was formerly from Kanamura and named Kinbei, people took his name and praised him as "Kinkin-sensei" (Mr. Gold-Gold).

Clerk Genshirō gathered geishas to encourage Kinkin-sensei:

"Master, revelry only at home is quite boring. Tomorrow, please go out to the northern provinces, to Mount Ikoma."

"Little knowing that there are good courtesans in Yotsuya, Shinjuku, and Makunouchi, going north, north, without Kitasa, to Konpira shrine - the place where storms and thunder emerge - surely it was mentioned that one frequents there."

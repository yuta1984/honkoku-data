Long ago, in a certain countryside, there lived a man called Kinmuraya Kinbei. Born with an elegant heart, he wished to fully enjoy the pleasures of the floating world, but being extremely poor, he could not do as his heart desired. Therefore, after much contemplation, he decided to go out to the bustling capital to work as a servant and earn money, so that he could make his way in the world and indulge in the pleasures of the floating world to his heart's content. First, he set his sights on Edo, but since the famous Meguro Fudo-son is a god of fortune, he decided to make a pilgrimage there to pray for his luck. However, as the day had already turned to evening and he had become quite hungry, he stopped to eat the famous awa-mochi (millet rice cakes).

【Kinmuraya Kinbei's (Master Kinkin's) dialogue】
"I've heard that if I go to Edo, everything will work out well. I won't settle for small gains - I'll go big and indulge in luxury to the fullest."

"Excuse me, what time is it now? Could you lend me just a sen or so?"

Now, Meguro Fudo-son is known for its miraculous efficacy and is widely known among merchants. The principal image was created by the Great Master Jikaku, and the temple is called Ryusen-ji. The local specialties here include awa-mochi and something called mochi-bana (rice cake flowers). They split bamboo and tie it like a keman (Buddhist decorative garland), attaching red, white, and yellow rice cakes to it like flowers. Hence it is called mochi-bana.

【Rice cake shop owner's dialogue】
"Yes, welcome! Please come inside to the back."

As Kinbei rode in the palanquin, he soon arrived at the gate of the Izumiya residence. With relief, he alighted from the palanquin, and the managers and clerks led the way, guiding him inside. The magnificence of the residence was truly like jade steps and crystal door hangings. The folding screens and sliding doors were decorated with scattered gold and silver powder, the standing screens bore painted golden sun discs, and the Chinese paper featured silver moon discs. Before long,

The elderly master Seizo came out, his face beaming with joy, and immediately said to Kinbei, "I shall give you my name, have you take the name Izumiya Seizo, bequeath to you all seven treasures and ten thousand precious things, bring out sake worthy of heaven's blessing, and begin a celebratory banquet for master and heir, parent and child."

"This new young master is truly magnificent, like a thunder god!"

"Excellent ability, family virtue well established - how could we not be blessed and grateful!"

"What a mysterious connection this is. From now on, we shall greatly conduct ourselves in new ways."

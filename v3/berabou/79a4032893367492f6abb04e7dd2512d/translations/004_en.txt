can be known because there is absolutely no doubt in the power of pigments.
Therefore, even if one were to travel on foot through the four ri in all directions around Edo, stirring up dust with a feather broom,
without leaving footprints in every corner like the ink of a burnt brush,

has been depicted in exquisite detail down to the very tips of eyelashes,
and what has built its nest in the encircling tomoe roof tiles
　　　　　　is truly worthy of the title "Edo Suzume" (Edo Sparrows).

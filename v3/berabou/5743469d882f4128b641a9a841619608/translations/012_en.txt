The Rat Day festivities had poor timing, so they lowered their banners, but this time's deer hunting and insect hunting was planned with the good sense that it would surely succeed. They took deer to Doukan-yama to make them cry - this was the scheme. Thinking that if there were too few insects it wouldn't be interesting, they prepared quite a few insect cages. In the end, there was no profit to be made, and the banners were pitiful.

"I heard there are only about three of them. This one looks like it might perform, but it won't sing at all. What a troublesome thing."

♪Even though I tell you to keep crying, you beast, you make people fuss over you. Won't you sing even with this?

Setting it up and beating time to make it sing.

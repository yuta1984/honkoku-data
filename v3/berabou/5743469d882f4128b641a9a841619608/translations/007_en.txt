This time, determined to make a hit, he had the main street of the middle district dug to a depth of three shaku, lined it with cement channels, filled it with about one shaku and five sun of compacted sand, added five to six sun of water, and buried clams, short-neck clams and such in the sand. Though it was a bit late, with March 10th being the [?] day, his scheme was to have the courtesans pick up shellfish. However, the courtesans said "This is ridiculous!" and none of them would enter the water. This too was a complete disaster, and the terrible reputation was quite justified.

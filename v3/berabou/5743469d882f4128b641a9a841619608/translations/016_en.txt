They also devised something called "oshi-kake haikai" (pushy haikai), saying "We shall serve as your partners for haikai poetry," and formed groups of two or three people, walking around and starting haikai sessions in crowded places. They would hang a sign at the gate for one toki (about two hours), so by evening the judge would walk around calling "Immediate scoring! Immediate scoring!" When they saw a place with a sign hung, they would request entry and go inside to provide scoring. Even on evenings when rice-pounders came, or when bran-buyers came by. They brought everything themselves - concluding verse contests, main verse contests, prosodic rules, writing desk and inkstone, even white ink - all at their own expense. For a hundred-verse sequence, the fee was a bit over 400 mon. Though not expensive, the profit was small and it didn't become popular.

"I can hear the master's voice - since it's already the ura (second half) of the nagori (final section), it's direct."

"While making them wait a bit strictly, the fair copy can also be completed easily."

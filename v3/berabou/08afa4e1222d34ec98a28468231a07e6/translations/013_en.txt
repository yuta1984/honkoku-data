[Dialogue]
It's discarded stuff
That's right, just
wait a moment

[Main text]
The new guard doesn't patrol daily in spring either, only making fire prevention rounds on windy days every five days. However, in this world where people don't even pick up things discarded on the road, there are occasionally discarded gold and silver items.

When they find something suspicious, they follow the trail and send them off with wooden clappers at each gate.

[Dialogue of the man carrying a chest of gold]
This money is troublesome, just throw it away, heh
　what a thing

The gold is light and easy to carry without much weight

[From here, the lower volume]
Since rain comes every ten days as scheduled, tonight too there's trouble finding a good excuse. The expensive umbrella shops are doing a bit poorly in business.

[Dialogue of the man taking shelter from rain]
Today's rainfall was predictable. Since the door won't open instead, the door can't be set up, I apologize.

[Woman's dialogue]
It's fine even if it rains in. Ah, the tatami mats have gotten all wet. I have tons of money. There's nothing to worry about.

The toilet door won't open. What a predicament.

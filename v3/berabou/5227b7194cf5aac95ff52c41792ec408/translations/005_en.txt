During the reign of the 61st Emperor Suzaku, in the Tenkyō era, Taira no Masakado raised a rebellion in the eastern provinces, and the people lamented this. When this matter was heard in Kyoto, Fujiwara no Hidesato received an imperial edict and rushed forth as part of the punitive force.

"Please strike down Masakado!"

"I heard you are Tawara Tōta, but how is Yoshino of the Tawara-ya? Is she still doing well?"

"This is Hidetada. Recently, messengers have come repeatedly from the Imperial Palace, but that was careless. Well, this must be all connected. Is it Matsuba-ya, Chōji-ya, Tama-ya, or Ōgi-ya? Or rather, if I think hard about it, could it be the flower shop in Nakamachi? Did my fellow send any message?"

"Well, I understand. When His Majesty speaks of such matters, I wonder how one should respond."

"I am called Hidesato, but I'm not a man of the village."

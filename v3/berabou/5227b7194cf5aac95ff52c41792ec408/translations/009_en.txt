When Masakado performed his theatrical piece by stroking his beard, Hidesato countered by showing off his eight-person entertainment act that he had learned and practiced beforehand.

【Masakado's dialogue】
Indeed, what a skillful fellow! I've lost to another capable person again. What a petty result. Just you wait and see.

【From here begins the second volume】
At that moment, Masakado, determined not to lose in rapid calligraphy, wrote seven sets of "iroha" (Japanese syllabary) all at once.

Hidesato, also unwilling to be defeated, wrote eight characters at once with brushstrokes as swift as falling snow. Moreover, he demonstrated playing multiple gongs simultaneously.

【Masakado's dialogue】
How about that! Have you seen such performances in Nakazugoroku and Uzaemon's acts? Playing the gongs makes one dizzy to watch.

Playing the instruments with wild intensity is excellent.

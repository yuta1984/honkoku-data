When Masakado was struck by the great spear point and weakened, Hidesato immediately approached and cut off his head. Mysteriously, blood gushed up into the sky from the cut, and seven souls flew out.

♪Seven souls fly away together

【Masakado's soul's dialogue】
"Soul from before, wait for me! I don't know how much the monthly salary is!"

【Sound of souls flying out】
Bon bon bon bon...

【Hidesato's dialogue】
"Ah, how strange! Isn't that a tokoroten (gelatin noodle) signboard maker?"

【Continuing text】
Seeing this, Hidesato for the first time conceived of something called hanao (sandal straps).

【Hidesato's dialogue】
"This is a golden ball! It's worth one ryo and three bu. Even if I buy a high-class courtesan, I'll have two bu left over."

【Continuing text】
Hidesato's hidden soldiers saw this and, thinking it was his signal smoke, came rushing over.

【Hidesato's hidden soldiers' dialogue】
"Everyone hurry, hurry! Look, look! His signal smoke is rising. If we don't settle this quickly, signal smoke, signal smoke!"

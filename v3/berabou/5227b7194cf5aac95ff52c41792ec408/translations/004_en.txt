Here there is a creator of illustrated booklets called Kyōden. Every time he is pressed by his beloved publishers for new publications, he wishes he could have two or three bodies. It is said that the legendary Taira no Kiyomori supposedly had seven bodies. He thinks that if seven people worked together, the efficiency would be good, but since seven people would also consume resources, it amounts to the same thing. Therefore, the only thing that goes according to his will in this world is Kyōbashi no Den's草双紙 (illustrated popular fiction) from beyond Nakabashi... In the first place...

"Since good achievements and profits will increase, let me remain silent for now."

Used as a stage prop, the curtain opens with brothers who are poets/madmen.

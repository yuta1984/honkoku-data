Flower arrangement method (ikebana)

This arrangement method is called
"ori-ire-bana" (折り入れ花, folded flower arrangement)

For plants like hinōgi (court fan plant), since the stems are
hard and cut short
when arranged, one should use
supporting bamboo as shown in the diagram

The technique for arranging iris and narcissus
in wide-mouthed vessels is as shown in the diagram
If the stems are short,
supporting bamboo should be used
This is reasonable practice without hindrance

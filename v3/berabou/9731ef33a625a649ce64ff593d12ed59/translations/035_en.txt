The proper method for flower arranging《Marginal note: Recording important points from Sen no Rikyu's school as they are》

First, prepare the tools for flower arranging: gather flowers along with a small knife, scissors, and cloth on a tray, and place them on the right side of the tokonoma (alcove). Carefully determine the proper placement of the flower vessel, fill it about seven-tenths with water, and after finishing the arrangement, use the water pitcher placed on the left side of the tokonoma to add water as usual. Step back about three shaku (approximately 3 feet) from the tokonoma, observe carefully, then carry the water pitcher and flower tray back to the kitchen area. The cloth is for wiping the thin board used for flower arranging. When a guest requests flowers, the host should also bring out these same tools, place them in the tokonoma, and fulfill the request. Scattered cut branches and leaves should be tidily disposed of. The flower tray should be as shown in the diagram.

○Be mindful of flowers with overly strong fragrance
　Especially when there are incense ceremonies
　　△Prohibiting arrangements without proper transmission - Three poems
○One peony bloom, one iris flower
　And also one camellia bloom with one leaf
○One iris bloom with one leaf, narcissus with
　Four leaves and six flowers - know that there are proper techniques
○For yellow pond lily's lion's mouth or sunken flowers
　Rohdea, bamboo, and pine-bamboo require even more care (Top secret)
　　△Miscellaneous - Nineteen poems
○What is called ikebana suits parlors and study rooms
　Nageire (casual arrangements) suits tea rooms and small chambers
○For plum, hollyhock, peony, etc., burn the base
　For plum, apply mud on top of that
○For lotus, first wrap thread around the cut end
　And furthermore seal it with mud
○For flowering crab apple, wrap with young mint leaves
　For arranging wisteria, warm sake is good
○Yellow pond lily wilts easily, so split the cut end
　And insert Japanese pepper before arranging
○For winter bamboo and reed leaves, sugar water
　Sprayed on will prevent wilting afterward
○If you want to bend iris flowers, use thread to hang them
　And submerge in water for one night

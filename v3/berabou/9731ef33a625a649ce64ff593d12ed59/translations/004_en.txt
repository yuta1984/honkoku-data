Selecting from various books on this Way (of flower arrangement) to serve as a guide for beginners, I have compiled seventy-six poems written in thirty-one syllables (waka). I have carved these into woodblocks not only for my own viewing but to share with others, and taking the author's surname, I have titled it "Tegoto no Shimizu" (The Clear Spring of Each Style), combining it with over one hundred illustrations of flower arrangements to create one volume as a guide for novices.

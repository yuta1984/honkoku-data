The chief priest (Daigūji), having lost Oshio on whom he had set his heart, and furthermore having had his treasured mandarin ducks that he had entrusted to them escape, becomes extraordinarily enraged and orders Buntā and his wife to be bound with brushwood for execution.

【Daigūji's retainer】
What an utterly infuriating old man! Which way did he let his daughter escape?

【Buntā】
This was something I was prepared for from the beginning. Do with me as you will.

【Old woman Nejigane】
All my efforts were wasted. Even I am furious.

The inherently honest couple Buntā and his wife, even though they are to be punished for their daughter's sake, show no fear whatsoever as they are wrapped in reed mats to be drowned in the sea. The men handle them roughly.

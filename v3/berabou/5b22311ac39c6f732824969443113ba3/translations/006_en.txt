【Bunta's wife】
Merchant, you've arrived earlier than usual this time. Please rest after your journey. What a kind-hearted person you are.

【Oshio】
What an interesting story.

【Bunta】
Well then, Sukehachi-san, please tell us the story behind the mandarin ducks. We don't know about it.

【Sukehachi】
The mandarin ducks - in China there was a man named Kanpaku, and when he and his wife were killed by the emperor, their souls became two birds called mandarin ducks. They are birds that deeply long for their mates.

The head priest loved keeping birds and especially treasured mandarin ducks, which he entrusted to Bunta's care. Around that time, a merchant named Sukehachi from the capital always used Bunta's place as his lodging. Since Oshio loved poetry, she became attached to Sukehachi, and although her parents gradually realized their daughter's feelings, they pretended not to notice because Sukehachi's character was not base or vulgar.

Buntā and his wife had escaped the calamity of being bundled in brushwood and were standing there dazed, when the two samurai from the magistrate's office spoke to them, saying: "We are a pair of mandarin ducks. We were unexpectedly captured by the high priest, and for many years we yearned for each other while confined in a cage. Through your daughter's compassion our lives were saved, and as repayment for that kindness, we have now come to rescue you people as well." No sooner had they spoken than the samurai transformed into a pair of mandarin ducks, beat their wings, and flew away.

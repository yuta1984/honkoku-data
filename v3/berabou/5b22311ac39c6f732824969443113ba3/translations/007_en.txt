In order to obtain Oshio, the Daiguji asked Bunta and his wife to have old woman Nejikane persuade her with various temptations, but since Oshio had no interest in anyone else, she would not consent. Nejikane brought out various items like kosode robes, combs, and hairpins, telling her to be convinced.

【Old woman Nejikane】
If you become the master's bride, you can wear as many beautiful kosode like these as you want. What do you say? Won't you agree?

【Oshio】
No matter how fine they are, I refuse, I refuse.

Since old woman Nejikane tried various deceptions but Oshio would not consent, she attempts to smoke her to death with pine needles.

【Old woman Nejikane】
Stubborn country girl! I'll smoke you like a tanuki. What a hateful face you have.

【Oshio】
No matter how I am tormented, I will not do what goes against my heart. Never, never.

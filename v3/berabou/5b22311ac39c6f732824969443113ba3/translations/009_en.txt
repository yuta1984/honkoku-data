Oshio writes a letter to inform her husband-to-be (Jōhachi), and the two travel together toward the capital.

【Jōhachi】
Are you not tired? Let us walk another two or three ri.

The couple Buntā and his wife feel relieved upon seeing their daughter's written message.

【Buntā's wife】
So Oshio has departed together with Jōhachi. Well done!

【Buntā, reading Oshio's letter】
"After we have departed, you will surely face great hardships, dear parents."

Poor child...

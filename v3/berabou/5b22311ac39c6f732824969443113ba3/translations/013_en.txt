One autumn, he took human form and descended to Hitachi Province. The one called Sukehachi was in truth Lord Arisu no Chūjō. He had risen to prominence in the world and summoned Buntā and his wife.

【Sukehachi, who is actually Arisu no Chūjō】
I came down to Hitachi in search of poetic places (utamakura), became intimate with your daughter, and have long been bound to her in matrimony. Buntā!

Buntā too was granted many rewards.

【Buntā's wife】
I am most grateful.

【Samurai serving the Middle Captain】
What an honest-seeming couple they are.

【The Story of Salt Seller Bunta】
【From episode 8 of "Berabo" onwards, this is a memorable book for Tsutaju and the courtesan Segawa. When the young boy Jūzō (later known as Tsutaju) quarreled with the young Segawa (Hana-no-i), who was still a kamuro (child attendant), he handed her this book as a peace offering. This book appears repeatedly throughout the drama. There is also a scene where Urokogataya hands over the printing blocks to Tsutaju when the publishing house closes down】

The head priest (Daiguji) of Shimousa heard about Oshio and thought she was indeed a modest and proper person, so he summoned Bunta to tell him he wanted her as his bride. However, his daughter would not consent to this.

【Daiguji】
What, will you accept this proposal?

There was also an old woman named Nejikane-baba, a hereditary retainer of this household, who said to leave this matter to her.

【Daiguji】
If you succeed, there will be a reward.

【Nejikane-baba】
I shall skillfully arrange this matter.

【Salt-drawing man】
Old woman, you're getting too emotionally involved where you shouldn't.

Even with the old lady's cunning, that child will never agree.

The Daiguji of the salt-making beach is the foremost salt producer in Shimousa, living in tremendous luxury with many retainers.

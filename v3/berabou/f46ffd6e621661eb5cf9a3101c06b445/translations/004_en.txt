Crane, turtle, hanging wall, Taro, moon
Plum, willow, crossing bridge, Asakusa, spring
　　Rokujuen's drunken play

At the bay where cranes in plain robes of celebration dance,
Even the waves laugh peacefully on this spring day　　　　Chitosekan

On the long day of the crown's cord of Mount Kurai,
Valley nightingales move to the high peaks　　　　　　Jojutei

This morning, facing the sea of the inkstone at Sumiyoshi,
Let us claim the green peaks of the pines　　　　　　Hanasaki Manmaru

Missing the bride in autumn, and in spring again,
The first dream of eggplants not fed to the baku　　　　Kasumisekimori

At the rocky shore pine where waves surge in the spring wind,
Raising its roots high, calling cranes as friends　　　　Furunakamichi

I cannot mistake white plums for deutzia flowers—
The voice of the nightingale that has grown familiar with the garden　　Karihoanyamaru

With plum and willow, the capital is like a spring brocade picture,
The hazy moon as if printed out　　　　　　　　　　Kiyoshiken

When spring comes, Mount Chausu grows misty with green,
The voice of the nightingale that lifts the spirits　　　　Kinpatei Shokan

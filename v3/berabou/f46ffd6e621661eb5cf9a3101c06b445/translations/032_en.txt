How is it that spring's calendar has come to pass?
The voice of the warbler in a valley where no sunlight reaches　　Masagoan Kanki

When plum blossoms bloom and smile, playing with them,
A warbler perches crossing the standing branches　　Asakusaan Ichihito

More than yesterday, today the willow buds stand out,
The fields brighten, and children's hand-clapping can be heard　　Same author

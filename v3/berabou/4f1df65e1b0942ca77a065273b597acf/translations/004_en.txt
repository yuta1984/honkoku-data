【Benzaiten's dialogue】
Ugh, how infuriating!

【Ebisu's dialogue】
In the manner of elder sister's age, we are completely like autumn wind raising sails, the new sake's new装 from all directions, here especially proud, even more so on the mountain top. Kisshoten-san, how grateful. Since that bottom-brother Daikoku is pulling at your sister Benzaiten with his short stature, you should go straight to big brother.

Ebisu's sandal-bearer, Taisuke

【Taisuke's dialogue】
Master, if it's the new sake's Shinzo-sama from that direction, there's also a connection to being in the red. If it's miso pickles, it's Settsuya's business.

【Kisshoten's dialogue】
Though I'm not as much as elder sister, please be kind to me. Oh, how embarrassing!

【Main text】
Benzaiten, consumed by jealousy, inadvertently had her hair turn into snakes. Finding this terrifying even to herself, she came to Kinzanji Temple and asked Hotei the priest to help her shave her head and become a nun.

【Hotei's dialogue】
That is far too hasty! This humble monk will arrange things properly. First, for two or three days, hide inside this closet so that even the acolytes won't find you. When I go out, I'll put you in my bag and carry you. Keeping a woman in the temple is strictly forbidden.

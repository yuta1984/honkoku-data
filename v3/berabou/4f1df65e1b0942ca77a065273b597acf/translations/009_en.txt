Daikoku has long had feelings for Benten, and seems to harbor deep affection for her, but just then Ebisu arrived, so he couldn't voice his resentment and felt disgusted.

When Daikoku opened the basket and looked inside... he was startled. So it seems Hotei and Benten had made arrangements... originally... walking around. Now, you fat, corrupt monk, I'll give you shame and trouble you somehow.

Since Ebisu also has had relations with Benten from before, when he heard of this matter, the fire in his chest was kindled, but since he was in front of his elder brother, he couldn't speak forcefully and dejectedly went home.

【Woman's dialogue】
What a troublesome thing this is.

【Daikoku's dialogue】
Well, well, in this world where one cannot let down one's guard or be careless, this matter between Benten and the monk Hotei... good gracious, what an unsurprising thing. Regarding this, if we have a little scheme, please take care of this young woman for a while... quietly... a person... woman... even so, it's safe.

【Juroujin's dialogue】
That's quite a thing. I would take care of her, I would, but... don't make it too easy. Even I, a monk, do such things, so nowadays one cannot let one's guard down even with old people. Even I, more than my age, have a taste for the heart.

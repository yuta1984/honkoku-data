Bishamonten and Daikokuten hosted a banquet to invite the fortune deities, but thinking that calling Ebisu would make it cramped among the brothers, they excluded Benzaiten and Ebisu, making it a carefully prepared feast with only the remaining combinations.

Bishamonten asked Daikokuten for a loan of money:
"Indeed, recently I've become extremely seasick. Though the world calls us fortune deities, I'm dressed quite shabbily. Please lend me a thousand ryo in gold."

【Centipede, retainer of Bishamonten, speaks】
"Our master also has quite a lot of money, but it's all Kurama koban, so it's like children's toys and cannot be spent."

Since Daikokuten is a great miser, when asked for money his heart was pierced, and he lined up lies to shamelessly refuse.

【Daikokuten's dialogue】
"This temple, given the times, doesn't have even one package, let alone one box. Even if you say 'there is, there is,' what we don't have is gold. Even if you say 'there isn't, there isn't,' what we do have is only mouse droppings."

【Hotei's dialogue】
"If Daikoku-san is like that, then there's no other good person around."

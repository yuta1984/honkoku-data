Daikokuten greeted Bishamonten saying "I apologize for losing face, let me be of service to you," so Bishamonten said "I no longer have need," but feeling even more sorry, he lent him a box. Bishamonten, thinking it was nothing much, straightened his expression a bit and departed. This made the financial troubles even more pressing, and worried about repayment, Daikokuten fell asleep.

【In Daikokuten's dream, the God of Poverty speaks】
I am the God of Poverty for one's entire life. Though you have the name of a god of fortune, you begrudge spending money and are always being stingy. You've already lost face to Bishamonten's request due to your usual miserliness, but still you don't learn from this and continue to worry and struggle over repayment arrangements. This is the height of foolishness. I know that money should be spent, so I spend it as I please. Though I've become poor this way, my nobility of spirit is beyond what the likes of you can reach. Moreover, with such a petty heart that you're jealous of your brother's romantic affairs, thinking you shouldn't visit courtesans, living your whole life without knowing what pleasure is - there's no point in being born as a god. From today, reform your stingy heart, spend money freely, and become a true god of fortune. Farewell.

Through this dream, Daikokuten first achieved enlightenment, and thereafter completely abandoned his miserliness to become a true god of fortune.

Hotei served as matchmaker, making both Benzaiten and Kisshōten wives of Ebisu.

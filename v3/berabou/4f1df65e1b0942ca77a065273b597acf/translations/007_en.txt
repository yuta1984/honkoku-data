Fukurokuju had fallen into a ditch and was in distress when Hotei finally heard about it. He pulled him out of the ditch, borrowed a returning four-handed palanquin that came by, and put him in it. On the way, they came to a large river, so he carried Fukurokuju across to the other side, then carried Daikoku on his back to cross over as well.

Master, it's dangerous!

【Fukurokuju's dialogue】
What do you mean dangerous? What's dangerous?

【Palanquin bearer's dialogue】
The carrying poles are all warped!

【Daikoku's dialogue】
Are you going to abandon me here? What are you going to do? Hey, that Hotei fellow!

【Hotei's dialogue】
Now I'll put this bag over there first, then carry you across on my back. Really, I've never had such a miserable day as today. I'm doing all this hard work by myself. What an aggravating thing!

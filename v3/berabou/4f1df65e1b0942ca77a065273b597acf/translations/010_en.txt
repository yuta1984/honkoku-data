【Hotei's dialogue】
Hey, Chinese children, take this bag to Menzo just as it is. Never look inside. Now, I'll also hand over this bag here. Please give my regards to Lord Daikoku.

【Character's dialogue】
The bags got mixed up, so I'm returning them. Please hand over this bag to these people.

【Narrator】
Ever since someone jokingly said "Please, Hotei-san, though it may be inadequate, take me as your concubine," they had been calling the temple's hidden woman "Daikoku."

When Daikoku thoroughly bad-mouthed and shamed Hotei for hiding Benten, Hotei spoke in detail about Daikoku's unreasonable infatuation with Benten, and how he had pacified Benten when she was resolved to become a nun. As they exchanged confessions and hurled insults at each other, Daikoku became greatly enraged and dejectedly went home.

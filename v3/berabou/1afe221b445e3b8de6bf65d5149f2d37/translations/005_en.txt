Relating to a fan painting of Iwai Hanshirō

Spreading wide, the New Year's gift of Iwai's fan, folding cranes with layers of half-sheets of paper

《Nakayoshi no Koyoshi》

Bamboo horse
《Kuretake no Fushimi》
With a whip applied to the bamboo of an honest heart, calling "heave-ho!" for the first ride of spring

If the girl makes a big splash with this, she will surely be delighted

If the reading instructor saw this, he would surely scold

Whatever is fine, it's now

Day of the Rat
Yasunori of Asakusa

These days, kyōka poets scheme and have adequate private means or quality - this too is surely academic decline

It's not finished dancing, it's viewing day

Wind headband
Yabusaka no Oshimi
Not wet but roaring in the clouds, the kite - whose restraining hand does the wind headband come from?

It's the good thoughts behind, so the sleeve guards were raised

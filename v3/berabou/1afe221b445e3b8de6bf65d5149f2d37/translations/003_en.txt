Preface

This is not the reign of Emperor Ichijō, nor the time of Minamoto no Raikō who defeated the demon Shuten-dōji on Mount Ōeyama, but rather a tale set in an ordinary eight-tatami room. Today there was to be a kyōka (comic verse) gathering, and people naturally assembled like hand-cracked chestnuts.

Oh, what a misunderstanding! Confusing the character for "rope" (tsuna) used in capturing alive in Tamba with the "net" (ami) used for fishing, I thought this might be Rashōmon gate, but unexpectedly having taken the wrong path, Sakata Kinpira arrived in his usual drunken state, pushing an ox-cart.

From Tenjin-shita, after the usual nap, he would make words bloom like flowers, rowing a wave-riding boat from the Edo River toward the opposite shore. Mixing Raikō's Four Heavenly Kings with the three gods of waka poetry in a tug-of-war rope, he became the leader of the Seven Lucky Gods and the remarkable dice-throwing children's games - a veritable king of street urchins.

Indeed, the first dream I saw was:
First Fuji, second hawk, third eggplant
Don't confuse your dreams
And let the baku devour them

The Financially Strapped Samurai,
Yomo no Akara

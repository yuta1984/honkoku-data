The stump of a great tree and other monsters were scolded by Kinpira and defeated by the same reasoning. Many monsters seemed to vanish suddenly all at once, but left behind two volumes of popular fiction in the void.

A single-line title appeared. The three □ people thought it strange and opened it to look, whereupon the tree stump revealed from the □ a skillfully conceived □ work of fiction □□. "It would be against our intentions to leave this as it is," so immediately we shall use it for this year's new edition, preparing it solely as entertainment for the spring rains.

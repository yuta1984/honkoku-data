The tea kettle somehow wanted to gather like-minded companions to obstruct the large tree's scheme and rescue the artists, kusazoshi publishers, and block-print dealers from their difficulties. However, he had no method or people to rely on. Here there existed what was called "shōhon" (legitimate books), which were the beginning of Edo kusazoshi that had been completed up until around the Kyōhō era. These were commonly called "karakami-hyōshi" (Chinese paper covers). Under these were numerous famous characters such as Chikatuki, Usuyuki, Eboshi-ori, Kinpira, Kabuto-ron, and many other renowned figures. However, nowadays dorayaki and sweet potatoes are popular in the world, and though the shōhon exist, they are as if nonexistent, stored away in warehouses. Since there was no one to rely on, the tea kettle came up with the idea of "one serving for one sen" and came daily to the window of this warehouse [with Urokokataya's seal], sending detailed letters to inform them.

The shōhon characters Usuyuki-hime, Chikatuki, and others saw the tea kettle's letter and worried.
♪ Though I think to inquire, the warehouse door won't open, am I truly a caged bird? How resentful!

Among the shōhon companions, having consulted together, we humbly request a good strategy. Though I'm not Rikiya, the details are in the letter, so goes the message.

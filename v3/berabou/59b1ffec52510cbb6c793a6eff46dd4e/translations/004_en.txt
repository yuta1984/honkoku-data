The large tree stump spoke: "To begin with, I and my subordinates have casually pushed into the kusazoshi (illustrated storybooks), and all people know our names. We are mentioned in Master Negishi's poetry collections and even referenced in theatrical performances, so there is no one who doesn't know us. Therefore, we are the patron gods and founding fathers of kusazoshi revival. Artists and kusazoshi publishers should worship us, yet they haven't even offered us a cup of lukewarm tea. So this spring, we shall take on strange ghostly forms and show ourselves to all people." He spoke with great anger.

♪ The appearance of red sword-bearers from all directions, throats parched behind the mountains, with such connections, I'll cut them down in one breath!

The tea kettle offered remonstrance to the large tree, but good advice fell on deaf ears, the frosty tea mouth was bitter. The large tree, greatly angered, tried to persuade by force, saying, "I could smash you and put you in a tooth-blackening pot, but I'll persuade you with compassion instead."

The confectionery small sword said: "Come now, persuasion, persuasion! For me to recommend persuasion with my head - what novelty this is with confectionery as accompaniment!"

♪ The tea kettle said: "I shouldn't speak as my reputation has declined recently, but O large tree stump, you're merely a firewood-splitting general, yet to appear in kusazoshi is the greatest fortune!

The ceiling hawk said: "That's about you, come out now, sho!"

"To laugh at my master over tea!"
The long-tailed bird of Narazu forest: "Not unwilling" "Well then?"

The tea kettle, having reached the point of persuasion, was driven away from the gate by the calculating crow's apology.

"Don't hit so much, cracks will form. Well, this situation is like the wind from Aoyagi inkstone. Since the persuasion has stopped, I'll now serve for even one puff, one sen."

♪ The wet tea kettle lost at the standing place... [unclear], whether to burn together or not break... tea bowl and tea bowl chi... chi...

When the chandala woman
sang her song,
five hundred
hermit sages
broke their meditation,
and the unicorn sage
lost his supernatural powers
upon seeing
the white of a woman's shins.
Daijirō too, from some time,
began frequenting the pleasure quarters,
deeply infatuated
with a courtesan
named Horeno of Ukiyaya.
On rainy
days he would order
delicacies from Naka-no-chō,
and when snow covered the pleasure boats,
he would go to Tashō
in Mukōjima. For
three hundred sixty days
a year, he spent all his time
immersed in Yoshiwara.

Horeno at first
did not think much of him,
but as they grew intimate,
her feelings deepened,
and through the eyes of love,
it seemed as if in all
the three thousand worlds there was
no other handsome man but Daijirō.

♪My lord, each time
you visit, you become
more and more of a fine man,
ever more sophisticated

♪Get up! Today you still
haven't bathed and your hair
is still unbound

♪I may not look like much, but
I think of myself as quite the ladies' man

♪He doesn't look appealing
to our eyes, but to Horeno-san
he must appear
quite the handsome fellow indeed

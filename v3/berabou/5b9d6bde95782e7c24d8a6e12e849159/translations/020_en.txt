Each person had lost their way according to their own hearts, like being separated from their lantern in Banchō district. With no destination in mind, they wandered round and round through the wheels of the twelve-link chain of causation and the depths of the five and six realms of existence, with no beginning and no end, completely at a loss. Just then, purple clouds suddenly spread across the sky, exotic fragrances wafted through the air, flowers fell from above, music could be heard, and the Great Compassionate Kannon (Avalokiteshvara) appeared, saying:

"Excellent, excellent! I am the one who, in order to save you all, dwelt in the womb of impermanence and was born as Daijirō in this sorrowful world. In truth, I am the Eleven-Faced Kannon. For the sentient beings of the three realms and the ordinary people of the six paths, though the waves of separation from loved ones may be deeper than the wells at high and full tide, for the sake of ignorance and joy, I do not spill even a single drop. Whether dear, cute, desired, precious, joyful, sad, loved, disliked, frightening, or terrifying—all are delusions of the heart. Whether you see others as clever or foolish, as handsome men or ugly men, as King Yama or as Jizō—it is all in your mind. Now I shall explain to you the principles of various schools and guide each of you to the true path."

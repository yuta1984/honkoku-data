Thus have I heard:
Long, long ago, in the vicinity of Asakusa,
there lived a man named Fudarakuya Daijirō.
What his business was, I do not know,
but he was a solid man of property,
a wealthy master whose age
was around twenty-five or twenty-six, like the twenty-fifth chapter of the Fumon-bon.
Though not entirely without merit,
he was hard to accept as a handsome man.
If you thought him clever by nature,
he fell short by about three parts;
if you thought him a fool,
he seemed to possess
about a hundred coins' worth
of sense, making him
an average man among ten.
These days,
driven by some great vow,
day after day
he was copying
the Mahāyāna sutras.

completed his religious practices
at Unrin'in Temple,
there would be complaints
about someone as severe as me

♪Ah, how tedious—
a night without
yawning,
how thoughtless
of me

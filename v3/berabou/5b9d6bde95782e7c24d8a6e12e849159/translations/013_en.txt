Taking advantage of the moment when [someone] is crying,
by the light of the hanging lantern,
looking at a letter that came
from that beloved person, behind him
observing the situation of Oyazaemon—
his white-haired mother,
not being a deity,
also takes a mirror
from the second floor
to look at herself. That
face, no matter how old,
looks like a child's.
Even when she pays attention to her appearance,
thinking it lovely and cute,
from her heart
it appears completely innocent.

"The old man is again a disagreeable fellow, but
since he's keeping an eye on
Daijirō's conduct,
finding it incomprehensible,
the face reflected
in the water basin
appears as a complete fool."

"With children these days
one cannot
let down one's guard.
My son too
is looking at
a letter—
what a
precocious
child."

"So and so, since there are matters that cannot be understood without meeting in person, tonight I absolutely await your visit"—with this, tonight no matter what happens, he cannot help but go.

"Whether viewed from the side
or from the front,
he's a fool.
I cannot help but
disown and confine him."

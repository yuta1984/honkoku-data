Money is not an enemy—
it is obtaining it that is
difficult. As soon as Daijirō
borrowed the money,
he immediately rushed
to a teahouse called
Daifukuya in Naka-no-chō
as if making a pilgrimage.
Since he was always
a reliable paying customer,
in the teahouse's eyes
Daijirō's face
appeared like a god
of good fortune,
so they treated him
with such hospitality
that they practically
swept the garden with silk.

♪Tonight, if things go badly,
shall I try betting on
Tawaraya or Tamaya?

♪When you wear money
around your neck, it makes
your shoulders stiff—
it's the Daikoku of
Nanjū-in!

♪The teahouse's young workers,
though reduced to poverty,
still massage even the shoulders
in their service.
♪You've become so
fortunately plump
that ordinary massage
probably won't
be effective.

【Teahouse Proprietress】
♪Good evening, and moreover
it's a kinoe-ne day.

【Teahouse Master】
♪Sir, that doesn't
sound like
Dentsū-in.

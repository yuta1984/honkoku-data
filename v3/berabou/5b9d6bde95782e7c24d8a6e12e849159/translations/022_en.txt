Postscript
Kyokutei Bakin tills books and weeds paper.
In the tedium of spring with its nursery-field rains, even the irrigation of inkstone water—taking the seeds of fallen ears from his works, with his brush tip serving as plow and hoe, he turns over the emotions of the world to create this booklet. He entrusts and requests that the remaining half-page be cultivated by the same person in the same field.

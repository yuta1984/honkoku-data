Daijirō now awakened to his situation and regretted it, but to no avail. Finding the world tasteless, he abandoned it, left behind a farewell note, and set out to drown himself in the Asakusa River. Since his whereabouts became unknown, even though his parents and mother-in-law were moved with emotion, they wandered lost on the path of parental love. His wife and children wandered lost on the path of longing love, money lenders and teahouse debt collectors wandered lost on the path of greed, servants wandered lost in obligations, monks wandered lost in religious vessels, courtesans wandered lost in carnal desire, and young women wandered lost in hearts of vanity. All together, they followed his traces, searching and searching, wandering about on the path of delusion.

【Daijirō】
〽Emperor Jinmu rides on an island shaped like Akitsushima, but I am on the path of the character for "delusion."

【Mother】
〽Where and how is he? Perhaps he has been bewitched by a fox.

【Son, being led by his mother's hand】
〽Mother, I'm tired.

【Debt collector】
〽I will collect what is owed. I have no use for goods either, but why did I come here?

【Courtesan】
〽My, what a strange path this is.

〽Is that Musashino over there?
〽It looks like the path to Mount Akiba, so cold.

A gentleman does not transfer his anger
nor repeat his mistakes. Daijirō
was rejected by the courtesan, and drowsy with sleepiness,
dozily returned home where his wife too,
being such a character, after one or two harsh words
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　shiga
struck by a fit of anger
　　　　　　　　awakened Danjūrō

〽Speaking harshly toward her husband, here
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta, you fool!
How could someone like you
have any opinion
worth listening to?
Ah, you're useless! 《Side note: Pull｜　》

〽Even so, that's too much
ja-ja-ja-ja-ja, that's too much
indeed, my dear
this person

Even the wife
speaks with the delivery
of an actor
　　　　　　　　good

Their son Daikichi
in his childish mind
sees his father as
looking like Danjūrō
therefore

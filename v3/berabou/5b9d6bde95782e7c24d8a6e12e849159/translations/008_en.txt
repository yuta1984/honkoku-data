That night,
at the pleasure house,
Horeno was causing a commotion,
so he used some borrowed money
to spite her or something,
and bought a courtesan
called "Furuya no
Furimasu."
But this courtesan,
unlike Horeno, had no connection with him
and was of high discernment.
In this courtesan's eyes,
Daijirō appeared as a worthless man
not worth three mon,
so she treated him very poorly.

【Daijirō】
♪You're a high-ranking courtesan,
they say, but you're so cold-hearted—
like a demon or something so cruel
that you stick out your tongue at me.

【Courtesan】
♪Since the man looks bad,
even what he says
is boorish.

♪What did you say?
How ridiculous.

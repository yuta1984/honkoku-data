Growing tired of the cats' conversation, he tried to eavesdrop on the dogs' feelings, and they too were talking about their night watch duties. "Last evening I saw some suspicious character prowling around, so I didn't sleep a wink. Over in the side street they sometimes give me a bowl of rice, so I make my rounds there too. The fish seller treats me well since I bit someone once, so he doesn't treat me poorly. I barked until my voice was hoarse until the crows started calling, and when I was tired and dozily sleeping in the middle of the street, some fool stepped hard on me. When I think about it, there are idiots who blame innocent creatures for things. This is how it is here - since my world is small, I mustn't go against my master's wishes. When the young master says 'give me your paw,' I respond affectionately every time. After all, being loved is profitable." Hearing this, Shinemon was terribly impressed and frightened.

"It would be good if grandmother would shake herself soon. If I say this from a dog's mouth, it's clear that snow is the dog's aunt."

"The Iseya shop's business and the monk are good fellows, but alone it's troublesome."

Shinemon, now understanding the power of that cloak and hat, felt like taking a little trip and set out alone to wander around Enoshima, Kamakura, the Oyama area, and around Hakone. As long as he wore this cloak and hat, he wouldn't need travel permits even at Hakone, but there lies the thing about Daikoku-sama - the national checkpoint is quite strict, and here the character for "hiding" is disliked. Elsewhere, even if he joked around in Shinagawa wearing his hat, got angry at Sangen-jaya, caught live flounder at Hamagawa, stayed at Kanagawa or Fujisawa, as long as he wore the cloak he could become like a parent to delicious food. But here's the thing about Shinemon - he was an honest man who had won Daikoku's favor, and without that, the god would never have lent him such precious items. The god's great mercy came from knowing his character.

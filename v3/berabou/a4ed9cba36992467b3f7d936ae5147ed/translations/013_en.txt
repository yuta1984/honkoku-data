When Shinemon opened his eyes after a while, he found himself at the Dragon Palace. Here too, hidden by his straw raincoat and hat, he could see it was exactly like the Dragon Palace of ancient times. First of all, here there was nothing that would oppose the Eight Great Dragon Kings. The world of birds and beasts mixes and lives with humans, so there are occasional changes. Although the sea is said to be vast, the Dragon King's dominion extends as far as the tide reaches. Therefore, even flounder and sea bream do not stand above others, and grey mullet and sea bass must appear before the king each time they change their names. Now, having heard that in the world above, pufferfish take human lives, the Dragon King summoned one nearby to reform this matter. When asked about this, the pufferfish replied, "This matter is not of our doing, but rather a parasite called 'cho' that attaches to us and harms people," giving a clear explanation. However, ashamed of having brought a bad reputation to the Dragon Palace, when it returned home, it immediately slit its own belly and died. Perhaps for this reason, even now only pufferfish have no intestines. This shows how strict a place it is, demonstrating the righteousness of royal law.

Shinemon, hiding and thinking to himself: "In the time of Lord Tankai, if I had been asked to retrieve jewels with this straw raincoat and hat, it would have gone well. But it probably wouldn't work for stealing."

♪Sea bass and grey mullet and their kind originally serve from the rivers, so as they grow they are granted official names. Also, those who live in the Dragon Palace, from sea bream to flying fish, inherit their parents' names - it's a well-ordered world.

Since ancient times, the ascension of sea bass's father and the current □ brings great honor to the house.

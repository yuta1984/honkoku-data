Also, one house away from Shimaya lived a man called Tokudaya Shinzaemon. He too was a wealthy man in that area, wanting for nothing, and moreover had boundless affection for his only son, who was six years old. As is often the case, when one person alone dotes on a child, the neighbors come to dislike it. The mother felt sorry about this and, feeling she had no face to show before Master Shimaya the retired merchant, gradually tried to reason with her husband. But being as stubborn as he was, he wouldn't listen.

"Leave it be! All children are like this. What's this about that old man's talk? I haven't heard it myself, but they say it's about the way of loyalty and filial piety. Who doesn't know about that? If we bring up His Lordship's decrees, the way of loyalty and filial piety goes without saying - there's no need to speak of it or even listen to it. There's nothing new about such well-known matters. Surely that old man wouldn't speak of such things as if they were novelties either. He probably tells some other interesting stories, which is why people go to listen. The boy will become well-behaved once he starts going to his teacher next year, won't you, my boy?"

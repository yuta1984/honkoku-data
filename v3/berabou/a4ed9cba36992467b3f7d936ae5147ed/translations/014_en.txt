Shinemon had seen the Dragon Palace thoroughly, but being cautious even until mealtime, he departed with the intention of returning even if poisoned. Looking inside this structure, he saw what appeared to be many doctors treating patients, and nine out of ten had injured mouths. These were all those who had been caught by fishing and had swallowed hooks. Long ago, when Hikohohodemi no Mikoto had his fishhook taken by a fish called Umisachihiko, he came to this place to search for it and retrieve it before returning, but now it seems no one knows of this story. If they knew this, not a single fish would be caught.

In any case, it's reasonable that they think they've only been afflicted by something with thorns. Also, whales bitten by crocodiles look like pictures when they apply medicinal plasters. Now, the injuries of small fish occurred like those around the Asakusa River. If so, is river water the hot spring resort of the Dragon Palace? Since whales and such are familiar with hot spring cures, it's reasonable that they heal with medicinal plasters.

♪Whether it's medicinal plaster or acupuncture needles, I don't know - it seems the logic is that it would be better to just apply it by hand.

Flying fish and old shrimp, be careful and stay away. However, my parent became an individual through sweet potato.

I want to apply it to my dysentery too.

As he continued walking, he crossed large rocks and leaped over valleys, but there was no place that looked like a proper road. There was one rock cave with a terrible path where bear grass grew, so he peered inside and found a large, dark cave-like structure resembling a storehouse. Deep inside, two things glittered brightly, and when he looked carefully, they were the eyes of a large bear who was smoking tobacco with an angry expression, which startled him greatly. This place was immediately where one should put on a straw raincoat and hat, but having no choice but to ask about the road, though reluctantly, he spoke fearfully.

"Excuse me, I humbly ask for help. I am someone who has lost his way. How do I get to Odawara?" he said with extreme politeness. The bear replied, "That's quite far, no mistake about it. You've probably walked about twenty ri through the mountains today. You can't return today. Well, come inside. You must be very hungry, but since there's no rice or such, please lick this," and what he offered was covered with ants. "This is my winter store," he said, offering it. When Shinemon tried licking it, it was remarkably more delicious than a two-course feast. The feeling in his stomach was indescribable. Just as people say, ants are bear food - he had heard this before, but this was his first time actually tasting them.

"My place has no other tea sweets, and the sushi isn't particularly interesting either, but tomorrow I'll have someone escort you to the road," the bear said, showing more kindness than country relatives would - truly a precious thing.

A monkey and rabbit go as the bear's messengers to summon a wolf.

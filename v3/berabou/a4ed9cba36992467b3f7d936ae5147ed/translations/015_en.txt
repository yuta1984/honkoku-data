Realizing that he had been playing longer than expected and that Daikoku-sama and the household would probably be worried, he hurried on horseback. When he reached Gonda-zaka, he found fellow horses resting, so he tied his horse there as well for a tobacco break. When a horse that was resting earlier greeted Shinemon's horse with "You're early," Shinemon was also startled and woke from his drowsiness.

In the fellowship of horses, one said: "Yesterday I went far and got tired. From the inn to the riverside I did detective work, then returned to Daima carrying sake barrels for a night attack, then carried passengers to Chiba inn, then to Noda until my head spun, carrying people home until I was completely exhausted." Shinemon's horse replied: "That was good for you. I spilled over in front of the corner sake shop, had drums beaten on me by children, and was played with in various ways. My drunkenness couldn't even happen because the government notices are strict about such things. Moving sluggishly, I barely managed to earn just one Bando coin before returning, and my master with his two horses asked 'What is this state?' with a bad mood.

Of course, if I don't earn at least one coin each, I'll be disowned. If it's even one coin, I think it's acceptable, but then the warehouse gets damaged. I'd rather work separately - though it's hard work for me, I don't mind, but it hurts when I go out to collect transport fees. I try to be careful not to let riders fall, but without knowing this consideration, because I feel comfortable, I doze off and my teeth slip out, being called a blind and lame horse. There's no worse-paying work than this. In the next life, I want to be born as a lord's horse, eat delicious food, watch monkey dances, and enjoy myself." As the horse spoke, Shinemon listened intently, but to others it only sounded like neighing. This too must be a virtue of his spiritual protection.

[Horse]
Your master seems to be sleeping. Neigh to wake him up.

[Tea house]
Master, I'll do it cheaply.

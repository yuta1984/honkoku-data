Following Daikokuten's divine instruction, from when his son was seven years old, he had him read the "Classic of Filial Piety" and the "Great Learning," while he himself studied the learning of commerce alongside. Until now he had thought only of his own benefit, but now he thinks of benefiting others rather than himself.

Until now he thought the world could not be navigated without gold and silver, and focused only on making money, making money, thinking it profitable to worry only about the fire under his own pot. But this is only temporary profit that will ultimately lead to ruin, as Daijingu-sama has warned, and the sages have taught that "when treasures flourish, they flourish and then decline." How excellent this is!

Though Shinemon's son became so learned that he could not even read fans inscribed with Chinese poetry selections, he comprehended how to cultivate himself, and moreover understood even the nature of dogs, cats, hawks, and crows. Thus he was employed by society as successor to the retired master of Shimaya. Since his son not only pursued learning but also followed his example and seemed likely to become a person of high standing, the couple's joy - this too being Daikokuten's divine revelation - welcomed spring even more auspiciously than usual.

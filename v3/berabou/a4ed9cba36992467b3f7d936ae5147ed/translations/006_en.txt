He took the cloak and hat he had received and quietly went up to the second floor to try them on. He couldn't tell whether he had become invisible or not, but when he looked down through the window, he saw three neighborhood cats basking in the sun. Even though he was watching them, they neither fled nor made a fuss.

"So this appearance is invisible even to cats' eyes. This is interesting," he thought, holding his breath as he eavesdropped. One of the cats said:

"Tora, you say you injured the tip of your nose."
Then Tora replied:
"When I stole a piece of bonito, the mistress got incredibly angry, and even though the gods said to put food in my bowl, she wouldn't do it out of annoyance, so I scratched her because I was hungry. Oh, at my house too, yesterday this damn creature was sulking all day—how infuriating. I want to be born as a mouse next time. I could eat my favorite mice and sleep all day. Nothing could be easier. What a great laugh that would be!"

"I don't like mice anymore, but if that guy dies and they say he gnawed the rice container, I can't let that slide. When the household sleeps, I don't get a wink of sleep. I get sleepy during the day and it's troublesome. If the mice were prepared in soy sauce glaze with three sho and three go of seasoning, or pickled in salt brine, I might eat them, but I won't just catch and eat them raw. Truly, humans don't understand anything."

Hearing this conversation, Shinemon became angry and was so astonished by such talk that he was chilled to the bone and did a somersault.

[Cat's dialogue:]
"They say dogs know things well and recognize people, but cats are lively and don't even know what happiness is. But I hate being as frivolous as dogs appear to be."

"My master says this one might even shapeshift, but you're ignoring the fact that you once wore a woman's long-sleeved kimono."

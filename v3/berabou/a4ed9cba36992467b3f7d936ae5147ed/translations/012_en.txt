No matter how kindly they treated him, that night he couldn't sleep a wink, and when dawn broke early, the bear ordered a wolf to escort him to where the road could be found. Shinemon had heard that his escort would be a wolf and accepted this, so being very careful with his footing for his dear life, as they walked along the path chatting, the wolf said, contrary to his fierce appearance, "We don't find anything as frightening as humans. Because humans are scary, we try to threaten them or lie in wait. If they don't bother us first, why should we?" To this Shinemon replied, "Indeed, that would be your nature. Everyone's hospitality since last evening has been extraordinary," speaking with false bravado. Since the wolf knew shortcuts, they reached the main highway in less than half a day, covering yesterday's twenty ri journey.

Even if a bear got lost and came to them, there probably isn't a human in all of Japan who would let it stay even one night. I'm part of that same group - how shameful.

Please rest on one of those rocks over there.

Shinemon, having been helped by the animal world, goes to pay his respects in gratitude. Without any amazement, he also visited Enoshima, and when he reached Shichirigahama, seeing a large clam, he thought deeply: "The bush warbler singing among flowers and the frog living in water composing poetry - this is Japan." Sumiyoshi Myojin challenged Bai Letian, and the sparrow of Kangakuin chirped even fierce songs. Even sparrows twisted square characters, and in that light entered the sea to become clams. That said, if even those measured by the sho measure were sparrows, there would be no rice ears for humans to eat. This large clam, being originally a scholar, was enjoying itself by playing mirage, a Chinese musical piece. Finding this interesting, Shinemon gently mounted the clam, and gradually sank down with it. Shinemon thought that with the virtue of his straw raincoat and hat, he might as well go see the Dragon Palace, so he tightly closed his eyes and mouth and let the clam take him wherever it would. How amusing that he rejoiced in his heart, thinking that Daikoku-sama had indeed lent him something with great power.

In my greed, I'd like to show this mirage-playing through some clever loan arrangement.

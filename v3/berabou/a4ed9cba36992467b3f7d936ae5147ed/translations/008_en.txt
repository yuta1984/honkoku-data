Then, as he headed toward Goten-yama, a flock of birds went chattering by, and thinking this too seemed interesting, he pulled on that cloak and hat and followed after them. Continuing to peer through the deep, dense forest, he came upon a hermitage, and looking at what approached from the other direction, he saw it was doves. Wearing long and short swords and formal dress, the doves here wore hakama trousers, and when they met, their greetings were so proper and polite that even humans should be ashamed. Truly, doves have the courtesy of the three branches - they perch three branches lower than their parents. If even good people behave this way, how much more so toward their parents, and he felt ashamed even before these birds.

Again, peering into that hermitage, he saw an elderly crow serving and offering food. When it said, "If anything pleases you, please give something in return," the response was, "No, no, everything is delicious, so this is sufficient." Wondering if this should be called the filial piety of reciprocal feeding among crows, he recalled that they receive care from parents for a hundred days, then care for their parents for a hundred days. So this was originally filial piety without commercial profit or loss, he thought, but it seemed the treatment of elderly parents contained a hundred years' worth of filial devotion. How much more should humans feel ashamed before these birds. The son crow said, "Today we have rice," so he thought to follow after them.

♪Well, well, it's been so long since we met. First, my greetings. Where are you headed?

♪I'm making a pilgrimage to Hachiman. From here too, thanks to your blessing, I've gained many connections.

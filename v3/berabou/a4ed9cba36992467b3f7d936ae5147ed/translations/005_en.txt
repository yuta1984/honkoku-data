Shinzaemon was, as usual, argumentative, and being a merchant above all, believed in Daikokuten. So as not to displease the deity, he diligently offered sacred sake and ate only black bean rice until nine o'clock, staying up alone and repeatedly praying: "Please grant my son good health and long life, and as he grows up, may he not be dull-witted. Though he may have a runny nose now, please ensure he won't be a snot-nosed brat in the future. I humbly beseech you for this."

To his surprise, Daikokuten appeared before him, saying "Excellent, excellent, it is I!" without any pompous airs, speaking quite familiarly: "Shinzaemon, your wish differs from that of worldly people. You don't ask for material things, but only speak of your son this and that. From my magic mallet's perspective, your request is difficult. However, since you ask, though it's not a permanent gift, your situation is special - with your natural forehead wrinkles deepened by worry. Here are an invisibility cloak and hat. I won't give them to you permanently, but I'll lend them for a while. Try wearing these." And so he lent them. Even Daikokuten, being elderly as he was, seemed to find his divine duties quite weighty.

As thanks for this favor, please feel free to ask for anything you desire.

[Daikokuten]
Though it's presumptuous to speak of food, that black bean rice is too hard. Please excuse me from that. And do shake that sake bottle well before serving.

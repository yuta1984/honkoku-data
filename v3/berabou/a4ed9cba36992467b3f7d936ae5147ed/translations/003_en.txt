Here lived a man called Shimaya Senemon who devoted himself honestly and wholeheartedly to commerce. By the time he reached his sixties, he had become a well-known wealthy man. He then handed over his medicine wholesale business to his son, changed his name to Gakujin, and entered a life of leisure. He gathered the neighborhood children and taught them about the way of loyalty and filial piety and proper attitudes for life.

"The debt to our ancestors is as high as Mount Fuji seen from below, and a mother's love is deeper than the artesian wells of the Dragon Palace. The bond between master and servant is a covenant lasting four generations, so it must never be treated carelessly," he taught gently. Moreover, he provided specific examples about how "men should maintain their households, and women should serve their husbands as well as their fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law," guiding them step by step. As a result, the children's behavior improved remarkably.

Later, when the children told their parents about these teachings, the adults said "We too want to learn" and came flocking to listen. Since he spoke these valuable teachings with few words, people found the daily lessons interesting and became completely attentive.

Originally being a merchant himself, this retired man understood people's hearts. Just as he would sell for nineteen mon what cost twenty, and for thirty-eight mon what cost forty, he offered his teachings with the same considerate spirit. His method of immediate and effective teaching surpassed even that of Buddha or Confucius.

His gentle approach exceeded that of eight scholars combined, and his skillful management was worth a thousand men. Those who heard his teachings, learned about the Way, began studying, and became excellent people are countless. The retired man's joy knows no bounds, and this joy stems from seeing how people admire and respect him.

[Following dialogue from people who came to hear Senemon's talks:]
"The more we listen, the more it penetrates our hearts!"

"This is more interesting and memorable than tedious sermons. Let's come listen again tomorrow!"

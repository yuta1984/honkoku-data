Here lived a man named Shimaya Senzaemon who devoted himself entirely to honest business practices. By the time he reached his sixties, he had become a well-known wealthy man. After passing his business to his son and changing his name to Gakujin, he entered a life of leisure and began gathering neighborhood children to teach them about filial piety and proper life conduct.

He would gently instruct them: "The debt to our ancestors is as high as Mount Fuji seen below one's feet, a mother's kindness is deeper than the moats of the Dragon Palace, and the bond between master and servant is a covenant lasting four generations—how could we treat such things carelessly?" Furthermore, he taught that men must maintain their households while women must serve their husbands, fathers-in-law, and mothers-in-law, using specific examples to guide them on the proper path. As a result, the children's behavior improved remarkably.

Eventually, even the fathers came calling more eagerly than their children, all crowding around to hear his precious words spoken with few but meaningful phrases. Daily listening became so enjoyable that even the slightest negligence became impossible.

Originally being a merchant, this retired man understood people's hearts, offering items that cost twenty mon for nineteen mon, and forty-mon items for thirty-eight mon. His immediate and effective teaching method surpassed even the Buddha or Confucius. His gentle approach, eight times more refined than typical moral instruction, and his skillful handling, a thousand times more gentle, were truly exceptional.

After hearing his teachings, countless people discovered the way of righteousness, began their studies, and became persons of the highest moral character. The retired man's joy knew no bounds, for it stemmed from the pleasure others took in his virtuous influence.

[The following are the words of people who came to hear Senzaemon's talks]
"The more we listen, the deeper it penetrates our hearts!"

"This is more interesting and memorable than tedious moral lectures. We'll come again tomorrow to listen!"

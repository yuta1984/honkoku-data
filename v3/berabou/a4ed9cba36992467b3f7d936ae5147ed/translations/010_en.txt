Shinemon found the birds' affairs amusing, and though there would likely be more interesting things to see, he hurried ahead toward Mount Oyama to worship at the Fudo temple, then planned to cross by palanquin toward Odawara. He took to the mountain path and walked aimlessly, letting his feet carry him as he wandered about frantically. But the farther he went, there was nowhere to drink even a cup of tea or eat even one dumpling. It seemed he had become hopelessly lost on the road. While it was proclaimed that there would be no disasters in the direction of Sagami, the north side of his belly was facing an immediate disaster. He walked along muttering to himself that he wanted to meet a woodsman, hunter, or even a humble monk to ask for directions.

【Shinemon】
Listen, this is about my belly's endurance.

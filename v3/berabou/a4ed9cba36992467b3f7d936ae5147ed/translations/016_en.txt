When Shinemon returned home briskly, his family's joy was beyond measure. After finishing his evening meal, Daikokuten appeared, seeming to have been waiting impatiently, emerging slowly into the sitting room.

"Now, Shinemon, you seem to have seen and heard something that gave you an interesting understanding this time, but it's all the same principle. Let me tell you about it. Without reserve, let your household hear this too.

Now, this may sound a bit arrogant, but humans are divine beings of the heavens and earth, spiritual creatures indeed. Therefore, they are the chief among all living beings, but when corrupted, some become far inferior to beasts. Even we gods feel pity for them, but because their hearts are wrongly placed, there is no principle by which to protect them. Among them, you and others who properly observe the laws of the realm, cherish your homes, and know filial piety toward ancestors - this is undoubtedly good, which is why we can be at ease with you. Think carefully about this.

No bird or beast has selfish desires. All are honest, loving only their own lives, and thus run around only seeking food. This is what they call their way. Humans are quick to say 'I am honest.' Honesty is human nature - what is there to boast about? Because they compare it with dishonesty, they mistake the true path.

You apparently don't read much, but since you've managed with honesty alone, that's fine. Birds and beasts are honest as I just said, but if that's all humans have, there's no point to being human. Make sure your son reads and teach him that humans have their own way.

People often say that reading makes one arrogant or pretentious, but such people have only superficial learning. However, reading only to nitpick details is worse than not reading at all. The point of reading even one book is to improve one's conduct.

Though people have social distinctions of high and low, hearts have no such distinctions. Even those of humble station who properly follow the way are truly human. Those with bad conduct are the same as saying 'woof woof' or 'meow meow.' This is the general outline.

You must learn. I have never spoken of such things before, but because your intention to improve society by relying on me accords with the way of a parent, I had no choice but to speak at length despite my poor eloquence. But absolutely, absolutely keep this from becoming public gossip."

[Shinemon prostrating himself]
"I am deeply, deeply grateful. My friends too are grateful."

[Daikokuten]
"Make sure he reads. I possess no treasure greater than reading. Money is secondary - I'm a bit uncertain about secondary things, but if you cannot distinguish even secondary things, then at that time, my friend, business is..."

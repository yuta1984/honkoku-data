Preface

Having quit the path of "different strokes for different folks" for two or three years, thinking it foolish, Tsutaju came with a request. When the publisher jokingly suggested that the usual tedious moral lessons and advice would be "perfectly fine by him," I stubbornly refused to make it into the kind of boastful scheme where one "runs a thousand ri wearing a tiger's skin." Instead, with my usual habit of going ten percent overboard, I had just one idea in mind. My greatest specialty is creating something that grandfathers and grandmothers can bring as gifts to children, something that costs nothing for reading aloud together. This Tsūshō himself relates.

Abbreviated Calendar
by Ōishi Koishi Mikage

From the auspicious direction,
the bold characters are
pillars of Daikoku—
the calendar too
marks spring of a precious year

Young Greens
Even the New Year performers
and the evening meal's
vegetable storehouse—
eating roadside plants
is early young green picking

Last year's large and small [months]
did not reach the paper costs

No matter how much kyōka there may be,
what a terrible place
to pick young greens!

Spiced Sake
by Yasoji Ujito

For many years,
layer upon layer,
with this spiced sake
the face of perpetual
congratulations grows weary

"Spring wind and spring water come at once"

Enticed by spring winds, we board—
the Mitani boat is rowed
and even the hurried year
draws fresh water

Itchō comes
in a shared boat

"Just a bit, just a drop"—
one cup is precious indeed

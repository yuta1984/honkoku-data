Toso (New Year's Spiced Sake)
　　Minematsu Kaze
For a thousand years
　　The unchanging gate's
　　　toso sake—
　The bag's color too
　　begins to dawn
　　　　　　in spring

Herring Roe
　Shishison Hiko
Ah,
　like jewels
appearing
　　in the form of
　　　fortune's bundle
within
　are packed
these herring
roe
　indeed

　Sakanoue Chikusō
The belly's
　　　fan with
its attached
pivot that never
　loosens—
behold it as
　the backbone
　　of this
　　　reign

[Dialogue]
Today both Honchō and
　Hakuraku should
　　　be visible

By all means,
　I'd like to hear
the impromptu topic
quickly

Using a cutting board
as a writing desk—
that's the auspicious custom
from last year's first meeting

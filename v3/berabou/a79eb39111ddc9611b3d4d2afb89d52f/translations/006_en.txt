Cedar Chopsticks
by Hiwada Kugitake

Throwing New Year's gifts
by the handful
into the gate
with congratulations,
passing through Sugi Bridge

#2
Year-end Gift
The nightingale's lodging
and the blooming plum blossom signboard
reflected in this year's checkpoint placard

#3
Today is
the day when Lord Kanko
is in the midst of calligraphy practice,
though it's the day of the dog

#4
The critique of the scroll
of amusing kyoka poetry
is probably not yet
completed

#5
Chopped Kelp
by Kyoma Naisoku

This too is fine
chopped kelp
that the tobacco shop owner
brings as a year-end gift,
calling it a dropped treasure

Year-end Gift
Without grudges or resentment,
if we serve first
at year-end,
the other party will also
send dried cod

#6
In Marunouchi
we must serve
four or five houses

Long Noshi (Ceremonial Gift Strip)
by Jiguchi Aritake

The auspiciousness is
countless
rice bales in
the storehouse
opening—
even if read
endlessly
the inexhaustible
spring's
long
noshi

This year especially
in the new house, what an auspicious
spring we welcome!
The second day is Susaki
The third day is Yoshiwara
The fourth day is Mukōjima
The fifth day is
theater
How auspicious! How auspicious!

Hair Oil
by Anagashiko

This morning early
combing the willow hair
with
oil
wearing clothes
in the spring breeze
green
rustling

Five-colored Thread
by Kisadamaru
Sky blue too
peaceful
spring's
evening thread
also
comes
drawn to
New Year gifts

Cherry Candy
by Kimushika
In a small bag
with noshi
just a
sign
of spring
presenting to
your eyes
flower cherry
candy

[Dialogue]
Looking around
willows and cherry blossens
mixing with
deep green grass
the capital becomes
a spring brocade picture
indeed
what a
long
song, Utamaru!

For Aritake-san's
poetry month
surely
Enshūya
and
Ōsakaya
that's how it
remains

On the way back, let's stop by
Jūzaburō's
shop
and buy
new jōruri

At Honchō Second Street's
thread shop
appearing good,
a daughter of
fine siblings
asks
"Excuse me,
Keigi-san"

Ochiai-san's
nishiki-e prints
have come out again—
how wonderful,
how nice!

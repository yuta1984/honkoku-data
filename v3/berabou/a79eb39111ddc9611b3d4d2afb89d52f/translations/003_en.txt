Tenmei First Year, Year of the Ox

Preface
For the New Year's felicitations at the beginning of spring, we faced the auspicious direction and celebrated joyfully, offering our respects three times. Now, for the New Year's Day at the beginning of the year, we should properly express ourselves through the way of poetry and renhai (linked verse), but since people are being driven and encouraged to participate in kyōka (comic verse) gatherings, it's like cats and ladles all becoming wooden clappers, or valley nightingales forgetting their role as go-betweens, or splashing water on a frog's face. This has been quite beneficial to the bookstore. Also, since the New Year's Day customs have become old-fashioned year after year, people from all directions compose comic verses about the amusements of illustrated books and printed materials, and New Year's gift books of two or three volumes. If you gradually take a look at these, it would truly fulfill our wishes. Though there are many matters in our hearts, in order to await the opportunity for a grand gathering, we cannot elaborate in detail with our humble brush. Respectfully and humbly submitted.

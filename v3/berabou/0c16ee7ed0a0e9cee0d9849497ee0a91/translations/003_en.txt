Preface

While reading my friend Koikawa Harumachi's work "Mueki Iki" (Record of Useless Matters), I dozed off and in my dreams saw the state of the realm during the reign of the 33,333rd Human Emperor, when the world was governed in even greater peace. What I saw was exactly as described in "Mueki Iki" without the slightest difference. I then gathered up the matters that had been omitted from that volume and compiled them into this small booklet. Thinking "Oh, how I would love to live long enough to actually witness such times," I have tentatively titled this work "Chōsei Mitahiki" (Record of Things I Wish to See in a Long Life).

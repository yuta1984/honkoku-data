Female pilgrims to Sekison are more numerous than male ones.

Sekison-sama's mountain has also gradually had its trees cut and cleared, with roads widened and houses built up densely, to the extent that there's no place left for tengu to live. Since this has become beautiful pilgrimage...

Losing one's way among the white bush clover, falling from the tops of cedar trees and breaking one's nose, or breaking one's teeth - having no choice but to become an ordinary mountain ascetic to blend in. The mountain ascetic hands over his helmet to the tengu and becomes a layperson.

Those Yoshiwara fellows can be seen!

I want to eat those honzan (main temples)!

Carrying such things is entirely like the forced straw crafts of Omuri Village.

Mother, my shoulder hurts.

This child is being ridiculous.

I'm completely exhausted now.

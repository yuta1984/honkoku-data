Sumo wrestling is an event during the rainy season (tsuyu).

♪This time's Jizōgatake is indeed a small man, but he's one who doesn't fall.

When there's sumo, it always tends to rain, so they build theaters to prevent rain leakage and hold thirty-day performances even in rainy weather.

They decorate the reception room with banners.

Please have some kashiwa-mochi (oak leaf rice cakes) or black sake.

My sister wants to fiddle with it, which troubles me.

In the old days, there used to be something called chimaki, but hearing such stories is rather boorish.

It is said that those who die during the equinox period within three years have a good death, while those who don't have an inferior death. Though both Yoichibei and Kanpei died during the August equinox of that year, proving this to be false, nowadays people have greatly misunderstood and believe that those who die within three years during this period are sake lovers, while those who don't are teetotalers - which is quite amusing.

"I want the rain to stop. Buddha, please make the rain stop."

"With this heavy rainfall, there's no way to visit graves during the equinox."

"If tomorrow is the middle day, my house won't be any different from a meeting hall."

During the equinox period, the weather is always bad, and especially on the middle day it's said to be stormy and indeed becomes very stormy. At that time, rice prices fluctuate wildly.

"No matter what, it's bad weather as a sign of the equinox period."

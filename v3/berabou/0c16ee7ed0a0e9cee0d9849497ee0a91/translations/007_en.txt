There is a gathering for cuckoos (hototogisu).

In ancient times, the cuckoo seemed to appear only in the mountains, so in old poems they invariably composed about "mountain cuckoos." In the mountains, they would likely have trouble finding food.

"Don't drink so much, Mr. Cuckoo."

"First, the punishment of the cage is quite harsh."

"Did they hang the cage on the iron rim? Cuckoo, what do you think of that?"

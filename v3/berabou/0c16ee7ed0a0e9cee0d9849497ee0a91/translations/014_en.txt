In Edo, Bashō's grave mounds have increased to about thirty or more locations, and haiku poets make pilgrimages to them. They walk around chanting the master's hokku (opening verses) set to melodies.

♪First～ at Ushi～jima～'s～ snow～viewing～ mound, come now, let's go snow～viewing～ and stumble～ until～ our～ hearts～ are～ content

Walking the thirty-three locations is a bit easier. Like the Chichibu temple exhibitions, I'd like to gather all the Bashō mounds in one place.

[Pilgrim's back] Pilgrimage to Bashō's thirty-three grave mounds

After three circuits, a Kikaku mound was built. When there's too much sunshine and it's bad for the crops, if you pray for rain at this Bashō mound, rain falls immediately. Taking the four-beat rhythm, two people pray together, saying:
♪Evening shower, if you are the god who watches over the rice fields, not sending rain would be a grudge that we'd bear from dawn to dusk

I invited Kantsū, but he said he went to Katase the day before yesterday. He's going to pay respects to Nichiren's trials, but if that's the case, walking around Edo today would be just as good. What a worldly fellow he is.

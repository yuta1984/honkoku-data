In the twelfth month, kagami-mochi rice cakes of five to six sun
or even one shaku, each
with decorations, pickled items, ceremonial arrows,
with go boards attached - how much?
With two measures of gomame sardines added -
how much? According to orders
we'll deliver them. However,
from the first day of the twelfth month we send out
year-end messengers, around the 20th we prepare
food provisions, and from around the 21st
year-end forgetting parties and visiting courtesans begin.

From this year
onwards
the eldest son's
ceremonial arrows
let's stop and
just give
the newly born
one's portion
that's it

These days it's really
already
year
forgetting
forgetting so
I can barely
sleep properly
so sleepy
I can't stand it
Tonight there's a new
courtesan buying and
until tomorrow
let's drink heavily
That letter is
the usual
one I suppose
After all
New Year's is
profitable
mark, yes
belly/profit

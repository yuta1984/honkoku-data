When August comes, people avoid moon-viewing, so no customers come to Yoshiwara. From around the 11th to past the 20th, they close up shop and take a break.

Why is it that moon-viewing involves no food?

If we're going to be this idle and have sake and side dishes available as usual, it would surely be wonderful.

At temples around Fukagawa where Japanese pampas grass is planted and called "Ogi-dera" (Pampas Grass Temple), people come to the guest rooms, set up shoji screens all around, and enjoy listening to the wind rustling through the pampas grass above.

That rustling sound of the water somehow lacks charm.

During this time, let's go to the deer temple to listen to the deer.

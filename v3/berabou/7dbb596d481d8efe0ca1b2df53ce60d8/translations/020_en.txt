[Daiji and Seita-ro's Dream]
Daiji handed over all the head clerks, clerks, and household goods, and also transferred all the houses and estates in various places to make up the one million ryo, becoming impoverished. Realizing that the tasteless affairs of this world are truly like a dream, Seita-ro likewise achieved enlightenment, and both men agreed to shave their heads and set out on a religious pilgrimage.

Those who possess one million ryo and those who squander one million ryo were both born naked. How amusing! Namu Amida Buddha.

[Seita-ro's dialogue, bottom right]
So this is what "awakening from a dream" means. That enlightened expression I had when performing noh so casually—I truly understand it now at this moment.

Well, well, what strange dreams there can be. Dreaming within a dream, reaching the heights of fifty years of prosperity, then realizing it was all like a dream and becoming a monk—but were the prosperity, the shop opening, and even the simple noh performance all just dreams?

The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven... eh...

You just took a little nap there—did you have any dreams? You still seem to be waking up as if you can't quite shake off the dream.

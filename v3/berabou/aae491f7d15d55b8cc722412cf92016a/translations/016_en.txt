When Ikkyu taught the koan of "Does a dog have Buddha-nature?" (kushifusshou) to a lay follower, this person said, "Kushi means a puppy. I cannot understand how this has Buddha-nature." So Ikkyu replied:

"The actions of a person who follows the example of a puppy can become a Buddha or enter hell"

When the person said, "I somewhat understand the part about the dog now, but there are parts I still don't comprehend," Ikkyu responded:

"When one says 'nothing,' do people think it is nothing? Like the voice of an echo that might answer"

Upon hearing this, the lay follower achieved enlightenment and returned home.

In August, when fierce winds blew and damaged houses everywhere, Shinuemon came to the temple asking, "How is your dwelling?" Ikkyu replied, "The wind doesn't reach me, it's peaceful here," and then recited:

"My immovable rock foundation stands firm—no wind blows, no rain wets it, no wind touches it"

When asked, "Where exactly is your hermitage located?" Ikkyu replied:

"My hermitage is in the southeast of the capital where deer dwell; people call this world Mount Uji"

The visitor said, "Your enlightenment poem is truly precious," achieved understanding, and departed.

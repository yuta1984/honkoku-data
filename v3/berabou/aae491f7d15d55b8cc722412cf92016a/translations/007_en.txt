One year-end on New Year's Eve, money was needed for rice cakes, but Ikkyu had spent all his money and didn't have even one mon for tea money. Wondering what to do, he was standing around the Tachiuri area when, as evening was approaching, he suddenly took the earthenware from a pottery merchant who had about one kan-mon in sales proceeds, saying "Oh my, oh my" and deceiving him. Due to his poverty,

he had become quite shabbily dressed, and the merchant, being a weak man, fled home in a panic saying "Oh dear, oh dear!" He secured his carrying basket on his back.

Two or three days later, he set up a notice board by the river: "[unclear characters]
One: This time I made a request for financial assistance and borrowed one kan-mon in cash. Now that I have prepared the money on this side, I would like to repay the aforementioned money. Someone should come to collect it [unclear characters]. The above.

Seeing this, people said "Truly, this could only be Ikkyu!" and from this time forward felt even greater admiration for the priest.

Now, the wooden statue of Ikkyu at Daitokuji Temple's Shinjuan was recently made by [unclear] temple patrons or perhaps his disciple followers. They had preserved Ikkyu's hair in a bag. When this wooden statue was created, they [unclear] placed the brocade hair [unclear] upon the hair [unclear]. People from various provinces, beginning with the capital, came to Shinjuan longing for his [unclear] condition, and when they worshipped this wooden statue, the fearsome appearance of his countenance could be compared to [unclear].

How increasingly venerable - an awe equal to that of Dharma Patriarch who faced the wall for nine years.

Willows are green, flowers are red
The verse says:
The matter of pilgrimage is finished
Today is the time
Breaking the staff
Burning it in June snow
Kidō's writing, the reincarnated old master of the realm
Written by Ikkyu Sōjun at his end

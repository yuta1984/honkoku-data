Here there was a samurai named Ninagawa Shinuemon who, in Zenshū (Echizen Province), devoted himself to Ikkyu and often received lectures on the Mumonkan and other teachings. He habitually carried a bow and arrows and loved hunting. One time he caught a cold and fell ill, and as he was already approaching death, he called for Ikkyu and requested final guidance. Just then, flowers began falling from the sky, music could be heard, sacred mirrors shone in four directions, purple clouds drifted by, and miraculously, the three Buddhist deities of Amida appeared for the welcoming ceremony. They manifested to receive Shinuemon. Seeing this, the local samurai in the area enviously prostrated themselves, saying "How truly wonderful! Lord Shinuemon's rebirth in paradise is without doubt." Shinuemon also gratefully put his palms together, but Ikkyu laughed heartily and said, "Now then, Ninagawa, when will you use that bow and arrows of yours? These three deities seem suspicious. Shoot down these three deities!"

Shinuemon started with realization, nodded decisively, drew his five-man bow to full draw, released it with a shout, and when he looked at what fell with a thud, what had appeared to be the three deities of the welcoming ceremony was actually an old tanuki raccoon dog that had been shapeshifting.

Ikkyu's mother was a follower of the Pure Land sect. She spent her days constantly reciting the nenbutsu (Amida Buddha's name), but Ikkyu composed a text called "Hōgo Mirai Kagami" (Dharma Words Future Mirror) and sent it to his mother. However, she did not achieve much enlightenment from it. Ikkyu said, "Indeed, it is natural to have doubts about not becoming a Buddha through nenbutsu.

For example, there is no obstacle in going from this place to a hermitage in Settsu Province. This is because we know the road we usually take. For someone who doesn't know where my hermitage is and comes for the first time, this is delusion. Let me dispel that delusion," and he taught his mother with these words:

"The blind and musicians come following the voice. This is the beginning of enlightenment.

Quickly, before there were no parents, and you have no one to blame you for [unclear text], neither Shakyamuni nor Amida ask about age. What we call a storyteller is precisely an unprompted narrator. When we say 'unprompted narration,' one remains silent."

"Please observe this state of mind," he said, and his mother, now having achieved enlightenment, composed a poem:

▲The Mother's Poem
If I speak, I don't speak; if I don't speak, my heart is troubled—
Could the Buddha be in the moment before thinking?

▲Ikkyu's Reply
Now there are no clouds hanging in my heart
There is no mountain for even the moon to set behind

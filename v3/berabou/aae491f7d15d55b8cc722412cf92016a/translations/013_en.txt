△The way to read the mountain-shaped poem above is:
《The mountain is high and near to the inner court of Tusita Heaven》
《The mountain is quiet and represents the Flower Treasury World》
《The mountain welcomes and the connected peaks proclaim the Buddha Land》
《The mountain is level and transforms into the secluded source of Buddha Ground》
《Mountain spring's blossoming advances the awakening mind》
《Mountain summer's cool breeze awakens from worldly passions》
《Mountain autumn's falling leaves—emptiness and more emptiness》
《Mountain winter's pure snow—silence and more silence》

【Lower Section, continuation of the story about writing the eulogy for Kobo Daishi's portrait】
"What a learned Zen master indeed!" they all said, wagging their tongues in amazement. When they showed this to scholars, they felt "What an exceptionally witty person!" Even now, this eulogy's calligraphy is said to be Ikkyu's brushwork and remains at Mount Koya. Finding it too hard to part with him, they said "At least allow us to offer you one meal of hospitality." "Very well then," he said, and briskly ate some grilled miso with tea over rice, then swiftly descended the mountain.

【From here begins the second volume】
On another occasion, Shinemon visited Ikkyu and was treated as a guest. In the course of various conversations, he said, "The Buddha observes five hundred precepts. At the very least, one should observe those basic five precepts." Ikkyu replied, "Those are unnecessary for laypeople. I tried to have even monks observe them, but it's impossible. Even this fan, barely one foot long, causes me to break the five precepts—it's better not to try to keep them at all."

Shinemon said, "Well then, does even this fan cause you to break the five precepts? How remarkable!"

Ikkyu was in Omi Province fishing, earnestly catching fish. When he caught a sea bream on one occasion, the nearby monks all criticized him. Ikkyu said, "What do you monks study? I am imitating the ancient patriarch masters. Come now, let me show you an ancient example," and he drew a picture of Emperor Xuanzong fishing for sea bream and composed a poem: "The wise patriarchs of old fished for sea bream; I, being a fool, catch and eat fish."

Therefore, what we call enlightenment in our Zen sect is mind-to-mind transmission (ishin-denshin). Shakyamuni Buddha, who needed no spiritual training, is said to have attained enlightenment at thirty.

Therefore, our patriarch Bodhidharma, as we learned from ancient times, once when the Venerable Prajñātāra held up a brilliantly shining jewel and showed it to three princes, testing their minds by asking whether each would treasure this jewel. The two elder brothers said there was no treasure superior to this jewel. Though Bodhidharma was only seven years old and the youngest prince, he said this jewel was merely worldly and not a true treasure - the jewel of wisdom-light was the real treasure - and threw away that jewel. The venerable one was amazed and said, "What a wonderful verse from such a young body," and immediately named him Bodhidharma.

Bodhidharma means a mind that has mastered and penetrated all things and has been polished and refined - a pure mind. Therefore, the ancient way does not depend on age, and the old monks, beginning to feel ashamed at seeing this, rolled up their tongues and fled back home.

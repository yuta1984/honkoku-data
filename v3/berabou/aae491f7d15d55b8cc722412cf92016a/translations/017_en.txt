Ikkyu constantly said, "Since I am one who has attained enlightenment in all things, I should not seek great worldly success in this Shinshu-an hermitage."

However, he did write down matters of renown throughout his lifetime. The master wrote that □ is □□□□. He himself said, "I am the reincarnation of Sado," and wrote down many other □□ matters. Among these, in his final testament he wrote: "I, as a lion, after a hundred years have passed, came from China. Think of my burial place as my reincarnation. Also, in the year that marks two hundred and some years, dig up my corpse and examine it. If the form has decayed, surely think it false." These things he wrote should be seen □□□. From people □□□ should not □□□□□. This year marks one hundred and eighty-three years.

At that time, Zen Master Ingen came to Japan, and since he said it had been over a hundred years, there is no discrepancy. Is Ingen the reincarnation of Ikkyu? If so, the two hundredth year is now seventeen years away. This corpse too shall not decay. Also, according to another writing, since he studied the poetry of Hanshan extensively throughout his life, this could indeed be called the reincarnation of Manjushri Bodhisattva. The various opinions and rumors concern this Ikkyu.

This he wrote beforehand as his final gathering and scattering:

Dimly for thirty years
Plainly for thirty years
Dimly and plainly for sixty years
At the end, I offer a handful of excrement to Brahma
I borrowed
Last month, yesterday, I repay
This month, today

"Of the five things I borrowed, I return four; now I return to the original emptiness"

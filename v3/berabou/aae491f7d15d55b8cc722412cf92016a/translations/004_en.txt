A certain person from central Kyoto invited Ikkyu, saying "Please come visit us sometime, bringing burdock root." On one occasion, Ikkyu visited in a mysterious manner, coming as a guest monk.

Now, the master of that house had heard about Ikkyu beforehand, so when Ikkyu arrived, he decided to test his spirit. He served all the dishes with rice bran piled on them. When Ikkyu lifted the lid of the bowl and saw it was all rice bran, he said, "Well, well, master of the house, so today's Buddha must all be rice bran dealers!"

The host was startled and deeply impressed, and afterward served the real meal.

From the age of fifteen, Ikkyu Osho wrote various things including calligraphy practice, which confused everyone. When someone requested, "Please write something lengthy for us," he replied, "That's an easy matter," and said, "Well then, I shall prepare a lot of ink," and had ink brought.

When that person presented the paper they had brought, he spread it out about two ken (roughly 12 feet) wide, dipped a palm-fiber broom in ink, got on horseback, and drew long lines across it. When the person was astonished and asked, "What is this?" Ikkyu replied, "It is the 'shino-ji' of shallow dreams seen."

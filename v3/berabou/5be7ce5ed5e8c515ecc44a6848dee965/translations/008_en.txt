The vulgar people of this world exaggerate needle-sized matters to the size of sticks, and stick-sized matters to the size of pillars. But regarding the compassionate fishing boat Heiji bringing home the mermaid, someone spread the word that fishing boat Heiji had treated the plague god to fish at Shinagawa offshore, and in return for that favor, the god had said:

"Hereafter, you should hang up a sign reading 'Fishing boat Heiji's lodging.' Then the plague will never enter this house," and with this teaching they parted. When this story spread among the people, crowds flocked to Heiji's house wanting him to write protective charms for them, causing Heiji great trouble.

♪ "Master Heiji, please give us one! Please give us a charm!"

♪ Heiji shook his head saying, "No, no, that's a lie," but everyone refused to listen from the very beginning.

【From here begins the middle volume】
Just as the Buddhist scriptures say that when one dog barks madly, ten thousand dogs follow quietly, people came pushing forward one after another begging for plague-prevention charms. Heiji was at his wit's end - he couldn't very well explain just that he had taken a mermaid as his wife, and even if he revealed the truth no one would believe him, so he had no choice but to go along with the plague god story, which was quite amusing.

♪ Now Heiji had made the mermaid his wife, and during their evening conversations when he heard about how she was abandoned by her parents, his pity for her grew more and more. Though some suggested they could charge admission and make her a sideshow attraction, Heiji, free from greed, would not agree and instead took good care of the mermaid.

♪ Heiji didn't know what mermaids ate, but when he finally asked and brought her red bean rice, this was a confusion between mermaids and goldfish.

"I don't like such things. Sweet rice crackers would be good," she said - truly showing the food preferences of a carp's offspring.

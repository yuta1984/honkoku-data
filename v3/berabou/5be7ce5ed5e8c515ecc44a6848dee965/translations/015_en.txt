Here there was a scholar of natural history living near Heiji the fishing boat owner. When he heard that Heiji was going to make the mermaid into a courtesan for business, he showed him [a text] and said:

"In the Honzō (Materia Medica), there are two types of creatures called mermaids: the tei-fish and the shi-fish. Also, in the Record of Strange Things it states, 'Resembling human form, about one shaku in length, with a small hole on top of the head.' But I didn't know such monsters actually existed. Also, it has been said since ancient times that those who lick a mermaid will live for a thousand years. In any case, it's something that can make money," he said, and Heiji was greatly delighted.

He immediately put up a cheap sign at the gate reading "Longevity Medicine - Mermaid Licking Establishment." What greedy vulgar people, obsessed beyond reason and deviating from Tenmei-era standards, wanting to live long lives! Hearing they could live a thousand years, they came one after another to lick, which was truly foolish.

♪However, the licking fee is one ryō and one bu per person. The same price as calling for a mid-rank courtesan.

♪You have an even fouler mouth.

♪Heiji grins nearby

♪Get into the rhythm and lick away!

♪Get into the rhythm and let's lick!

♪For those doing the licking, it's like sake cups for sworn brotherhood at a feast, or the master's wife when he's away, or perhaps drums and water candy, soy sauce Kinzanji miso, sesame miso, yuzu miso, sugar miso. Ah, get into the rhythm and lick away!
*Dokutsu-doku-su, kodo-kodon-don* (drum sounds)

♪A thousand people want seconds

♪Everyone licks in order according to their numbered tickets

Each person's face while licking looks extremely satisfied

♪Get into the rhythm and let's lick!

♪I'd rather lick the lower parts more

♪Even though she's a mermaid, she's somewhat embarrassed and hides her face with a hood

This tale takes place about seven thousand nine hundred years ago, and if you listen to it in an ordinary way, it may seem like a lie, but it is certainly not false. The mermaid is naturally immortal, and when Heiji was about to age, he would lick his wife all over, so this couple is still alive today, now living as private citizens and serving with loyalty. Who knows how much longer they will live - compared to Tang Fangshuo, they are only a hundred years different and escaped the incantations for warding off misfortune, but they have plenty of money and are still alive today.

Truly, unlike the contrived happy endings of other kusazōshi (illustrated storybooks), this is a specially ordered, exceptionally happy ending.

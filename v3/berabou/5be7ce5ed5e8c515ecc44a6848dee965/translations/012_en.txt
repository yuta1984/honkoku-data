Denzō of Maizuru-ya paid seven ryō and two bu, but has dragged in quite a troublesome creature. Being a man who has always been inclined toward twisted schemes, he suddenly hits upon a wicked idea: he renames the mermaid "Gyojin" (Fish-person) and plans to make her his top courtesan soon.

♪The master is planning something outrageous. He'll surely be beaten for this, mutters the female hairdresser under her breath.

♪I hope the servants don't overhear. Well now, seven ryō and two bu for one [creature] is quite cheap, isn't it? Even large bonito cost more than that.

♪I'll put this one at the front. For her hair, a horizontal hyōgo style rather than shinobu would be better - it makes her look taller.

♪I've commissioned the costume sewing to Kyūrin of Tamachi, so it will be of fine quality.

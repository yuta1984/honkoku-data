Here again, in the vicinity of Hatchōbori in Kanda, there was a man called Heiji of the fishing boat, who made his living by constantly fishing offshore. One time, at Shinagawa offshore, a female monster with disheveled hair jumped into his boat and was munching on something, which frightened him terribly. This was the mermaid born between Urashima and Koi, who had taken human form in these waters, and was already seventeen or eighteen years old - if she were a real human, she would be in the prime of her beauty. With a mischievous face, she was as beautiful as if painted with rouge and white powder like Rokkō, Mangiku, Shokukō, and Gunzan-tomi.

"Even though her body is that of a fish, fishing boat Heiji shows a bit of frivolous romantic interest, thinking it's not entirely hopeless."

♪ "I am called a mermaid and am a precious being. Please make me your wife. Hold me and sleep with me."
"I won't listen to that."

♪ "No matter how fine the body, since the sleeping posture is that of a fish, they say when you go in, you also come out the same way, so it's bad luck."

♪ "At this age, choosing a wife - isn't that your body's decision? You scholar of fins, you've gotten things backwards by getting caught on the fishing hook of your own smooth talk."

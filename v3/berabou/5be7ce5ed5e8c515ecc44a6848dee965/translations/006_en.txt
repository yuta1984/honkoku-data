Now the relationship between Urashima and Koi became deeper than the latrines of Shinagawa or the wells of Kōjimachi, dyeing indigo upon indigo to become a lapis lazuli-colored love path. It became a matter that required a two-shaku five-sun hand towel headship, and finally Koi became pregnant. So Urashima too suffered various heartaches and secretly had her give birth, but shamefully, since it was a child born between a human and a fish, its head was human but its body was fish. This must be what is called a mermaid. However, when this matter became known to the Dragon King, it would mean grave danger for both of them, so though it was pitiful, they abandoned the child secretly in a certain place - how heartless this was.

♪ "Ah, if I too were not of the Dragon Palace, I would pity this child and raise it up, and if I took it to Fukiya-chō, Shinagawa, or Ryōgoku, it would surely draw crowds. But I have no choice but to abandon this pursuit. Even after it grows up, be sure that the showmen never find it."

Thus, the boatman Heiji made a great fortune in a short time thanks to his wife, and now lived a life wanting for nothing. The young shopkeepers in the neighborhood enviously eyed this success, and judging Heiji to be an unattractive man, one of them thought, "This fellow doesn't find people smelly as humans, nor does he find the mermaid fishy." When Heiji was away, this neighbor snuck in and made various lewd propositions to the mermaid, but she remained chaste and virtuous, refusing his advances and slapping him away with her tail fin.

"However, even this body of yours must be cautious around Mukojima."

Heiji had successfully become wealthy, and in his further greed, though not like Doi no Jiro, being only around twenty years old, he was an amusing rascal. Being of the same nature himself, he couldn't let his guard down around his wife and kept licking her. The more he licked, the younger he became, which delighted him so much that he forgot himself and licked too much, eventually becoming a child of about seven years old. Now the wife was a mermaid and the husband a child - what a ridiculous situation this had become. The expression "he went too far" (namesugi) probably originated from such circumstances.

♪"See what happened? You licked too much. That's right."
♪"Wife, what should we do about this? Ah, now I want to drink milk."

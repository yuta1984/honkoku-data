Enjiro became increasingly carried away, and while doing this and that, the seventy-five day deadline expired. His family sent daily demands that they would not forgive his disinheritance. However, since he still hadn't had an affair, through the mediation of relatives, he requested a twenty-day extension.

"Surely there is no one as frivolous as this," he thought. Though he was prepared to throw away his life, that wouldn't be fitting for the floating world, so planning a fake love suicide, he first consulted with Kinosuke and arranged for them to stop him at the signal "Namu Amida Butsu" (Buddhist invocation). He then ransomed Ukina for 1,500 ryo and gathered the props for the love suicide.

The pattern on his final kimono had a golden hand-basket on the shoulder and an anchor at the hem, embodying the sentiment of the old poem "even in old age, a drifting life." This too was profitable for the tea house and Yamazaki.

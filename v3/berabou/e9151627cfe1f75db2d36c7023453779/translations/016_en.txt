《Stage direction: Adagiya Enjiro | Ukinaya Ukina》Michiyuki (Lovers' Journey) - Exciting Goosebumps

〽To see beauty in the morning and die in the evening would be acceptable
Yet what frivolous words these are! Those are the stern characters of the Analects, while this is the soft skin of Bungo musical narrative
The cord that the two naked people tied, when one tries to
untie it alone, cannot be untied. If we doubt and fall
with a thud from the height of the suspicious embankment, would our names become famous? Which courtesan ties beautiful louse-ribbons, even the gods
turn away. Like grilled dried squid with sanshō pepper soy sauce that curves tautly, what was once
the bustling Naka-no-chō district, the outer figure-eight walk has now become an inner seven-character walk
as they trudge along. Though they would wipe away the tears mixed with runny nose,
having no hand towel, they wrung their loincloths
The east wind penetrating their bodies raised goosebumps on their bare skin
The master's face appears like a love letter hidden in light ink
Writing a letter seeking temporary news, with kana syllables like an iron crowbar
Even the hem reaches, the familiar color flowing into whatever of Nanatsuya
on the Sumida River, each making unreasonable demands like those at Uozaki
The bell at Yotsume and Chōmei Temple, for you

Opening the chest on a day and again
After four o'clock, crimson silk crepe
loincloth
Long
spring
day's
midday
at the
temple
hanging out to dry
Naked and hurried
rushing along《Stage direction: Triple pull》
The ox, from its wish, lets flowers
pass through, and Enjiro's
cunning love suicide
at this time suddenly became
famous throughout society, even appearing
in pictures on
summer fans

【Enjiro's dialogue】
I was truly acting
out of whim
so it can't be helped, but
you must be very cold
In ordinary lovers' journeys, people wear clothes
to go to their final scene, but ours
is a naked journey home -
what a great contradiction!
A crimson silk crepe loincloth
serving as hakama here
is quite amusing

【Ukina the courtesan's dialogue】
What a true
case of being
dragged into trouble!

Enjiro, with the spirit of a courtesan from the pleasure quarters, decided to donate lanterns for the temple exhibitions at Ekoin Temple and Doryo-son. He commissioned Kinosuke to have his name and family crest combined with his lover's in a "hiyoku-mon" (paired crest) design.

Kinosuke accepted the commission and ordered from a lantern maker in Tamachi. He also ordered hand towels from Nakaya, also with the paired crest design, to be dedicated conspicuously to various popular deities. This too was quite an extravagant affair. Of course, he had no particular wish to pray for, but making such dedications was indeed a frivolous matter.

【Kinosuke's dialogue】
"This is terribly urgent work. Make the frame with shige-bone bamboo, use proper lacquer finish, and brass fittings. No matter how much it costs, make it really splendid."

【Lantern maker's dialogue】
"I can't finish it so quickly. Right now I'm working on cherry blossom lanterns for Yoshiwara."

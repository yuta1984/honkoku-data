Enjiro returned home on a particularly cold evening, and when he entered the house shivering from the cold, he found a white kimono for memorial services hanging in the alcove. Puzzled by this, his father Yajizaemon and the head clerk Hyosuke emerged from an inner room to admonish him.

For the first time, Enjiro came to understand the ways of the world and became a true person, giving up both courtesans and his bad habits with no desire to go elsewhere, and took a wife. Having sufficient family fortune, he prospered and flourished in the end.

However, as a final conclusion to his lifetime of philandering, he wished to spread his story to the world in the form of a popular book, and requested Kyoden to write it as a lesson for other libertines in society.

When young, one's passions are not yet settled and one does not know there are various things to be cautious about, but when one reflects on everything, this is how people are. It is indeed frightening.

【Father and head clerk's dialogue】
"You have wasted yourself away with such foolishness - this is our devised performance. You must surely reform your behavior. Won't you stop associating with bad companions? It's not just about being stingy - there is great misfortune in the house, someone with such a disposition."

【Enjiro's dialogue】
"I have caught a terrible cold. Since I'm causing such jealousy and great trouble here, I should find somewhere to send my mistress away too."

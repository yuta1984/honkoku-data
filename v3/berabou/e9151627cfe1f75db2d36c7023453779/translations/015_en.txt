The final scene was also
to be lively
and dramatic, so
they decided on the embankment of Sanmeguri,
but since it would be
eerie if night fell too deep,
they planned to do it
during the early evening.
The tea houses, old inns,
entertainers, and geishas
who had served Enjiro
came out in great numbers,
dressed in hakama
and haori as if for
an official escort,
and saw them off as far as Okawa Bridge.
Around the area of
plain Yakushi temple,
they parted from everyone.
Enjiro, his heart joyful
that his long-cherished wish
had come true,
performed the lovers' journey scene as they went.
"Here is the perfect final scene," and with his white fan

he drew his wakizashi sword, seemingly
about to kill,
and using "Namu Amida Butsu" as
the signal, from behind the shadow of Inamura
two thieves
in black garb
appeared

and stripped
the two
completely
naked,
robbing them

【Thieves' dialogue】
Since we're going
to die anyway,
I'll act as your
second
and help you along

【Ukina the courtesan's dialogue】
I never
thought
such a thing would happen

【Enjiro's dialogue】
Now, now,
don't be hasty.
Our love suicide
is not meant
for actual death.
Someone should
stop us and
we should escape.
How did this
go wrong?
I don't know
how it went astray.
We'll give you
all our clothes,
so please spare
our lives

【Thieves' dialogue】
Don't ever
come up with
such foolish
schemes again

【Enjiro's dialogue】
We will never
fail to learn
from this
experience

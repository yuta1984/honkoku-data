Title: Edo-umare Uwaki no Kabayaki (Complete)

[From Episode 29 of "Berabo": This book was commissioned by Tsutaya Juzaburo from Santo Kyoden to avenge Sano-sama (Sano Masakoto), who stabbed and killed the lover (Tanuma Okitomo) of the courtesan Taga-ga-sode. In the drama, the dim-witted man appearing in Kyoden's "Tenugui Awase" (Hand Towel Competition) was adopted as the protagonist of this book because he closely resembled Sano-sama. It was also considered a rehash of Harumachi's Kinkin-sensei.]

En'nirō, after watching kabuki theater, thought that playboys were supposed to be beaten up, and desperately wanted to be beaten. He hired four or five tough men from the outer districts at three ryō each, intending to be beaten in a prominent place in Naka-no-chō. He employed Tōbei at the second floor of a teahouse to sing ballads, and planned to let his disheveled hair create romantic rumors. He painted his shaved pate with indigo dye and had his hair done up in mizugami style with silver ornaments from the mountain districts, arranged so that when someone grabbed his topknot, it would fall apart immediately. However, when he was actually beaten, he was struck in the wrong place and fainted. Instead of having his hair combed, there was a commotion with people calling for "smelling salts and acupuncture needles!" until he finally came to. This incident earned him quite a reputation as a fool.

"Those fists cost three bu each. Even if it hurts a little, please make sure it looks really impressive."

"They say cutting off the topknot brings divine punishment. When a handsome man like you shows up, the courtesans get all flirtatious and it's unbearable, so the line about me being a bit jealous - that's something I'm ordering them to say."

En'nirō heard rumors that people only associated with him for his money because he was wealthy. Suddenly disgusted with being rich, he desperately wanted to be disowned and pleaded with his parents. However, since he was their only son, they absolutely refused. Finally, through his mother's mediation, they agreed to a seventy-five day disownment, after which he would be quickly brought back home.

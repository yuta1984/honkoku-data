《Title: The Same - Origins of the Procession》
The life of a courtesan
was entirely like a journey.
In the melancholy travels of living day by day,
changing from yesterday's patron
to today's change of
saddle at the rear, rushing to one-night
stays in visiting rooms,
or lodging during river closures.
Patrons going up to Kyoto,
when concentrated, there are
fifty-three stations.
The great gate's checkpoint
clings closely,
boat palanquins,
or rather
on horses of different
routes.
When standing, the lower back—
Hakone's eight ri
even horses cross,
but what cannot
be crossed
is the promise
of the appointed day.

Enshū Hamamatsu appears wide
but narrow sideways, the quarter's fifty chō.
Hanging the service Potalaka around the neck,
Chichibu, Western Provinces, Bandō—
new attire.
One night, two nights up to
one hundred temples,
striking bells
to make a living
in this world of
pilgrimage.
Coming
journeys,
meeting journeys,
visiting
journeys.
In journeys with people
and familiarity,
this quarter
therefore
when the oiran parades
through Naka-no-
chō,
it is also called
a procession.

【A courtesan in a woven hat, called "Tayori" by the oiran】
〽One step tired, I've become so tired that the pigeons
at Kannon's temple could pick up
the beans that have spilled—how annoying!

【Oiran】
〽Tayori,
hurry up
and walk,
or we'll arrive
at the inn late!

【Kamuro attendants】
〽In such
attire
we suddenly
departed—
night boat,
carry it on your back!

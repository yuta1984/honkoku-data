《Annotation: Courtesan Oiran Animals》《Title: Number Seven - Yamatoya Okadera》
This morning, my heart as a regular customer staying continuously is just like the light of gold.

In the usual sea there is a boat landing called Ōkuzetsu. Behind it you can see Mt. Hyōbu. When this mountain becomes cloudy, tears of rain fall from the sky. On the right is the Shrine of Guests, on the left is the Jizō of Lovers. The shrine of guests is a close path, but fundamentally uninteresting. The Jizō of lovers, wherever it may be, is an interesting path. Because people wander wondering "shall I go to a lover or visit a guest," this place is called the Crossroads of the Pleasure Quarter.

♪Even Jizō's face gets angry by the third time. Why are you hiding your sexual affairs like that?

Please, since you're a customer, please stay here. Because I'm the proprietress, even preparing hot meals - what karma is this?

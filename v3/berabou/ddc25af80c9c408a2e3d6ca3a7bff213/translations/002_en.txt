Kansei 9 (1797)
Songs of Convenience for Northern Province Pilgrimage

Preface by the Author
Among dancing girls there is the Thousand-Armed Buddha (Kannon). Among courtesans there is the Nyoi Ko-Kannon. Manifesting as the Long Fugen of Hōshaku (Muromi), and in the hell of Takatsu, Ikkyū chastises (the deluded). During the years of having no dwelling in the three realms, it must resemble the journey of the Tripitaka Master. The nights of austere practices and painful disciplines are equal to the ancient times of Prince Siddhartha. In the bedchamber of true reality without defilement, leaping over the folding screens of the five dusts and six desires, the pilgrimage songs of earthly passions and enlightenment are precisely the author's great skillful means. Opening the ears of ordinary people, my hundred sermons should also be understood as the moral teaching of just one picture.

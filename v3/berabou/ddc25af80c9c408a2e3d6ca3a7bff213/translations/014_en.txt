《Annotation: Bakuren (Dissolute Love) Saint, Customer》《Title: Number Twenty - Yamashiroya Yoshimine》

Those with strange tastes carelessly spend money's face, better than good intentions - the embarrassed anger

From Mushin Pass to the monkey's crotch is one stride. At this place, though it's not the monkey and Suzuka road, because one gets rejected and exposed, it's damp. Sukebei Shinden, persistent village - truly a place of the world's long duration. Selling the eggs of fellows who say "going home, going home." From the unreasonableness of quarrels, a raccoon dog emerges to the brothel quarters. Nestling close to the den of sleep, Nezu Myōjin stands. They say only those with money get the torii gate.

In song: Unable to grasp the moon of the courtesan's heart, a monkey customer goes mad in the pleasure quarter

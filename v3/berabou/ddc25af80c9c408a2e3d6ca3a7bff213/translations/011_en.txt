《Annotation: Two-room six-tatami front》《Title: Number Eight - Yamatoya Hatsuse》
The heart that comes for many summers, from evening time - both boorishness and melancholy are one's own skin

The source of the River of Lies is the pure water of each hand. In this area there is a shrine where gods frequent. They sell the famous "grilled eel of infidelity." When the pure water of each hand rises and swells up to the neck, one crosses the river of one's own body. From this place emerge troublemakers. The River of the Body flows only for eight months. There is a forest of spear-chestnuts. The golden abyss is said to be downstream of this river. One must be cautious and fearful.

♪This time, having discussed it first and had it tailored, singing that it was worn for the first time today - those who boast like this are all from rental shops with borrowed items, and when they claim it as their own, only their body is truly theirs.

♪Master, that striped pattern suits you very well.

♪If those guys suddenly go off without us, it won't look good for us men. Both of them, crossing the river of their own bodies with all their possessions - tonight's attire is for the sake of rental borrowing.

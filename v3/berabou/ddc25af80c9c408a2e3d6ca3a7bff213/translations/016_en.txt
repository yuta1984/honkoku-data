《Annotation: Merchant's poison, Daishi's customer》《Title: Number Thirty - Harimaya Chikubushima》

From Kubitsudake to the true abyss, ten ri; at the pond of mutual infatuation, circling around the mirage water, the pursuers' bridge spans across, and by any route one returns to the quarter of being drawn back. In this area, they sell a bleached cloth called "kappa-sarashi." This is entirely a demonic place where one loses the way of benevolence, righteousness, and the five constant virtues. One should be very, very cautious.

♪Don't you move!

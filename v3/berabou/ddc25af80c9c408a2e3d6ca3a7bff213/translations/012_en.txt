Under the flowers, caught by a flowerless courtesan, ascending in triple-layered kimono at dusk

At the famous ferry crossing, where the courtesan rows the boat. When they say taking the customers' mood as port rudder, the parlor duties respond as starboard rudder. Occasionally when night winds blow, they raise sails in drunkenness and go mad at the helm.

♪Oh yes, yes, being a courtesan's child, naturally she doesn't know this steering.

Rowing all through the night to see the moon in the chamber, customers are white waves on the moat's oak leaves

Getting off the famous ferry with smooth talk, it's the well for sending off and welcoming. The morning return specialty - oak leaf rice cakes from small boats. Customers returning with miso have miso-sweet oak leaf rice cakes, sleepy faces. The moon appears to have stayed up all night in purification.

♪I've included these sweet bean cakes too. Please rest, turning them into oak leaf rice cakes all the way to Yanagi Bridge.

♪Becoming oak leaf rice cakes is also a painful role.

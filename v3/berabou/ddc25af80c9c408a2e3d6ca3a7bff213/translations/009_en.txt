From the river of lies to Mawashi lagoon, it's a three-ri beach area. At this place, you can see Mt. Horai of the two-day moon - a geisha beach. In ancient times it was called Maiko Beach. The drum-bearers of the waves beat their way in. There are slopes of two ascents and three descents. At the border between Yomi-se and Hirumi-se, trees called Sugasagi are planted. The local trees break from time to time, flower songs bloom, and when you reach the Hikiyotsu mountain, everyone climbs up without exception. Those who fall behind draw落茶, settle matters, and stop.

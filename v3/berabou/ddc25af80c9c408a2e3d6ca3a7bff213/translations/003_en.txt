《Title: The Origins of Northern Province Pilgrimage》
When one inquires in detail about the origins of courtesans performing pilgrimage processions on the Hachimonji (Yoshiwara pleasure quarter) thoroughfare, long ago there was a shinzō (apprentice courtesan) registered in the sixteenth ledger who called herself Hanayama. Following the advice of a patron who visited her, she escaped from this quarter (pleasure district) and, dismissing her customers, began striking temple bells starting with the first worship on January 2nd, chanting for the sake of charitable giving, and concluded her pilgrimage around December 24th or 25th at the Miagari Kunishaku gold Fuchitani group.

The Tōsai Zuihitsu states: When the holy monk Shōkū of Shosha encountered a courtesan named Chō of Murozumi, when the monk closed his eyes, Chō appeared in the form of Fugen Bodhisattva, but when the monk opened his eyes again, she appeared as the courtesan Chō. This was indeed a mysterious occurrence in the vicinity of Kameyama, a place of supernatural beings.

・Text for striking temple markers:
"Namu great compassionate and merciful. Guest deity great bodhisattva. Ten times ten hands each. Customers' pleasure above. Self and others equal. Reverent faith. Creating Buddha."

Song:
"At Murozumi's
self-indulgent pleasures, though
no lies are spoken,
    randomly spirits rise—
    ah, how interesting!"

This is also said to be the beginning of pilgrimage songs.

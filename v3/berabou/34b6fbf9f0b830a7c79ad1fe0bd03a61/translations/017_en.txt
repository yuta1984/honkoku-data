Twenty-Four Filial Piety Buddha, Guardian Deity of the Filial Emperor
This Buddha holds a golden sickle in his right hand
and bamboo shoots from the snow in his left, making
scales from ice, riding upon
a carp that emerged from the ice, with many
mosquitoes clinging to his body - this shows
that without such painful
hardships and ascetic practices,
filial piety
cannot be achieved

Japanese-Chinese Loyalty Buddha
Long ago, during the reign of Emperor Go-Daigo,
this Buddha was carved
from camphor wood,
colored with lacquer
that people of the new
world applied to their faces,
with gold leaf from Amakawa-ya Gihei's gold dust used as gilding, standing upon a single lotus flower.
This is the guardian deity of Ōboshi Yuranosuke. When these two
Buddhas are revered and the thousand ancestral bodhisattvas of family occupation
are treasured, descendants will prosper and wealth will come, becoming
wealthy Buddhas without doubt. This is the
blessed origin of household exhibition.
Know that this is why we speak of "household Buddhism" and "belly nenbutsu."

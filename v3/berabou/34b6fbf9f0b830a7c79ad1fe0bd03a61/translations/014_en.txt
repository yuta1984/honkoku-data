The certification seal for viewing the Great Wisdom Sutra (Prajnaparamita) written in gold ink on indigo paper - this has been
transmitted to the descendants of the Thousand-Armed Bodhisattva
and is also connected to the Kyoto courtesans
and the white dancers of Dojoji Temple
Theater may be a spectacle
that wraps up
the nature of
prolonged evil
and confuses
people,
but when
viewed
badly it
leads to
debauchery
and dissipation
Therefore,
instead of
watching plays,
view this
Great Wisdom
Sutra
transcription
certification
and be satisfied -
such is the instruction
♪The wooden statue
of see no evil,
hear no evil,
speak no evil -
to see is a virtue
of the eyes

When viewing beautiful women,
the heart immediately
melts
and one ultimately
loses oneself
Also when hearing
musical pieces like
"Evening Mist and Tears
together
crossing the Koshi road" -
though knowing
this attachment
is the way
of love,
when one hears
such things
sung in
beautiful
voices,
this too makes
one's spirit frivolous
and is not good for oneself
The mouth is originally
the seed of disaster
All harm to oneself
comes from what the mouth does
The Thousand-Armed Bodhisattva
carved and left
this wooden statue
as a warning to
descendants
By taking this vow, there will be
blessings

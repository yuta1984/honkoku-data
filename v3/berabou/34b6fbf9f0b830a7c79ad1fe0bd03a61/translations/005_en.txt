Now then, let me tell you about
the exhibition buddhas
within your own
homes.
Made by
bodhisattvas,
they are called
Family Business
Tathāgata.
Without
voice
they call people,
creating markets
of regular customers
gathering for worship
before the gate.
The profits of three thousand
forming mountains—all of this
comes from this Tathāgata's benevolent
virtue and skillful means.
That is to say,
this sacred image is
the Golden Man
and Woman Perfection Sage
of Infinite Thousands, with divine skin,
a Buddha of personal wealth
and possessions. In rice shops, it

manifests as a bodhisattva,
in money exchange
houses as a golden Buddha,
in vegetable shops as produce,
in sake shops as sake, in fish shops as
fish, in brothels as courtesans,
among farmers as cattle and horses—
manifesting in all forms,
from the master above
to the maidservant Osan below,
the shop apprentice Chōmatsu,
the rice cook Sankei and
all others, delivering
all sentient beings
of the household.
Though the
sacred name
changes according
to each house,
it is one body, one Buddha
who resides
there.
In worship,
be careful
not to put
the left
before
the right.

Family Business
Tathāgata brings
blessed
benefits. Take care
not to neglect Ancestor
Bodhisattva, lest
punishment befall you.

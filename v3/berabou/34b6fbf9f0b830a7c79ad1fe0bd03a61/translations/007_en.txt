Next, from when the founding master entered lodgings,
his worn old clothes and torn loincloth
that he wore, his carrying pole, and other items like
pestles, mortars, cat bowls, and abalone shells—
all the various household
implements found in the house are
precious treasures and sacred relics of each family.
It is his sacred vow that those
who worship them once will be spared
from the evil deeds and disasters of arrogance.

Among the many sacred treasures,
there is a sword called "the sword that is never drawn."
This sword, long ago in the markets
of China and Japan, when a Chinese
fish seller named Kanshin
crawled between someone's legs, was the sword
he wore at his waist.
Since then, having passed
between this person's legs,
it became a sword rare
in this world. Later
it was passed down to the house
of a warrior who was a mirror-polisher
called Kannin Goro, defeated and now Saburo.
One time Kannin
Goro got into
an argument with
Rokusuke of
Hanakawado.

Rokusuke put his foot on
the hilt of that sword
and said "Come on, draw it, draw it!"
but "No, no,
others' evil
is my own evil.
If I draw
this sword,
I will destroy
myself—
such is the principle."
Kannin Goro
endured his resentment quietly.
At this moment, his headband
dirty and thin,
from this sword
blazingly
brilliant light
was
emitted.
From this time,
all people
revered this sword
and called it "the light of the sword never drawn."
It is the foremost treasure of our temple.

♪"Rather than dealing
with such a fool,
it would be better
to quickly
escape
from here."
"Not needing morning rice gruel,
rushing to urinate—why would one
use withered
greens for that?"

"Come on, draw
that sword, Roku!"

♪"This courtesan—is she Agemaki
or Matsumaki or whatever—
I don't know, but she's
a rather annoying courtesan."

The picture-mirror of women's heart for attaining Buddhahood says: "Outwardly a bodhisattva, inwardly a demon"
Women are particularly sinful beings, chattering
incessantly with their mouths, and when touched, become the subject of people's gossip
Though their appearance may seem beautiful, their hearts within are
those of demons. Look and see yourself reflected in this mirror - such is the teaching

The Bag of
Patience and
Endurance
This bag is a precious
bag. You must ensure
that the cord of this bag
is not cut
Within it are stored
the treasures
of the Five Constants:
benevolence, righteousness, propriety,
wisdom, and trust

♪The purification
box breaks,
the bamboo - if descendants have
any intentions, lend a pillow

At times, use this purification box
and strike it out with this split bamboo -
such is the admonition of the Thousand-Armed Bodhisattva.
"Could it come to this?" - 
even such a poem exists

♪The master's punishment,
the parent's punishment -
there are two kinds of punishment
Even slightly
neglecting one's
master or parents
when this
punishment
strikes one's
body

♪In military strategy and incense appreciation,
quoting Zhuangzi:
"Though the crane's beak is long,
if you cut it, it will grieve
Though the duck's beak is short,
if you extend it, it will lament" - and so on
In all things, staying within
one's proper station is best
A drum that surpassed
the temple is useless
- such is the
parable

Somehow
this certificate's
dance
thanksgiving
method
is like
kagura's
summer drying

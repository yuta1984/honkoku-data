Long, long ago, in times even more ancient,
there was a temple called Setaiyama Ikkaji Temple, and the head priest was called Baibai Osho (Commerce Priest). Through his specialty of this secret art, what is called "money wisdom" would be this. He always guided people using parables and skillful means. Now, parables and skillful means refer to taking familiar examples to lead those who cannot speak properly or read and write into the true path, and indeed the Buddha already set forth a separate "Parable Chapter" in the Lotus Sutra.

This Commerce Priest, in a sermon one day, said: "The fact that various buddhas and bodhisattvas come forth from distant lands to the capital, and there are special exhibitions where country folk can worship various buddhas, is a most blessed connection. However, sentient beings do not know that exhibition buddhas exist in the world, that exhibition buddhas exist within our own homes.

So in today's sermon, I shall explain the reason why there are exhibition buddhas in your homes." First positioning his fan at the lectern, clearing his throat and taking a sip of tea on the high platform, the gathered worshippers listened with pricked ears.

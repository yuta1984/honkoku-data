The Image of the Poverty God
Sake is the poverty god of merchants
Why is this so? When one drinks
sake, the mind and body
become dissolute and one's trade
becomes sloppy like a
fallen Buddha,
and immediately
one becomes poor.
Therefore, if one refrains
from drinking sake, occasionally
even sweet rice cakes would be
no great matter.
There is a sacred mantra:
〽What goes with sweet rice cakes?
Bean-filled buckwheat noodles perhaps

Ah, King of Hell
The arrogant Heike clan
finally met their
end in
Tang China
The text says:
First, fire prevention is crucial; be
loyal to your master and filial
to your parents; let husband and wife, brothers
live harmoniously; don't drink sake,
don't buy courtesans, don't eat
large meals; get up quite
early in the morning and
sleep late at night.
When you grasp money,
it should not
be let go.

〽The five-story
　　　　　　　　treasure pagoda built by ants
Merchants should
build like ants' towers,
little by little,
bit by bit,
taking time
to slowly profit.
For this purpose,
the admonition is that
the wealthy cannot
achieve enlightenment.
For this reason, even acrobats
say "ant tower, ant tower"
to show people
the meaning of
this treasure pagoda.

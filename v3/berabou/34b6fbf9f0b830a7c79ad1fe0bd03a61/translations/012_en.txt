The Venerable Image of Debt-Severing Reclining Buddha
With just one drink at a time, becoming utterly impoverished
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　This is a venerable image
This is the creation of fine sake lees, one sho and three go
It is said that in Magozaemon's house
this has been passed down, and once
one worships it, the body
immediately becomes
drunk and collapsed,
such is the divine nonsense
Every year on New Year's Eve of the twelfth month
there is an account book of sake purchases
with the total tally
Also, house purchase accounts
are no concern, so
with that mind, one should guess
at future business
and be warned
This is from Kenshishi Mountain
Manganji Temple

The Koban
Sucking
Priest
Mochimaru
Bestows upon
the wealthy
The wealthy's
six-character
sacred name
The Venerable Image of Ass-Eating Kannon
This is also made from the same wood as the Reclining Buddha
When good earnings lead to defaulting on debts,
rice shops, firewood shops, and miso shops
all become victims of the Ass-Eating Kannon
This is an evil Buddha
This too was carved
by the founding ancestor
bodhisattva of this temple
as a warning
not to do business
with such Buddhas

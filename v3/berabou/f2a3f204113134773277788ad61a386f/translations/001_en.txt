【This is the 39th Berabo tale. As guild members were required to conduct censorship before publication, it became difficult to write about the Yoshiwara pleasure quarters. The author presumed that if he published it in袋綴じ binding with "Educational Reader" written on the cover, there would be no surprise inspections from the magistrate's office, so he decided to sell it as one of three volumes. This incident resulted in Kyōden being sentenced to fifty days in handcuffs】

Preface

In the pleasure quarters of the eastern capital where birds sing, the enjoyment of impromptu performances (niwaka) originated from the early years of the Meiwa era, when there were signs of this in Gion-bayashi and sparrow dances. It first began in the autumn of the fourth year of the same era [Meiwa 4, 1767]. After being interrupted for some time, it was suddenly revived the year before last and continued through last year. The festivities have grown more prosperous with each passing year, and the artistic concepts have become increasingly entertaining. Since this serves as a mirror reflecting the flourishing beauty of this quarter, I have decided to transfer those arts and, without falling short of the fragrance of lantern flowers, to create lingering emotions of the bright moon and serve as a herald of autumn leaves. Taking the request of a certain refined patron as an autumn flower, without distinguishing between professional entertainers and amateurs, without rejecting either young apprentices or daughters, with no yielding between myself and others, and by not separating others from oneself, the words of niwaka have been arranged. How could this not be appropriate?

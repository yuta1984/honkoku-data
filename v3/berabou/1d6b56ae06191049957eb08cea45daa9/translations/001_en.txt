"Sato no Bakamura Mudaji Zukushi" (Complete)

[Berabo Episode 22: A parody of the bestselling primer "Ono no Takamura Uta-ji Zukushi" written by Koikawa Harumachi, who had lifted his ban on satire. Depicts scenes of Yoshiwara using Koikawa's invented characters.]

[Wasteful Characters of Fool Village in the Licensed Quarter]

[The character 𦽳 in the title combines bamboo (竹) + foolish (愚). Since it's an invented character that cannot be displayed, 𦽳 is used as a substitute. It's a mockery of "Takamura" and is read as "bakamura" (fool village).]

【In "Berabō" episodes 28-29, Santō Kyōden suggests to Tsutaya Jūzaburō that they should submit hand towel designs. Because a man with a flat nose in frame 11 of this book resembles "Sano-sama," he conceived the idea of publishing "Edo-umare Uwaki no Kabayaki" with this man as the protagonist.】
【Author: While Kyōden's younger sister Kuro is credited as the organizer of the hand towel competition, it seems unlikely that a fourteen-year-old sister would have been so active, and it is believed that Kyōden himself created most of it】

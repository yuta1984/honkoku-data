From then on, the crab took the aforementioned persimmon seed to the mountaintop and said, "If you don't grow quickly, I'll cut you with my claws!" Though plants and trees have no heart, it became a large tree in one night, and many persimmons ripened.

The river crab Hasami-no-suke was troubled. Though he wanted to pick the persimmons, he could not climb up to the branches and could only gaze at them.

A monkey came running to this place and said, "I'll climb the branches and pick them for you." He picked and ate the ripe persimmons, but threw the unripe ones at the crab.

[The monkeys' dialogue:]
"This is to be shared equally!"

"Hachibe, delicious, delicious! I've eaten the tasty ones!"

"The good ones are for us!"

"That stubborn crab - ugh, so sour!"

[The crab's dialogue:]
"Don't throw them so carelessly!"
"Ouch, ouch!"

"You're throwing nothing but unripe persimmons at me!"

"What ill-mannered creatures these monkeys are!"

Long, long ago, it is said,
A mountain monkey and
A riverside crab were
Playing around the mountain.
The monkey picked up
Persimmon seeds,
The crab picked up
Cooked rice,
And they made an exchange.

"Please exchange this
Persimmon seed for that
Delicious-looking
Cooked rice.
Moreover, this is
An Echigo persimmon
Seed. When you plant this
And persimmons grow,
Please give them
To me."

"That's easy enough.
I'll plant it and offer the fruit to you."

Those who practice horsemanship probably don't possess money trees either. Spending all their daily earnings on courtesan fees for "horse riding," they now have no choice but to grab any men and women passing by on the streets, thinking that with such variety of temperaments, it would surely provide good practice. The pleasure quarters, both inside and outside, united to push down and mount any men and women they encountered, regardless of propriety. This caused tremendous uproar, with fights and arguments never ceasing.

【Dialogue of the maidservant of a woman being forced to become a "horse"】
My mistress's drum guard, I won't let you escape even an inch!

【Dialogue of a man trying to make a passing woman into a "horse"】
What's this drum guard nonsense? You're being sluggish. We have orders from the authorities to practice martial arts - specifically horsemanship, which is the most important skill in battlefield tactics. Just shut up and let yourself be mounted.

【The Emperor, observing the city's condition from his high palace】
Well now, this is truly outrageous behavior. Looking at this from afar, it closely resembles the scene at Yanagihara's twenty-four mon district.

♪Climbing up to a high building and looking down, I see the people stirring up commotion with their pretentious behavior in the streets.

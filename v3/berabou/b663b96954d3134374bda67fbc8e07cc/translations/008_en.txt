The disciples of Chinzei Hachirō (Minamoto no Tametomo) became very numerous. Among them, Kotarō, the only son of Unno Tarō, at the age of seven shot through a nanban iron helmet. This being such an extraordinary feat, they made a votive plaque of that bow, arrow, and helmet and dedicated it to the Kannon of Kiyomizu.

The disciples of Yoshitsune and Oguri Hangan, hearing this, became concerned. Yoshitsune's disciples dedicated a plaque of the thousand-man slaying at Gojō Bridge, while Oguri's disciples had an artist paint a horse using the ancient sword technique and dedicated that plaque. Among these three plaques, the horse plaque shows only the artist's skill, but still, what a dedication it is!

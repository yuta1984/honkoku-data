Preface
The "Quli" (Book of Rites) states: "A parrot can speak well, yet it never leaves the realm of birds. A courtesan can speak well, yet she never departs from her provincial dialect."《Marginal note: I too am the same》When I say I create illustrated storybooks, I never truly depart from imitating others. I am like those talking birds from the time of Emperor Qin Shihuang, similar to parrots, so it is said.

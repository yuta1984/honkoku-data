Oe no Masafusa became Doctor of Literature, and from that time forward, Minister Sugawara's work "About the Bow-Tube Bird" was read daily at the academy before the court nobles. The audience grew day by day without cease.

"Now let me explain according to proper method. In the section on great talent, let us read Minister Sugawara's 'Bow-Tube Bird.' First, the governance called politics that rules the realm and nation requires three things: timing, momentum, and position. It is like a spring carp ascending a waterfall - this is described in detail in Minister Sugawara's 'Bow-Tube Bird.'"

【Dialogue of people gathered for the lecture】
"We're a bit late. It's already started."

"Minister Sugawara is a blessed person. A wise man of recent times. He is what they call a Zhu Xi scholar."

"Is that about the revival elixir?"

"The names of daily attendees are recorded in the register."

"Just one page of classics takes until around 10 AM. Every single day without meeting the court nobles, rustling away."

Oguri Hangan Kaneuji was a master horseman who rode a wicked horse called Onikage (Demon Bay), so when teaching his disciples, he said that wooden horses cannot convey the true feel and balance of the saddle. Therefore, by using people as wooden horses to ride upon, one could quickly grasp the meaning. Thus, the teacher and disciples would take turns serving as horses for each other, riding and being ridden in practice.

【Dialogue of people watching the horse training】
Lord Oguri rides very well. If it's the riding style of the powerful elite's palanquins, I could teach you that.

If it's the Hachijo style, these days it's about skill even on verandas, and nowadays it's all about the straight punch, target shooting, and haori jackets.

【Oguri Hangan's dialogue】
〽The gold of Miroku Buddha, four-sided saddles, upper-bad, middle-good, lower-excellent - these are all the secrets of our school.

【Disciple's dialogue】
The teacher must be a large pot, or perhaps he's tired of being lifted up.

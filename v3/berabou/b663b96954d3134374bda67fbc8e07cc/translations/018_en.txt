The sage's
leader,
Confucius, said:
"If the phoenix
does not come,
the River Chart
will not appear."
But now
that a phoenix has
appeared, it is truly
an auspicious omen of this sage's reign,
so let us show it widely
to the people.
Since both "phoenix" and
"Hiromachi" have auspicious-
sounding names,
it was bestowed upon
the master of a tea house
called Hiromachi in front of Daitoku-
ji Temple in Murasakino,
and here it was
shown to all people.
A kirin also appeared, but
this one, like a squirrel,
　was placed
　　　in a corner
　　　　　and displayed.

Is this lantern from the teacher in Hamachō?
No, it's Sekizanjin's.

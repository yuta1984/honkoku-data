The provincial lords should raise about a hundred [kites]
If they don't raise them properly, the realm won't be governed well
For those with fifty thousand koku or more, Nishinouchi paper [a type of high-quality paper]
About eight sheets would be
good
For those of the above rank:
Nishinouchi paper
For those below:
Regular half-size paper

[Dialogue]
A gentleman does not争う [compete/quarrel] anywhere
Surely when raising a kite
From the time [of preparation], turn it and raise it up
Lower it and retrieve it
That rough [handling]
Hey there
That's a
gentle-
man

What,
a flying kite
you've mis-
taken
for something else
It's a sage's reign
that's why
such things
appeared
Have you gentlemen
walked around and seen
how good Japan is

[Main text continued]
Governing the realm
and the nation
is like
raising a kite - 
this analogy has been misunderstood as meaning
that if you raise kites, the realm and nation will be governed,
and at their good age
everyone competing with each other
to raise kites,
treating flying kites
as friends -
this too is another misunder-
standing, and true
gentlemen coming and going
is indeed strange, yet
in this auspicious reign
it has become
most
felicitous
an example
indeed

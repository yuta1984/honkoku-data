Those who practice horsemanship, having heard (mistakenly) that Oguri Hangan rode the demon-colored horse Onikage as if it were a racing horse, and since their disciples find practicing on wooden horses boring because they already know each other's temperaments from daily training, thought that if they rode unknown persons, there would be various interesting reactions. So they took horse equipment to the grounds of Kitano Tenjin shrine or to Yoshicho district, set up a riding course, and practiced horsemanship.

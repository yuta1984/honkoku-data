Not only the disciples of Yoshitsune, but others learning swordsmanship as well, upon seeing the votive tablet at Kannon, would say that swordsmanship ultimately comes from Master Ushiwakamaru, who performed the thousand-man slaying at the bridge in Bungo Province.

Though one cannot become skilled without cutting down many people, killing people brings unavoidable future troubles. So every evening, they would go out to Gojo Bridge, Yanagi-no-ha intersections, and various small streets. On fine weather nights, wearing high geta and carrying fans with the rising sun design, they would practice "thousand-man striking" on people near groves of trees or from Shinagawa and Orai.

"Well, hentarako! This makes nine hundred ninety-nine people. Just one more and I can take my leave after completing the thousand-man striking!"

〽Song: "Jidairaku ya, striking buttocks in the darkness, at Mikumano, echoing on the waterfall rapids against the servant's rear"

"Bah, step back! Because this is a wooden sword, your sleeves weren't cut - if this were a real sword, both sleeves would have been severed. With that affected Noda-style posturing, your opponent surely feels no pain. Strike with a calm heart!"

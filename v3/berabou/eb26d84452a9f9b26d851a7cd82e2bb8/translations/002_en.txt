Ōmu-gaeshi Bunbu no Futamichi (The Parrot's Return: The Twin Paths of Letters and Arms) - Complete

[This material is held by the Tokyo Metropolitan Central Library. It has the same content as the book of the same title held by the Edo-Tokyo Museum, but uses different printing blocks. It has been recopied by a different scribe, with differences in line breaks and kanji usage. This suggests that the wooden printing blocks wore down from the book being so popular that it sold extensively.]

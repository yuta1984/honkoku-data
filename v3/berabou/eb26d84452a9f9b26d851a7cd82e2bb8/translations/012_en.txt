Horses are living creatures, and no hundred horses among a hundred have the same temperament. Just because one can ride one horse well doesn't mean one can definitely ride other horses. Courtesans are also like this - just because one can please one doesn't mean one can please others. Having ridden through all the racing horses without exception, they think that if they were to "ride" courtesans from Shimabara, Maruyama, Ishigaki, Nawate, and even those from Tsuzura-kiri with no limits, there would be various temperaments and the practice of horsemanship would become clear. So they come day and night, making it their constant practice.

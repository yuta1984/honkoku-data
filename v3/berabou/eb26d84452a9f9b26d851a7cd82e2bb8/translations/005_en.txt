Yoshitsune said: "For teaching swordsmanship to future generations, since my techniques were received from tengu at Kurama's Sojo Valley, the uchitachi (senior partner in sword practice) must necessarily be a tengu. However, since we cannot suddenly summon tengu, we will have the uchitachi person wear a tengu mask, attach wings like a kite, and have people fan them up with large fans from the sides so they can perform uchitachi while flying in the air. The shitachi (junior partner) will wear high geta, hold a rising sun fan in one hand, and fight with the other hand."

【Dialogue of people fanning with uchiwa】
"Yes, that's right."

"Over there, Hyobu is having trouble hearing something from the wind. Come now, Sansuke, wait a moment!"

Since Emperor Engi cast off his eight-tan Hachijo silk robes and donned plain clothes during a quiet night, from court nobles and courtiers down to all other people, they completely stopped wearing long haori coats and began wearing kite-colored cotton Butsuzaki haori instead. Therefore, this became an example of noble poverty cited as the reign of Engi-Kanryaku until the end of times.

【Dialogue of person fighting tengu with rising sun fan】
"Yattou, ei!"

【Dialogue of person playing tengu role】
"Tooth-brushing, half-word short, if for official use, during this time, yattou, ei!"

"Having clarified through questioning, the body is surely that of a thing-tengu and cannot be stopped!"

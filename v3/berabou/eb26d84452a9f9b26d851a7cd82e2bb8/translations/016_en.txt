The combination of the sage lord Sugawara no Michizane of the Engi era and the wise scholar Masafusa's great Confucian learning created a unity, so that from the Ketsukei Unkaku pavilion down to feudal lords, high officials, and commoners, all placed literature on the right and martial arts on the left. Until recently, people read the Four Books and Five Classics with kana annotations, but now they chant and recite them vigorously with faith marks added to the kana-written Four Books and Five Classics.

For economics, it's about Chinese comparative poetry; for drinking, it's about judicial inspectors.

The temple schools are particularly interesting. The temporary residence in Nakanoshima was more cheerful and pleasant than the schools.

〽The words of Minister Sugawara's composition "Nine Official Birds" are also scattered throughout printed books and widely practiced in society.

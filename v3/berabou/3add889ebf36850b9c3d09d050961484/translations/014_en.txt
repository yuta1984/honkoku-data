Upon falling in love, I lost all strength in my legs
　　　Secret Love　　　　　　Genshin
Keeping it secret, my face has grown thin　my love is such that
People ask if I'm not eating anything
　　　Meeting in Love　　　　　　Mitoku
Embrace me and strangle me to death tonight
This life that said we would never meet again
　　　Waiting for Love　　　　　　Kakyō
Waiting for one who doesn't come, meddling that it's too late
Taking medicine of course, while my body burns with longing

　　　Pledged Love
Because your heart has fallen low, I nearly die of love
I have opened up my very life
　　　Parting in Love
When birds cry, you are gone and I am gone
These silk sleeves that we make weep
　　　Morning-After Love　　　　　　Mi
After parting and coming away, my trailing hair is pulled
This morning, sobbing, my thoughts are in turmoil
　　　Resentful Love　　　　　　Anonymous

Preface
Like the endless grains of sand on Ariake Bay's beach
That one could write about and never exhaust the words to gather,
This "Hama no Kisago" follows that example.
With rustic dialect songs saying "What's that?" and "Hey, hey,"
These country-style verses with their corrupted speech
Stand out distinctly and are sung out most readily.

[Right page]
Rather than waiting for one who won't come, vigorously blow and wring
Not knowing that the mists rise at Makuzu riverbank
　　Meeting with Growing Passion　　　　　　Entaku
The accumulated feelings of my heart open up tonight
Love like the dice of sugoroku awaits
　　One-sided Love　　　　　　Jitsugaki
The path of love also dyes the charcoal seller's unrequited love
Only saying how wretched it is
　　Mutual Love　　　　　　Kōshō
Exchanging tender feelings with each other, wagering together

[Left page]
The heavy burden of love is carried by two together
　　Being Forgotten in Love　　　　　　Ikkō
Though we became like the melodies of jōruri
How you are one who hasn't met me since then
　　Love Compared to Firearms　　　　　　Mitoku
Even if rifle bullets keep coming, if you don't let go
In the end it's Orihime's Tanegashima gun
　　Love Compared to Short Sword　　　　　　Nagamasa
Since ours is a relationship like a corroded short sword
Even trying to cut off these feelings, they cannot be severed

One: Sometimes kyōka (comic poetry) is written as "kyōka" (興歌, excitement poetry). The reason given is that this is because it brings excitement to the gathering, so the character for "excitement" is used, as seen in some book called "Nanyara." However, since kyōka that brings such high excitement to a gathering is not composed very frequently, the character for "excitement" should not be used. It is better to write it as "ebisu-uta" (夷歌), "kyōka" (狂歌), or "tahare-uta" (comic songs). The older forms should be used.

One: Collections of kyōka should be consulted. The old collections are:

[Left page]
Horikawa Eight Hundred Kyōka Collection - 3 volumes, 800 poems
Kokin Ebi-kyoku Collection - 2 volumes, compiled by Naniwa Gyōfū
　More than 20 pages missing from this collection
Gosen Ebi-kyoku Collection - 7 volumes, later 2 volumes, compiled by a direct disciple
Agin-ga Collection - 2 volumes, from Edo, by Sue

Even in the oldest collections, kyōka composed using puns (jiguchi) can be seen here and there, but poems that have become mere puns should not be adopted.

What a world full of deception this is　without even paper
The god of poverty never leaves one's side
　　　Frost　　　　　　Yukishige
Winter is just everywhere gradually　on frosty nights
The frost that settles and accumulates is something that piles up
　　　Plovers　　　　　　Yukikaze
At the shore behind the standing folding screen
They are lifelike painted flocks of plovers
　　　Spring　　　　　　Iriyasu
At Suma Bay, with the pine wind of Ariwara seeming meaningful

It falls like Yukihira himself
　　　Year's End　　　　　　Seishiki
When will I become a debt collector myself
At the very end of my struggles, there might be a banner
Love　Two
　　　First Love　　　　　　Anonymous
Since falling in love, I cannot eat anything from today—

　　　Love
How strong the feet of one who visited for ninety-nine nights!

This poem's language shows no amusing parts. Since the amusing aspect of the heart is strong, this should be called something that enters from the heart. This is indeed a desirable form.

One should compose without making it into a dajare (pun). Even in old collections, there are kyōka that read "the capital of Miyagi as good Miyake fields by people of the capital" and read "warabi" (bracken) as "warabe" (child). One should understand this and not mix in wordplay when composing.

Even if the entire poem - first, upper, and lower verses - were all read as puns, that would also be amusing. However, inserting wordplay in just one place makes it sound

painful. This should be understood.

One: Words with different kana
Kai (province) and kai (sea) - Kai is "kahi," sea is "kai"  
Au (meet) and ō (big) - Au is "afu," big is "oho"
Au (meet) and ō (king) - King is "wau"
The nightingale's "hōhoke" with kyō (sutra) and today's "kyō" - sutra is "kyau," today is "kefu"

One should understand through this type. Different kana should not be used in composition.

In old collections, there are cases where "Ide" and "ide" (coming out) are used as if they were different kana. This is because both Ide (place name) is "ite" and "coming out" is "ide."

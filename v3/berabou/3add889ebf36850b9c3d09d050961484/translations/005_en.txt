　　　　　Guidelines for Composing
1. When taking a topic, one should first seek related characters and related words.
　For example, if the topic is "hibachi" (brazier), one should consider various words such as: ◦charcoal ◦ash ◦light ◦stir up
　◦fire tongs ◦half-cylinder ◦warm hands, etc., and 
think of
　these, then compose using whichever concept appeals most. Never
　consider anything outside of the hibachi topic. Even when necessarily seeking new concepts,
　if one thinks too deeply, it becomes a side topic. Excellent phrases and
　wordplay should be sought naturally. If forced, the poem's form becomes poor and
　the meaning fails to stand. This should be well understood.

1. Although kyōka has no strict rules, one should follow the
　form of waka poetry. It is merely arranging ordinary words into thirty-one syllables.
　However, one should borrow ancient poetic language
　and insert new comic elements. Though kyōka
　is best when it comes from the heart, for kyōka seeking unusual
　comic elements and starting from wordplay is easier
　for beginners. The madness of the heart is something naturally
　acquired through composing many poems, so seek interesting comic elements and

The gold and silver he had thrown away merged with all the money in the world into one mass, multiplied, and came flying back. Finding it impossible either to stay at home or to leave, the husband and wife fled together, wandering without knowing where they were going through fields and mountains. Then the people to whom he had previously lent money, having now become wealthy themselves, came chasing after them with the borrowed money plus interest, trying to force repayment upon them. They pursued him like courtesans from the pleasure quarters, pressing money upon him.

【The debtors】
"We should drag him home by any means and keep pressing all the money on him repeatedly."

【Manman-sensei's wife, crying】
"What is to become of a rich man's wife?"

【Manman-sensei】
"Even if money with no place to put it piles up to great heights, there is still no place to put it."

【People who had borrowed money from Manman】
"We came to your residence to repay the principal and interest all together, but you cleverly made sure to be away from home, so we've chased you all this way."

"Thanks to you, we have become wealthy. What an ungrateful person you are to try to make us forget that debt of gratitude."

"If you try to hide from us, we will repay you even if we have to appeal to the authorities."

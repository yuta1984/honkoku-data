As expected, many thieves did break in, but because it was such a large sum of money, they got bogged down preparing how to carry it out and cooking preparations, and dawn was breaking. Rather than steal the money, they found it difficult to take away even the money boxes and various tools they had stolen from other places.

When they heard the voices of the husband and wife returning, they fled on foot, thinking only of themselves.

[Manman-sensei]
Surely they must have already stolen and left by now.
[Servant left on watch]
Welcome home.

[Manman-sensei, seeing that the thieves fled without taking anything]
That's why they should have at least taken a little bit. To leave behind even what they had stolen elsewhere—it's like smearing miso on one's own shins, a ridiculous blunder.

Since the money won't decrease as he wishes no matter what he tries, he devises various new plans. Setting his heart on traveling from Kyoto and Osaka to Yamato pilgrimage, considering the expenses along the way, he travels leisurely at about two to three ri per day.

It would be just right to stop at [Kanagawa] [Kanagawa post station].

Since Kanagawa has troublesome connections with money (kane), even though the sun is high, let's stay at [Kawasaki] instead.

Please just walk four or five bu-ri more.

Adding money for this purpose is said to become a prayer for the horse.

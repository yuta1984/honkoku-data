Manman-sensei took this as a good opportunity to make a pilgrimage to Enoshima, and thinking up another costly amusement, he had the fishermen dye matching fukada garments and made them perform seine net fishing. Unexpectedly, they caught an enormous amount of golden fish from the sea, even more abundant than the declining fish populations in rivers and seas, so against his wishes, his money increased again and he was troubled.

"If that were money, it would be good to name it 'Enoshima Treasury' and build a storehouse to keep it in."

"This scenery is the finest in Japan, but somehow there's an unpleasant light shining, so perhaps it's something extraordinary. How troublesome."

"Keep bathing in it much more from before!"

"Hey, hey, you're being punished for extravagant spending!"

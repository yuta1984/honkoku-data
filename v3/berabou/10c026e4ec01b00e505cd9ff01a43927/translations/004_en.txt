Since Manman
could see no
beneficial effects
from his devotions,
he devised
various schemes,
thinking that if he
recklessly lent out
everything and
caused people
in society to
default on their debts,
his money vault
would surely
be relieved.
So he hung
bundles of
loan certificates
in his pocket
and without
any concern

lent money
to every
person who
came.

"With this,
from this morning
I've counted up to
eight hundred twenty-eight,
but I can't remember
the rest.
Kohada
sushi,
horse mackerel
sushi—
how harsh
this is!"

"If there are
misfortunes
and calamities
to befall you,
borrowing would be
inadvisable."

"Since I am
but a woman,
shall I bring
a merchant
with me?"

"We shall
spread the word
extensively
and bring you
substantial
borrowers."

"Since we
speak thus,
we would never
do anything so
inhuman
as to speak
of repayment."

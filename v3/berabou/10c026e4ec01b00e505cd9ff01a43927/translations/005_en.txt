As he progressed,
like shedding
his own
cast-offs,

though the
borrowers'
income
decreased,
his money vault
didn't empty
even by
one percent.
"This won't do,"
he thought, and
once again
devised
schemes.
Since ancient times,
for the wealthy
to assume
a modest
appearance

nothing surpasses
the pleasure quarters.
Suddenly he
set his heart on
the entertainments
of the brothels.
He selected
courtesans who
appeared
splendid
on the surface
but were
struggling
privately—
those who seemed
deep in greed.
From their
assignations
he scattered
yamabuki gold coins,
adding leap months
to the
three hundred
sixty days,
enjoying
the constant
patronage
and the fall
of his fortress.

"Hey, what's this,
Kinzan-san
come here
for a moment"
"Yes, lively
fellow"

"Fortune
scatter outside,
demons
come inside"

The monk
novice
who picks up
the urge
to go begging

"This is
a precious
yamabuki
color"

"That money isn't
tree leaves, is it?
It's probably
stolen goods—either way
you're a disagreeable fellow"

Otomi thinks her companions' jest is real and looks around the street, but passes by with dignity. The people on the street also know that she had her tattoo erased, and a man from the street who was originally stubborn and short-tempered grabs Otomi's hair, pulls her close, and punishes her by kicking and hitting her.

Otomi says through tears:
"This is far too unreasonable, Rojū-san. Lately I've returned to Otoyo-san and become a nuisance, so she's grown tired of me. I heard that you suddenly needed money for your circumstances, so I deceived Raigi and borrowed twenty ryō. Out of duty I had the tattoo erased. This was all for the sake of committing love suicide with you."

【Otomi】
"However, I have not defiled my body. Those twenty ryō are here as well."

【Rojū】
"Ah, I didn't know this. I acted in anger and punished you rashly. Please forgive me, Otomi."

"I'll lend you that money, so consider Raigi's true intentions carefully. From now on, let's immediately leave together, go to some distant shore, and secretly become husband and wife and live together. Be at ease, Otomi." And so saying, he immediately takes her away with him.

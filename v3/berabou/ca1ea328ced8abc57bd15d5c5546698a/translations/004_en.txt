When the drinking had reached its peak, Bunnan took Otoyo's hand and tried various ways to see the tattoo on her hand, but she wouldn't show it. When he forcibly rolled up her sleeve, he could clearly see that Rokushirō had tattooed "Rokushirō's wife for two or three lifetimes" by his own hand.

"Well, well, what a large tattoo! It must have been quite painful when this was carved. There are similar cases too. Otomi's hand also had 'Rokushirō's wife' tattooed on it, but surely it can't be the same Rokushirō."

"I recently heard rumors that Otomi has been running to Rokushirō's place."

Upon hearing this story, his hair stood on end in fury, and he began making unreasonable accusations about things he had no knowledge of. When Otoyo threw a break-up letter back at him in return, he immediately became like a madman.

Bunnan has a hibachi (fire brazier) thrown at him.

It goes without saying that it scattered like snow in complete chaos, and people say he stood there in bewilderment, covered completely in white.

They quickly shoved him into a palanquin and sent him away.

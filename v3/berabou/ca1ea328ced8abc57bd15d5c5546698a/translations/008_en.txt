Osaka stands up in surprise.

"I have been listening to the teacher's talk gradually from earlier, but are you speaking the truth? There's no way you would say such things to someone cheap like me."

While saying this, Raigi takes Osaka and returns. Fusui puts Raigi and Otomi in front of people and has them talk about various things.

【Otomi】
"As if I would deceive anyone!"

To deceive is not commerce, not something to be sold. This is not something I would generally ask of the teacher. Just as she says "truly" and embraces him, Osaka calls out "Otomi-san," so everyone comes out to the sitting room, and that day ends there with everyone returning home.

During the year that passed while the feng shui master dozed off drowsily,
he dreamed in his slumber of the circumstances of the Sendai Mimon who tormented the dead.
Having briefly seen this in a dream, I record
this outline as
a dream tale.

【Rojū (The alley man)】
Oh my, what a long dream that was. I'm exhausted, exhausted.
Wife,
is the rice ready? Are you sighing?
Is it seven o'clock?
Are you in pain?

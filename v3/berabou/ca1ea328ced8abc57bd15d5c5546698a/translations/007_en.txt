Master Fusui at Matsuzaki tries to seduce and win over Otomi. Everyone else also goes to Matsuzaki by night boat.

"Toriyasentora"
"Don"
"Who did I think it was - it's someone from Kuwanaya. The old lady is unchanged, just the same as always from Shiohama."

【From here begins the second volume】
Raigi takes Hase with him to visit the Inari shrine. Fusui and Otomi go up to the second floor of Yatsudaya.

"Now Raigi, here's how it is. That good-for-nothing is quite smitten with you, but I know there are complications with this scoundrel. When you say 'here,' it benefits this good-for-nothing. Previously when this scoundrel left home, Otoyo gathered up kimono and hair ornaments and borrowed twenty-five ryō. Now, to make Otoyo break with this good-for-nothing, those twenty ryō must be repaid. How about you deceive Raigi to borrow money, send it to this scoundrel, and make him break with Otomi?"

Otomi thinks for a while, comes to an understanding, and waits for Raigi to return.

【Otomi】
"What nonsense."

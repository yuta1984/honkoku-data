The refined master and Rokushirō engage in various witty conversations.

"That fellow is quite troubled by the length of things. He'll do something about it. You and Kiriyama are on intimate terms with his son, aren't you?"
After various idle talk, Rokushirō gets up and leaves.

【Rokushirō's idle talk】
"Master, I need twenty ryō for something urgent. Could you arrange the financing?
Speaking of which, I sent a break-up letter to Otoyo, but I hear she's fallen for some young man from some house lately. What a bold woman! She doesn't even remember being dumped yet. I should kill her! Has she gone mad?"
So he said.

"Otoyo is impossible to deal with. When I fell ill, she stayed in seclusion for four or five days to nurse me, bathing in cold water every night and going to pray at the shrine for me."

【Scene changes to Otoyo's parlor】
Among the geishas of Hama no Masago, the changeable Otoyo【Benten Otoyo】is highly renowned. Just when Rokushirō, affected by the break-up letter mood, wants to meet her and voice his resentment, tonight's customer is Gunji Yozaemon, with some literary companion, forming a somewhat intoxicated gathering.

【Song of the geisha playing the shamisen】
If it's a true heart within the sorrowful melody

【A man with "Gun" on his sleeve, offering a cup to Otoyo】
"Otoyo-san, please have one."

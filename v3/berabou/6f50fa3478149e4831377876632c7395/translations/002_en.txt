The fox's cry of "kaa-kon-kon"
is something I started
　　　　　　　　　kon-kon

Long ago, there was a man called
Yacho (Night and Morning).
Ignoring his parents' admonitions
and people's criticism,
he devoted his heart solely to
pleasure quarters. One time, crossing
Matsutake Mountain at dusk,
he reached Nihon Zutsumi and
passed in front of Sodesuri Inari
shrine. At that moment, thinking
to himself that there was probably
no greater connoisseur (otsu) than
himself, with a somewhat boastful
heart, his wit gradually improved,
and he had become one who now
competed for first or second place
among the great connoisseurs—
how detestable this seemed.
At that time, the foremost fox,
perhaps finding his showing off
hateful, thought this wouldn't
go unpunished, and the fox
harbored a scheme
to confuse
his judgment.

When Yacho walked along absentmindedly,
he had already reached Uemon-zaka.
At the boat inn, wearing the customary
formal attire: a long haori coat,
shark-skin scabbard, rokugeta clogs,
tea-colored chirimen silk,
with black dragon-gate
family crests—his
outfit was stylish
and well-fitted,
a splendid appearance.
Just then, during the prosperity
of Shin-Yoshiwara's evening scene
in Naka-no-cho, with
three thousand beauties
all assembled,
the spectacle was such that even
Kan'ei Palace
could not surpass it, and
everyone drooled
as they gazed—there was
no one who
didn't look.

"How about it,
Kumabo,
shall we go to Negishi?
I'd like to go too, but if I go
I'll be dead drunk
as usual."

"The other day when I visited,
Kaimei-san had that usual
betting story.
Master, regarding the lecture
matter, I have already
understood it completely.
The Momoge-ju Karako
gathering was
quite lively.
The prints' pictures
were well drawn
by Tawaraya (?)."

"Well,
Karako...
Ah ha ha ha"

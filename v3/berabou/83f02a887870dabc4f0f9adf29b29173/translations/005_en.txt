What could be called a Thousand-Armed Kannon,
Even the Buddha cannot help but
In these hard times of recession,
Pitifully
The thousand sacred hands
Cheaply
For rental lending
With such a sacred vow
The shameless speculator named Senbei
The merciful hands at one ryō each
Setting the price at a thousand ryō in total
Paying the severance fee
To turn them into rental loans
Cuts them away

Starting with three hands
Once you respond, it won't
Hurt anymore
Even if there are
Bad hands
There will be no
Re-dealing

A thousand hands used up
Indeed

On this side, most
Have been cut off
Scattered everywhere
　Scattered about

Severance money
One thousand ryō chest

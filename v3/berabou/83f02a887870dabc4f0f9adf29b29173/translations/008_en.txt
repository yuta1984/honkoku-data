Courtesans without hands use the hands of Senju Kannon (Thousand-Armed Avalokiteśvara) to deceive their clients. However, since these are borrowed hands, they are often troubled when someone comes to retrieve them.

【Courtesan】
"This customer seems wealthy, so let's look and deceive him. Be careful and take it quickly."

A kamuro (young attendant) realizes that if there are hands available, it means "short-handed," and if a customer has no hands, it means "a little"...

【Kamuro】
"Even so, someone has come to retrieve them."

【Customer】
"What a frighteningly many-handed person! Like an octopus with hands!"

An illiterate fellow borrows the hands of Senju Kannon to write official documents, letters, and contracts, but since they are Buddha's hands, only Sanskrit characters come out, and none of them are useful. The miserly fellow's logic is exceptional - thinking it would be a loss just to return them, he lights a fire with the fingernails and uses them as candles. This, they say, was the beginning of manual labor - what an old story!

"Confusing Sanskrit with correspondence - even now, if there's business to be done, can correspondence be written in Sanskrit? How strange!"

"It seems hot."

"What a noisy candle!"

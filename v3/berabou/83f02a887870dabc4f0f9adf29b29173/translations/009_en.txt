At that time, demons were living in Mount Suzuka in Ise Province, tormenting the people of the land, so there was an imperial decree to Tamura-maro ordering him to "subdue them." However, without the hands of Senju Kannon, he could not achieve the miracle of "one arrow shot becomes a thousand arrowheads," so he came to borrow them.

"We have lent out all hands and don't have even one left, but we'll gather them up and lend them to you."

"For how much per hand will you lend them?"

Kannon worked through Senbei to collect the lent-out hands and loan them to Tamura-maro.

Senbei examines the returned hands:
The one lent to a courtesan is missing its little finger and returns as a clenched fist - this is from fight wounds.
The one lent to a salt vendor has become modest/salty,
The one lent to a dyer has turned blue,
The one lent to a maid smells of rice bran paste,
The candy maker's is all sticky,
The rice cooker's is covered in chilblains,
The one lent to someone who pounds rice is covered in beans.

The index finger and middle finger have a strange smell. This one is a bit puzzling.

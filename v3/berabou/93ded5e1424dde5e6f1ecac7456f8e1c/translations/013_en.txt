Saying "ganrai no kongen no" when one should say "motoyori" (originally) is off-putting
Saying "irai no kōgo no" when one should say "kasanete" (again) sounds bureaucratic
Saying "makari-ide rare makari-kaerare mashita" instead of "yoso e iki kaeraremashita" (went out and returned) is also disagreeable
Saying "chinchō ni zonji masu" instead of "medetaku zonji masu" (I think it felicitous) sounds like formal correspondence
Saying "bantan ryōken" instead of "yorozu no hakarai" (various arrangements) is tiresome
Saying "midomo dōzen" instead of "watakushi mo onaji koto" (I am the same) sounds masculine
Saying "bakudai ni enin shimashita" instead of "ika ni oso nawarimashita" (how late it has become) is also stiff
Saying "taimotsu kōchiki" instead of "atai muzukashiki" (the price is high) is unpleasant to hear
Saying "ōjō nasare rinjū yoki" instead of "osuki nasare owari yokarishi" (passed away with a good end) sounds masculine
Saying "kōbutsu nite hōshoku nasaru" instead of "suki nite mairi suru" (I am fond of it and partake) is too formal

Besides the above, there are countless more examples, but there is no need to write them all down. One should understand by analogy from these examples. Besides these, vulgar words like "kuiyatsu," "dare me," "suki toshika," "hidoi," "gebiru," "yaku," "ikiji," "kisashi," "sui," "ki no tōru," "omowaku," "sō shita koto," "oteki," and such fashionable words of the time - a proper lady should never utter even one of these words. You should be prudent about this.

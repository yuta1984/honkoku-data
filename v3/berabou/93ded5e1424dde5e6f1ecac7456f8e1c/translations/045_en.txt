All can conceive. Looking at the world, lowly people have many children, but shoguns and daimyo, despite their wishes, cannot have children. Therefore, they select and employ concubines who have borne children, but even with various efforts, conception remains elusive - this appears to be due to the lack of karmic connection from previous lives.

Truly, shoguns and daimyo live in paradise in this world, while lowly people live in hell and as hungry ghosts in this world. Therefore, the seeds of buddhas who are born in paradise are completely absent in this age of degeneration and turmoil, while the seeds of hungry ghosts born in hell are as numerous as clouds and mist. Thus, becoming a buddha is extremely difficult, and understanding this through the lack of children among the upper classes, women of noble status should have faith in buddhas and gods not only during ordinary times but especially during pregnancy. If they do so, the children born will be wise and intelligent, and childbirth will be peaceful.

1. How to determine whether one is pregnant or not
Grind Chuanxiong (Sichuan lovage) into powder, one monme, and drink it with a decoction of mugwort leaves on an empty stomach. If on that day you feel something moving slightly in your belly, this is pregnancy. If there is no movement, it is not pregnancy but illness.

Also, brew mugwort with good vinegar and drink about half a cup. If there is frequent pain in the belly, this is pregnancy. If there is no pain, it is not pregnancy but illness.

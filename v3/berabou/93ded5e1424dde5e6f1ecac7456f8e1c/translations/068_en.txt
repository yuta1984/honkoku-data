The koto is one of the musical instruments that ancient sages and wise men played for entertainment. In both China and our country, it is an instrument played by women, and there were many master players in the past. The koto has thirteen tunings, with irregular pieces such as Sugagaki, Rinzetsu, and Shika-odori. Even if women cannot play skillfully, they should at least learn how to tune it and memorize the names of the various parts of the koto. In ancient times, the koto had fifty strings, but later the number was reduced, and today's koto has thirteen strings. Counting from the far side, among the thirteen strings, the eleventh is called "to," the twelfth is called "i," and the thirteenth is called "kin." The raised part on the right side is called "ryūkaku" (dragon horn), and similarly, the small opening is called "ryūzetsu" (dragon tongue). The raised part on the left side is called "unkaku" (cloud horn). Above the right dragon horn, there is a twisted paper cord of mizuhiki called "makura-ito" (pillow string). On the left side, there is a carving in the shape of an oak leaf called "kashiwa-ita" (oak board). Beside it, damask is stretched, which is called "ō-ginu" (royal silk). There is a seat where strings pass through called "ito-todome" (string stopper). On the back left side, there is a hole called "inketsu" (yin hole). On the back right side, there is a hole called "marigata" (round shape). Both legs are called "mukae-ashi" (receiving legs). The bridges are called "hashira" (pillars). Playing is called "tanzu."

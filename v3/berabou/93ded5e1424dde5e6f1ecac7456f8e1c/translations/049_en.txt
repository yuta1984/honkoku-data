㊃About the maternity belt during pregnancy (appendix: daily positioning, fetal descent)
Generally speaking, pregnancy counts the tenth month from the month of menstruation as the month of birth.
The first month is described in medical texts as being like white dew, and in Buddhist texts as being shaped like a shakujo (Buddhist staff) and received by Fudo Myo-o. The second month is described in medical texts as being like peach blossoms, and in Buddhist texts as being like a single-pronged vajra and received by Shakyamuni Buddha. The third month is like a three-pronged vajra and received by Manjusri Bodhisattva. The fourth month is like a five-pronged vajra and received by Samantabhadra Bodhisattva. From the fifth month, it takes on human form and is received by Jizo Bodhisattva. The sixth month corresponds to Maitreya Bodhisattva, the seventh to Yakushi Nyorai, the eighth to Kannon Bodhisattva, the ninth to Seishi Bodhisattva, and the tenth month is received by Amida Nyorai, whereupon the form of a complete human being appears.
If pregnant women have faith in the Buddha of each respective month, the child born will be without physical defects and wise. Since the form is completed in the womb from the fifth month, the maternity belt should be worn before that time.
If the maternity belt is worn, the child in the womb will not rise upward, thus preventing difficult labor.

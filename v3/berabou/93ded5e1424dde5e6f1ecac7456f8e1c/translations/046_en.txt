After two or three months without menstruation, when pregnancy is confirmed, one experiences nausea and vomiting, spitting up phlegm, being particular about food, dizziness, and alternating chills and fever. This is called "morning sickness" (oso/tsuwari). Even without taking medicine, it will heal after a month passes. Once pregnancy is definitively confirmed, prudence of mind and body is of primary importance during the ten months. Do not listen to bad things with your ears, do not see bad colors with your eyes, listen to the teachings of sages and wise men even briefly, and read books. Do not smell bad odors with your nose, do not eat bad tastes with your mouth, maintain proper deportment in standing and sitting, do not become angry or resentful about things, keep your heart honest and compassionate, and be quiet rather than noisy. When one is prudent in this way, the child born will be intelligent with deep wisdom, become a sage, and be filial to their parents.

- Creating the forehead: Large forehead, small forehead, round forehead, melon-shaped forehead, shaved forehead - all should be created according to each person's natural features, considering whether they have a large face, small face, round face, long face, or short face. The ink at the hairline should indeed be applied very lightly, like mist covering flowers on high peaks. Above the small forehead area, one should draw and then fade it away. It tends to become crooked toward the left side. The bridge of the nose should serve as the central reference line.

- Applying fresh ink to eyebrows: Like a crescent moon faintly emerging from within the mist, they should be drawn very lightly. When the ink is dark and thick, it looks vulgar, like the face of a Jizo statue. Too little looks cold and unfriendly, while upward-slanting eyebrows appear frivolous. Eyebrows should be shaped according to each person's eye area.

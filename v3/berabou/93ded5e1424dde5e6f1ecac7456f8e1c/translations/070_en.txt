1. Regarding fire adjustment: at the beginning, take it a little strong and listen to inferior incense like manaban, then when the fire balance becomes good, listen to fine incense. When the fire is strong, do not place the incense in the center of the silver plate but place it in a corner. During eji-kago, it is acceptable for the fire to be a little strong. Also, for empty burning, no silver plate is used.

It should be placed face up. Then, with the spout inserted, they drink the san-san-kudo (three-three-nine times) ritual sake. Using the cups from the cup stand, the bride drinks first. Then the man drinks from that cup. All drink three times each. For the second cup, the groom drinks first and passes it to the bride. This is also done three times each. For the third cup, the bride drinks first and the groom finishes. This is also done three times each. The above totals san-san-kudo (three-three-nine times). Then the sake server and pot should be withdrawn to the end seat. Next, zoni (New Year soup) is served. Zoni is also served to the courtesans and ladies-in-waiting. At this time, the courtesans exchange cups with each other. During the zoni, the groom should not remain at his seat.

1. Informal wedding ceremonies (so no shukugen) mostly follow the same procedure as described above. First comes the "hand-setting," second, three cups are stacked on a sanbo (offering stand) and brought out, arranged slightly differently from the hand-setting. Third comes the "passing and serving." It is served to the bride and groom, and also to the others. Two sake pourers come out to serve, sitting with the groom in front. The person handling the long-handled ladle holds the ladle while lifting the cup's sanbo, turns toward the groom, goes around, and places the cup directly in front of the bride. An attendant takes the cup, receives sake, and passes it to the bride. The bride takes it and drinks, saying "let us drink" before drinking. The long-handle bearer then goes to the lower seat, to their left. After settling below and serving, they return to their left in the same manner, serve the third time, then carry that cup to the groom, the groom drinks, and again the long-handle bearer serves as before.

The above are formulas for kake-kō (scenting incense). There are others besides these, but I have recorded only the particularly excellent famous formulas. Kake-kō with abundant cloves and nardostachys has a superior fragrance.

Kake-kō containing kyara is of good quality. Generally speaking, no fragrance surpasses kyara. It is best to place kake-kō between folded kosode (kimono) and hang them on clothing racks. In the hot summer season, overly strong kake-kō fragrance is vulgar. Transferring the scent of takimono (burning incense) to kosode is even more base. For empty burning, takimono is good. Both kosode and katabira (summer kimono) should be scented with kyara. It is better to wear garments and scent them on the body rather than placing them over fuse-kō (covered incense). To scent new kosode, one must place thick hot water in between, or the fragrance will not transfer. Fire control is crucial. Keep the fire gentle so that the ash does not turn black, and do not let the fire die out completely.

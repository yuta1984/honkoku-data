- Medicine for hair growth in bald or thin areas:
　　Fine hair　belly　pine resin　mouse droppings　thin cord
　　Grind the above ingredients well into powder and mix with sesame oil before applying.

- Regarding hair styling methods: Hyogo, fukiage, tsunokuri (horn-shaped topknot), wakegami, guruguru, marumage (round topknot), gotan-wake, sagegami, kōgai-mage, ōshimada, and the currently popular yatsushi shimada. While there are various other styling methods, the upper classes wear sagegami, townspeople in both Kyoto and the countryside wear shimada and kōgai-wake - these two styles. From high-ranking ladies to servant girls, everyone has been wearing these styles for the past seventy to eighty years. The wakizume yatsushi shimada looks youthful and eye-catching, while the kōgai-wake with long sleeves appears mature and unpleasant, so each should be styled appropriately. Both shimada and kōgai styles that are too high look countrified. One should consider the proper proportion, like peony flowers arranged in a vase within a hedge - neither too high nor too low. Front hair that is parted high and wide is ugly. Temples (bin) that are pushed out too much look unsightly, like wearing a bird's helmet. Trimming the temples when they are growing thick is old-fashioned. It is better to let them grow and sweep them up with bin-tsuke (pomade). Shaving the hairline at the nape is very improper. It is also unpleasant to see thick white powder applied over the shaved area. Plucking the hairline in neat waves also looks unnatural, like looking at a doll's neck. One should pluck roughly so it doesn't stand out.

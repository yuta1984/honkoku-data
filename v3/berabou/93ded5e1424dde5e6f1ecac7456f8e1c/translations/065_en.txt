I too cried like a deer and was loved by someone
　　　　Now I can only hear that voice from afar

When the man heard this poem from behind cover, he was deeply moved with compassion, and thereafter stopped his visits to the other woman and spoke tenderly with his original wife. Also, during Yoritomo's time, a court lady broke off cherry blossoms from the roadside and had a young girl carry them as she passed by the gate. When Yoritomo saw this, he sent through a retainer the poem:

　　　　Cherry blossoms picked completely bare
　　　　What shall we gaze upon when spring comes again?

The woman immediately replied with this poem:

　　　　In this world where we cannot wait for the next breath after exhaling
　　　　It is only because we trust that spring will come again

Yoritomo found this elegant and ordered that her residence be investigated. It turned out she was the wife of Kajiwara Genta Saemon. Later, when relatives came and Kajiwara attempted to divorce this wife, Yoritomo heard of it and declared "The court lady who replied about the cherry blossoms must not be divorced," so Kajiwara abandoned his intention.

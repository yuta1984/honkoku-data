For underarm odor:
Take pond snails, knead a little croton seed powder into their mouths, and
they will foam. Then pluck the underarm hair, wash well, and
apply the foam from the pond snails, which will cause festering and pain. While it hurts,
leave it as is for any number of days, and when it becomes itchy, wash it off with hot water,
then apply a powder made from alum (large amount), light powder (medium), and deer antler (small amount).

scraping lightly, and applying copper coin dust powder dissolved in vinegar
is also an excellent medicine.

People throughout the land revere and honor women, for women are descendants of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess). Not only in the age of the gods, but even when the human world began, women of ancient times had honest hearts that were not wicked. However, as the world has declined to the present age, women's hearts have become worse day by day - they envy and are jealous of others, are proud of themselves, use deep cosmetics to deceive and adorn themselves, increase their greed, lack gentle hearts, and know nothing of compassion. Women are messengers of hell who cut off the seeds of Buddha; their outward appearance resembles bodhisattvas but their inner hearts are like demons, as Buddha taught in the sutras. Confucius also stated in the Analects that women become insolent when approached closely. Since women's hearts have been biased since ancient times in China and India, how could women be righteous in this degenerate age? However, if people make an effort to cultivate themselves, their hearts will become somewhat honest and will accord with the divine will of honesty. When the heart is honest, even without conscious effort, there will be no jealousy, little greed, deep compassion, pity for things, and the heart will become gentle. Women, when young and not yet married, feel shame before the world and about themselves and do not speak out, and there are places where they cultivate their hearts. But after they age and establish households, most become evil-hearted and earn nicknames like "snake" or "rokurokubi" (long-necked demon). Among the lower classes, they are called "mountain gods" by their husbands and "demons" by others - there are many such cases. This is truly deplorable. You should cultivate yourselves.

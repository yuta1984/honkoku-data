　　　　㊃On Playing the Koto
The shamisen was brought to our country from the Ryūkyū Kingdom, but its sound is lascivious and is not included among proper musical instruments, having become the trade of courtesans. You should absolutely never learn to play it. However, you should remember the names of its various parts:
　One tō (neck)　One saho (neck/rod)　One kairōbi (tailpiece) 《The curved part at the top of the neck, so called because it resembles a kōgai (hairpin)》
　One itokuchi (string aperture) 《The interior where strings are wound》　One tenju (tuning peg) 《The comb for winding strings》　　One neko (cat tail) 《The place where strings are tied, done with twisted paper, mizuhiki cord, etc.》
　One saru-o (monkey tail) 《Hooking the cat tail to the tip of the large neck》　　One chibukuro (chin bag) 《The swollen part below the neck》　One koma (bridge) and bachi (plectrum)

In the spring of New Year's gifts, rising from the east of sixteen Musashino fields, traveling along the road to Kyoto, in the hundred-palace of poem cards too, welcoming the red-painted first sunrise, and on Mount Hakoya of the ten-thousand-year fans too, on the morning when purple leather draws the dew, facing the entire body of the pillar calendar, making the New Year's day lilies laugh - there is nothing that surpasses this playful act.

Therefore, threading beautiful words with five-colored thread, adding amusing verses to colored toothpicks, the people who sing the thirty-one syllables of yuzu mochi, passing through the gate pine of my Kyōkadō, what is written with a shell ladle at the edge of the New Year's greeting register, rolled up together with mouse paper in a box of Omuro tea bowls - this too is fresh. Tying the grass knots of popular books, naming it "New Year's Greetings: A Hundred Poems by Dolts," this is what I offer in response to inquiring friends.

【Handwritten in ink】
How lovely the color and fragrance of flowers, the plum in the pot
Looking around, the world is abundant too
The color of rice
Growing more each year
Sumida's flowers
In full bloom

Drawing a tiger that resembles a cat - this is due to the painter's lack of skill. Writing "moon" but reading it as "sun" - this happens because Chinese calligraphy styles are not commonly used. Though the forms may appear the same, their essential qualities differ greatly.

Here, the author Kugutsu-shi has drawn warrior pictures, selecting those whose forms are similar, and calls this work "Warrior Competition Tengu Haikai." He is naturally arrogant and his nose is extremely high. Therefore, he has added both old and new haiku verses and requests that I evaluate them. This too is like drawing a tiger that resembles a cat, or cutting off horns and killing an ox - such is the nature of this work, which I present as this preface.

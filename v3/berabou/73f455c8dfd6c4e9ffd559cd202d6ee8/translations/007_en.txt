Title: Prohibition Notice

○Left: Tsuna
From the second floor—
"No urinating"
Willow tree
　　　　Kugutsu-shi

Commentary:
Even the neck guard hood feels guilty. At the urinal
by Rashomon riverbank. Pulled up
by something with hands, and thus meeting unexpectedly on Mount Kozan.
Sake in a tea bowl with a demon's grilled head. To deal with
a demon's wife, one must push through with demonic force.

○Right: Benkei
Even Saigyo
has not yet seen
these flowers of the pleasure quarter
　　　　　Kyoden

Commentary:
"Customers staying overnight not served"—
the prohibition notice
hung on the wall. The flowers of the quarter
that won't let you carelessly pluck them.
In the sewing room
with Benkei-striped fabric. Fearing
the first bedding of Konan,
if you cut one branch, you should cut one finger.

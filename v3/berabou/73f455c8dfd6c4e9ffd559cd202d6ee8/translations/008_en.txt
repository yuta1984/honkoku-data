Title: Naginata (Halberd)

○Left: Kumasaka
　　　　　　　　Ryōta
In the May rains—
　one night
secretly
　the moon through pines

Commentary:
His heart is like a wolf,
his techniques resemble a fox. Sometimes
dwelling in holes, sometimes climbing trees.
Kumasaka's crescent-moon naginata. To try to get
people's wealth into one's palm is truly
having a human face but a beast's heart.

○Right: Tomomori
　　　　　　　　　　Gazan
Into the rough sea's
　depths it has entered—
　　the three-day moon

Commentary:
Sinking in the abyss of debt,
those wave-coins of brass—
the penniless Counselor
of the Heike side, this pledge's
backing is also that of a naginata-bearing
masterless samurai, perhaps.

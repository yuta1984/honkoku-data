The land of Ezo does not normally produce the five grains, but the interior of Ezo particularly lacks these. The only things available are kelp, herring roe, and fish. Since Yoshitsune's provisions brought from the settled lands were running low, he caught fish to supplement their rations. In particular, they caught crucian carp, made dried grilled carp for storage, and when washing rice, they saved an enormous amount of white starchy water.

"Grilled carp is delicious, but I don't know what this white water will be used for. I've heard that wives often want this stuff."

"Lord Kamei's roasting pan is quite intense."

"Day after day, I've grown tired of grilling carp."

"If you're going to grill carp, Kasuga Mountain is also near the river."

【From here begins the middle volume】
Lord Yoshitsune advances toward the castle of the great king, chief of the interior Ezo tribe "Intsuu-futtewesu." The castle has stone walls built ten fathoms high, with dried kelp and seaweed stalks hardened and used as defensive spikes. When they attacked the vulnerable spots by mixing returned earth with the white starchy water they had saved beforehand and shooting it with water guns, the defenses immediately became soft. Then they shot soy sauce from behind, and having devoured everything completely, they charged in with a battle cry.

"I wondered what the white water would be used for, but indeed, our lord's wisdom is exceptional!"

"Bravo! Praise it like 'Tamaya!'"

[Sign] Kelp and Herring Roe Exchange Office

A kelp and herring roe exchange office was established, and by virtue of Lord Yoshitsune's authority, this was proclaimed throughout the land. Since trading seaweed, sagara seaweed, and small dried sardines was not disagreeable, people from all over Ezo brought kelp and herring roe daily without interruption to exchange them.

[Dialogue of Ezo people]
"This kelp has some tears in it, but couldn't you give me something extra? It's from Konbu-suke's 'nikogori' place."

"Even so, bringing one bale and getting eight bales in return seems quite profitable."

"That fellow always thinks about profit and loss."

In the first place, Ezo country excels not only in the five grains but also lacks superior textiles. Though there is something called "Ezo brocade," this too comes from Beijing, and only the country's king wears it - others cannot wear it at all. Therefore, since everyone wrapped themselves in kelp, and this looked unseemly, they established clothing stores this time, creating stripes and small patterns to replace kelp, which turned out remarkably splendid.

"Since it was proclaimed that all of Ezo should follow Japanese customs, Ezo's 808 districts were opened up and became extraordinarily prosperous."

"This is not an imitation. It really looks like kelp. Children, serve tea!"

"This is called 'success small pattern' and is extremely popular."

"Don't you have small patterns like Kyōden's fine small patterns?"

"Since this is a gift for the inspection officials, show them good quality kelp even if it's expensive. That's probably an imitation from Jōshū province - isn't that just seaweed?"

Tankan (an Ezo person's name) claimed it was for Yoshitsune's official use and exchanged and collected all the kelp, herring roe, seaweed, sagara seaweed, and small dried sardines from throughout Ezo.

"Put sugar on thick rice cakes and store them in your belly" - what a clever thing to say!

"Our kelp and herring roe that were taken must be in there too."
"There it is, hen-hen toko-hen" [Ezo lamentation sounds].

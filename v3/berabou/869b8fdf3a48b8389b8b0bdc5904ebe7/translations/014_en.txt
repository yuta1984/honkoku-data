Beyond the 808 districts of Ezo, they cleared the seaside areas overgrown with reeds and established a pleasure quarter called "Shin-Ashihara" (New Reed Plain), modeled after Japan's Yoshiwara. Following Yoshitsune's military methods, they divided the town into sections of 5x5 = 25 districts each, and named the main gate "Enmon-guchi" (Camp Gate), which was like reciting poems about departing for the frontier. Since this was unprecedented in Ezo, it was extraordinarily prosperous with never a shortage of customers. However, since there was no gold or silver at all and kelp and herring roe were used instead, the wealthy Ezo people would load kelp and herring roe into four-bearer palanquins and live in great luxury.

"Tankan kakerai In-worisuu uramin te-eru" [Ezo language]

Both men became great kelp magnates through dealings with Ezo merchants and frequented Ashihara day and night for pleasure. However, they didn't spend their good kelp and herring roe, but instead brought only seaweed and small dried sardines in palanquins, scattered them about, received genuine kelp and herring roe from the official inspectors, and ultimately took change before returning home. This is what "fishing for sea bream in Ezo" means.

"Packaged seaweed and small sardines are bulky and troublesome. This is like Japan's southern territories."

"In-worisuu is also coming, so let's head home early tonight."

"Well, well, what an honor to have you visit! Mountain kite of gratitude, though it's awkward with Katsuhara Yoshitsune here. Please kindly mediate our private request, heh heh heh."

"It's certainly something that would be quite difficult to accomplish elsewhere."

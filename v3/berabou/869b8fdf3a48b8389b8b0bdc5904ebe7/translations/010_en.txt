All the Ezo people became like kelp rolls, were picked up and cut with chopsticks, and were defeated, with all of them surrendering completely.

The chieftain-king was a queen with a daughter named "Kairai-kōshu" and "Ayafuya-fujin," who was said to be beautiful in appearance. Therefore, Yoshitsune was greatly pleased, saying, "I have seen court performances in the capital, but there is no such beauty as this." When the great king recommended that he take her daughter and become the lord of the Ezo, he was naturally inclined to accept. They chose an auspicious day, arranged the marriage, and consummated their vows within kelp bedding.

The mother, the chieftain-king, also became envious and chose Musashibō (Benkei), secretly having intimate relations with him in private. The saying that Benkei "gave up after just one time" is a complete lie.

In Kannon-chō it would be "Atago's barrier," but in Anjin-chō it feels like "buying a naked bikuni (Buddhist nun)."

The kelp comforter is thick and heavy; let's dye rough seaweed in a dappled pattern.

At Yoshitsune's celebratory banquet, Kamei, Kataoka, Ise, and Suruga each decided to pair up with court ladies of their choosing.

"Let's drink up. Oh, how amusing! Well then, you're amusing too!"

This is not a Japanese product
but is said to come from foreign countries
It began with what the Dutch brought over
The manufacturing technique is extremely refined
In the medieval period and after, people learned to manufacture this
in Nagasaki and transmitted the craft to the Sakaba district in Kyoto
where there are those who practice this trade. Recently
this profession is practiced in Edo, with many varieties
and implements for tea ceremony that are exquisitely made
Truly, in this era when all under heaven is peacefully governed,
the benevolent influence of our sovereign overflows, and even such
products from foreign lands
gather here without exception—
is this not a blessed and sacred age?

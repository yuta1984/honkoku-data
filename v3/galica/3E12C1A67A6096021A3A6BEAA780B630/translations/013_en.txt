From then on, the craft was passed down through generations, and there is no end to counting the famous regional products such as danshi and hōsho paper as superior goods.

In Kyoto, there is the flow of the Kamiya River where this profession is practiced. In Edo, in places like Azabu, Sekiguchi, or Imado and Sanya, on evenings of divine storms, the somehow lonely sound of fulling blocks can be heard distantly regardless of season, which is particularly deeply melancholic.

Beginning with Tao-shi of the Zhou dynasty in China, this craft arose in our country during the reign of Emperor Sujin. During the reign of Emperor Monmu, there was a swordsmith named Amakuni who split the double edge of a sword in two, and this came to be called a "katana" (sword). Since then, this tradition has been passed down through generations, and there are excellent craftsmen in various provinces. Starting with the master smith Kokaji Munechika, there are so many that no number of fingers would suffice to count them all.

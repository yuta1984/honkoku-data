Tatami (woven straw mats)
According to the Honchō-shiki (National Regulations), the Kambe-ryō (Bureau of Palace Attendants) specifies
long tatami and short tatami as follows:

The imperial tatami of the forbidden palace:
　　length seven shaku, thickness two sun and two bu
For the three highest ministers and monastic temples:
　　length six shaku and six sun, thickness one sun and eight bu
　Mount Yoshino and Mount Kōya also use these measurements
　Therefore these are called Kōya-ma (Kōya spacing)

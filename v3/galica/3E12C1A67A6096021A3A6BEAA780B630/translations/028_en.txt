Kyōshi (sutra copyist/mounter)

[Left page]
The kyōshi creates
sutras used in Buddhism.
Those who engage in this
craft are skilled in paper work
for this purpose.
Therefore, from mounting work or folding screens,
sliding doors, to colored paper
and poetry cards,
they have come to also
engage in these trades.
In reality, kyōshi, mounting specialists,
and pasting craftsmen
should be
distinct occupations.

that you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers. When brothers came and bore witness in truth, saying that you practice the truth,
I rejoiced greatly. There is no greater joy than hearing that my own children walk in truth. Beloved, you act faithfully
toward the brothers and toward strangers as well. Especially before the inn, those people showed your kindness. You do well to
send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God, doing good work. Those people went out for the sake of my name, receiving nothing from the Gentiles. Such

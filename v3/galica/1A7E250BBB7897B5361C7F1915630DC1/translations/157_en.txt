He hears us. We know that whatever we ask, He hears. We know that we receive what we have asked of Him. If someone sees a brother committing a sin that does not lead to death, let him pray for that person who commits sins that do not defile the pure brethren. He will give life to those who have committed sins that do not lead to death. I do not say that one should pray about sin that leads to death. All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that leads to death.

We know that anyone born of God does not commit sin. However, the one born of heaven guards himself, and the evil one cannot touch people. We know that we come from heaven. The world is evil everywhere. We know that the Son of God has given us understanding so that we may know the true God. We are in the true God, in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. Children, guard against idols

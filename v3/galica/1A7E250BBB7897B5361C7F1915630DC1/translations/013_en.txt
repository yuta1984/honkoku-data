The Gospel of John　The Message of John　Joy

In the beginning was the Word. This Word was with God. This Word was God.
In the beginning this Word was with God. All things were made through him. Not one thing was made
without being made through him. In him was life, and this life was the light of mankind. This light shines in the darkness.
But the dark people of the world did not understand it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
This man came to bear witness, to bear witness about the light, so that all people might believe through him. This man was not the light,
but came only to bear witness about the light. This true light illuminates all people who come into the world.

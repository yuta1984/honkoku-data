Had something happened? He had made a personal vow that he would cast his net no more than four times in a single day. Thus, one day, as usual, he left home in the early morning and rowed his boat out into the waves using the moon as his light. After casting his net three times, each time it pulled so heavily that his hands could barely bear it, and it was so heavy it seemed the net might break. Though he had not caught thousands of fish, thinking he would not let even a few large fish escape, his heart was joyful as he somehow managed to pull up the nets. In the first net, he pulled up the large, already rotting carcass of a donkey. Next, he pulled up a horse basket filled with sand and mud. And then, he pulled up an enormous amount of shells, stones, mud, and the like.

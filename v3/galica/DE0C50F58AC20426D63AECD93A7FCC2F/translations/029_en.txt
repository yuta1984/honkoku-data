flash mirrors with candlelight around the bird cage, continuing this from evening until dawn. Then the next day, the wealthy merchant returned home and again asked the parrot, "Did anything happen last night?" The parrot replied that there had been frequent thunder, lightning, and torrential rain, and that it had been extremely distressed. Based on this, the merchant no longer trusted the parrot's words, thinking "Its telling me about my wife must also have come from its nonsensical chatter." He immediately flew into a great rage and, taking the innocent parrot from its cage, hurled it with all his strength onto the floorboards. Pitiably, it died instantly. Afterward, the wealthy merchant learned that the parrot had been falsely accused and greatly regretted his actions.

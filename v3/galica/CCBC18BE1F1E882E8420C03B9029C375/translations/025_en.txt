Tsubo Daijin (Lord of the Vulva) - The Mast of a Ship Bound for Tang China

【Main Text】
This implement belongs to Tsubo Daijin, who when crossing over with his vermillion long penis and male organ, departed from Naniwa Bay and erected this mast while gazing far upon the shellfish gathering of the ama divers. The vermillion long penis refers to the male organ, also called "vulva long stem," and when he was about to return to Japan, he saw the vulva of an older woman and composed a foolish 31-syllable poem: "That woman's belly, when I see her vulva tip, it throbs - like the gap from which mucus flows." When he showed this to the men with penises, all the people of that country became offended. Tsubo Daijin is the founder of all various arts of this country, and his extensive knowledge of erotic studies is widely known among all people.

"When looking at female genitalia, the penis becomes erect and troublesome, so that's probably why they say 'almost-seen trouble.' Without hands, if the hole were Lake Biwa, then the rod would be Chikubushima Island."

"Come now, look plenty, look well! But just looking is no good. Listen, later please do it with all your might. I intend to exert myself so much my hips give out and collapse."

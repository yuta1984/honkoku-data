The Japanese Pepper Grinding Stick Held by "Otake Daibecho Nyorai" (Buddha)

【Main Text】
This is the grinding stick familiar to the hands of Otake Daibecho Nyorai, made from Japanese pepper obtained from the waters of southern Boso Peninsula. Its head is large and base narrow, and the joints within the bark resemble the warts on the Buddha's head. What wraps around from base to tip like the veins of water shield resembles the traces of intertwined ivy and vines. This Buddha possesses infinite compassion, so even those who are extremely lustful, mad, or senile, when they cling to his sleeves and pray solely for rebirth in paradise, he has vowed to nod his head vertically. Those who share in his lustful heart will greatly become aroused for the sake of the sacred opening and engage in night crawling.

"This one is wonderfully, wonderfully wonderful - what a good old woman, they say with conviction. Hey wonderful old woman, rejoice! When pressed, it rises and stands! What a clever pun this is!"

"Mumble mumble, munch munch, fumble fumble... Ah, if you pinch this edge like that, it hurts!" - this seems to refer to eating or drinking around the intimate parts.

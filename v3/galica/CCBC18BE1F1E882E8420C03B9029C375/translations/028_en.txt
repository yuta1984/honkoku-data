**Illustration of the Master of Musical Pleasure**

【Main Text】
The Master of Musical Pleasure is at the knee-thighs of the Tathagata of the Wife's Chamber Without Attachment, within the beautiful opening of passionate love. The fools of all ten directions, the long and short hakama of black and white, reside here. When the Jade Stem Kannon enters and exits this beautiful opening, the jade gate bodhisattva takes the rhythm and emits sounds of playing music, moving the buttocks left and right in a whirling dance. The three futons in the sitting circle are warm, and the pillow at the bottom of the ship indicates the appointed time for all matters. The bird of word-play chirps in the breathing of flowers, and the shell of the tea mortar sinks in the waves of lustful water. Getting on all fours and joining together, the jade stem of aroused lustful heart shall be thrust in deeply to the root.

"The technique of the well-practiced private parts, soft as foam, is this. Please try it with the foundation of secret pleasure made familiar."

"When the pillow shifts, it's no time for musical pleasure. It's like being caught in a hell-drop, so be careful and use your hips gently and slowly."

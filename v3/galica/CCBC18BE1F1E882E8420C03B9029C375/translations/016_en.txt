【Title】Created by the High Priest Bōnen
The Sacred Image of the Three-Inch Useless Fool

【Small text】My penis is just like that taro over there, so I'll peel off the foreskin and let you eat it. I'm not bragging, but it tastes different from other penises. That's what I think. Anyway, please try eating it first. I won't cause you trouble.

【Main text】Now, this three-inch sacred image of the useless fool enshrined here is among the hundred specialty Buddhist images of the half-peeled tradition, one of the sixteen phallic saints of the Buddha from the country of Tenjiku Inmonra. The Venerable Mokuren took wood from a foreskin-covered penis with his own hands, and carved it with a small golden rod while the penis was still small. This sacred image, made in the same form, wrapped around the shaft and body with an upward curve, is the creation of the High Priest Bōnen when he was sixteen years old, a sacred body bestowed upon the master of the endless hell. The fact that the head curves to the left is said to manifest the lustful thoughts that later became the treasured possession of the playful Kaimyōjin. How much can the deeply faithful ladies insert to achieve their heart's desire?

【Small text】Since it's called a "foreskin that avoids public eye," for secret lovemaking, only a penis like yours will do. Please thrust and rotate it with feeling. If you do that, I'll give you my passionate energy. Hurry up and push! Hah, hah, hah!

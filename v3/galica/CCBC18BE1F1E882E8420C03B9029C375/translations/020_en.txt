Reverently enshrined here is the sacred image of Sake-Phallus Tathagata with Eight-Inch Torso Reversal, which forms a pair with Octopus Medicine Buddha and Hot-Water Vulva Bodhisattva, and is the spiritual body of one born unopened. During the honored time of Spring Three Times Six, at the Cold Sake Ship in the Heavenly Tianzhu Country, a Vulva Banquet was held, gathering the callous-hearted from the three thousand worlds for sexual union, and it was proclaimed: "The immeasurable pleasure of our staff lies in the truth that comes after two years of being uncircumcised." Thus, this Sake-Phallus Tathagata remained with foreskin covering until the age of forty-two. Those of the lecherous kidney enter deeply to achieve beautiful pleasure, and should offer up the paper for wiping the sacred grime, wet and slippery, from time to time.

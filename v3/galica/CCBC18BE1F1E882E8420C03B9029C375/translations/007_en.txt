Preface
Eating coarse food and drinking water, bending one's elbow to use as a pillow. Joy is also found therein—
Imitating Gankai (Yan Hui), while twisting a troublesome stick, dozing off leaning against a desk.
Upon hearing that the itinerant Buddha statue would pass over the floating bridge of his afternoon nap dream, with his usual haste,
he thrust out his half-shrunken, half-erect "pine mushroom" without even tucking it into his sash, and ran bow-legged to the site, only to find that the sacred statue had already been put away in its portable shrine. Thinking he might as well worship at the direct exhibition as consolation, he first pushed into the offering hall, lay on his back, somehow slurping his drool, and looking up, saw some kind of Buddha—a strangely shaped sacred body.

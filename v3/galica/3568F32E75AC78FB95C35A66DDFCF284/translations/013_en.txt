That area was wet as if something had spilled, making squishy sounds each time they moved their hips. Orihei said this was the first time he had encountered such a high-class woman, and the pleasure of being enveloped by her was indescribable. After moving vigorously about three times, they were startled by the sound of people approaching. They tried to get up quickly, but she was so exhausted from the intense experience that her hips and knees wouldn't support her, so he had to carry her on his back to Okawa Bridge where there would be palanquins available.

This charming man, overflowing with appeal, would spread out his cloth bundles in the dim areas of the御広敷 (go-hiroshiki), saying "The crimson silk order for Ikuyo-sama and the dyed goods for Murase-sama are ready," and while cleaning up, a middle-ranking lady attendant—around twenty years old, perhaps one or two years older, a woman of such stunning beauty that it was almost shocking—had apparently developed some kind of relationship with him, and was watching for opportunities when no one was looking.

This morning, he beautified himself and, thinking that he would soon die, composed a poem and brought it with him. The poem was:

Burning endlessly with limitless longing for the fire-rat robe,
Even my sleeves have dried—today I shall finally wear it.

He brought it to the gate of the house and placed it there. The Bamboo Cutter came out, took it inside, and showed it to Princess Kaguya. Upon seeing the fire-rat robe, Princess Kaguya said, "It appears to be a beautiful robe. However, I cannot tell whether it is truly a genuine fire-rat robe." The Bamboo Cutter replied, "In any case, let us first present it to the Lesser Captain. Since it appears to be a fire-rat robe the likes of which has never been seen in this world, I think we should offer this to him."

dispatched them. Arriving at the house, they positioned a thousand men on the ground and a thousand men on the roof. Since there were also many people of the household, combined together they guarded without leaving any gaps. These guards also bore bows and arrows, and inside the main house, women stood watch and guarded. The ladies-in-waiting carefully protected Princess Kaguya inside the painted chamber, and the old man also barred the door of the painted chamber and stationed himself at the entrance. The old man said: "In a place guarded so thoroughly as this, could we possibly lose to the heavenly beings?" Speaking to the people on the roof, he said: "If even the slightest suspicious thing should fly about in the sky, immediately shoot it dead." The guards said: "In a place guarded so strictly as this, even if so much as a single bat should appear, we will first shoot it dead and expose it outside."

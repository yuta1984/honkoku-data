When [Kuratsu-maro] reported that there was nothing there, the Middle Counselor became angry, saying "Did you not search properly?" and "What would people think of me?" He declared, "I shall climb up and search myself," and getting into the basket, was hoisted up to peer [into the nest]. As the swallows spread their tails and fluttered about frantically, he raised his hand in sync with their movement to search, and when something glittering touched his hand, he exclaimed, "I have grasped my prize! Lower me now! I have accomplished a great feat!" As everyone gathered to quickly lower him, they pulled the rope too forcefully, and the moment the rope went slack, he fell backwards onto the Yashima cauldrons. The people were utterly dismayed and rushed to support him. His eyes had rolled back showing only the whites.

"Is it true that you are suffering such heartache and worry?" he said. The bamboo cutter, weeping, replied: "On this fifteenth day, messengers from the capital of the moon will come to fetch Princess Kaguya. Since you have honored us with your august words, on this fifteenth day, please grant us people. When the people from the moon capital come, we shall have them captured." The imperial messenger returned and reported on the old man's condition, relating these matters that had been spoken. Hearing this, [the Emperor] said: "Even having seen her but once, We cannot forget her in Our heart—how could We bear to think of losing Princess Kaguya, whom We have grown accustomed to seeing morning and evening?" On that fifteenth day, he commanded the various government offices, appointed Imperial Messenger Lesser Captain Takano no Ōkuni, and [sent] a combined total of two thousand men from the Six Guard Offices to the bamboo cutter's house.

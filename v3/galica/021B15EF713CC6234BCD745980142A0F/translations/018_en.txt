So saying, she threw the returned bowl out at the gate and composed this reply poem:

"When I meet Mount Shirayama, does its light fade away? Even throwing away the bowl, I still find it unreliable"

She sang this and went inside. Princess Kaguya made no reply poem. Since she didn't even listen, he struggled to find words and returned home. Because he threw away that bowl and spoke again, worthless things came to be called "throwing away bowls" (a failure).

Prince Kuramoto was a person of great cunning. To the court he said "I shall go to bathe in the hot springs of Tsukushi Province" and requested leave, while to Princess Kaguya's household he had it announced that "he goes to obtain the jeweled branch," and so he departed with his retainers serving him.

At the house, the prince who had come to visit said, "I have risked my life to obtain that jeweled branch," and requested to show it to Princess Kaguya. The old man brought it in. A letter was attached to this jeweled branch.

　　Even if I should perish uselessly,
　　I would break off this jeweled branch and never return again

While she was looking at this with pity, the bamboo cutter came running in and said, "This prince has brought exactly the jeweled branch from Mount Horai that he promised, without a single detail wrong. What can I say? He has come here still in his traveling clothes, without even stopping at his own home."

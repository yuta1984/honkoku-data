In trying to obtain that jewel, so many people were about to be killed. Moreover, if you had captured the dragon, I too would have been killed without incident. It is fortunate that you did not capture it. That great thief Kaguya-hime was trying to have people killed. Do not even let anyone pass near the house now. Do not let the men walk about either." So saying, he gave what little property remained in the house to those who had not obtained the dragon's jewel. Hearing this, they departed.

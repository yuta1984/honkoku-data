Arqan fell ill during the march. The military council of Fan Wenhu and others was divided in opinion, making it impossible to reach a decision. In the seventh month, all the Mongol warships arrived at Japanese islands and moved from there to Mount Goryū. When the Kyushu warriors were preparing to engage them in battle, a great wind blew on the first day of the eighth month, completely destroying the Mongol ships. The various generals including Fan Wenhu boarded the better ships and fled to unknown destinations, while the troops drifted to the base of Mount Goryū. Having no provisions, they went without food or drink for three days. After consulting together, they made a man called Zhang Baihu their commander and attempted to repair their ships. On the seventh day of the same month, Japanese forces attacked them. The Mongols were defeated in battle with many killed. The remaining 30,000 survivors were taken alive by the Japanese forces and all beheaded at Hakkaku Island. Among them were men named Gan Shang, Mo Qing, Wu, and others.

In the first month of the second year, Shogun Minamoto no Koreyasu was promoted to the Senior Second Rank.

In the second month of the third year, the Mongol envoy Du Shizhong was killed. Perhaps because news of this spread, rumors were heard that Mongol generals were planning to destroy Japan with large armies. Consequently, the imperial court dispatched imperial messengers to Ise, and prayers were offered at various temples and shrines. While Hōjō Tokimune remained in Kamakura, he commanded the warriors of Kyushu to prepare for defense. He also sent many troops from the Kantō region to the capital to protect the Emperor and Crown Prince, and it was decided that the Retired Emperor (Go-Fukakusa) and New Retired Emperor (Kameyama) should travel to the Kantō region. Furthermore, orders were given that depending on the situation in Kyushu, troops from both Rokuhara offices should proceed to western Kyushu.

In the first month of the fourth year, four Mongol generals - Arqan, Fan Wenhu, Xin Du, and Hong Chaqiu - appeared on the seas leading 100,000 men in 60,000 warships.

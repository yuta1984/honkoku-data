They were captured and sent down to Kamakura. This was because they had received imperial edicts to subjugate the military government through prayers and incantations. All were exiled to distant places. Hino Suketomo, who was at his place of exile in Sado, was killed by a warrior named Honma who received orders from Takatoki. Suketomo's son, a child called Ashin, killed Honma, thus avenging his father. In the sixth month, Hōjō Shigetoki was appointed as shikken (regent). He was the son of Hirotoki. In the seventh month, Hino Toshimoto was again summoned to Kamakura and killed. This was because both Suketomo and Toshimoto were particularly involved in secret plotting.

In the eighth month, Konoe Tsunetada resigned from the position of kanpaku (regent). Takatsukasa Fuyunori became kanpaku. In the ninth month, because Nagasaki Takasuke wielded excessive tyrannical power, Takatoki secretly ordered Takayori, a member of Takasuke's clan, to kill Takasuke. When the matter became known, Takayori was instead exiled to Mutsu Province, and Takasuke became even more arrogant. Kamakura's government fell into disorder and all the people turned against it. Hearing this, the Emperor again plotted against Kamakura.

The clan and their allies, including Mōri Saiga and Seki Masayasu, totaling over 270 people, sat in a row before the portrait of Yoritomo and committed suicide. Over 500 retainers also all died. The remaining partisans were all killed in various places. Tokiyori reported this matter to Kyoto and had Shigeto ki communicate it to Saionji Saneuji. Around this time, Dōke had secretly made agreements with Mitsumura regarding the former shogun Yoritsune's journey to the capital, which caused friction with the Kantō region. Since Saneuji increasingly deepened his relations with the Hōjō, the Saionji family's influence became preeminent among the seiga families, and they began to look down upon the regent families (sesshō-ke). In the seventh month, Hōjō Sagami-no-kami Shigeto ki returned from Rokuhara to Kamakura at Tokiyori's invitation. Tokiyori immediately consulted on various matters, and they became co-regents (rensho and ryō-shikken). Shigeto ki changed his title from Sagami-no-kami to Mutsu-no-kami, while Tokiyori took the title of Sagami-no-kami. Shigeto ki's eldest son Nagato ki was stationed at Rokuhara to oversee the administration of the Kinai and western provinces.

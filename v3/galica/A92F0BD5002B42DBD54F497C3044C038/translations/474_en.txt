Minister Sanetsune became regent. This was the first time for the Ichijō house. In the third month, Saneuji was appointed Minister of the Left and Right (Daijō-daijin). In the same month, former Counselor Sugawara no Tamenaga died at age eighty-nine.

In the fourth month, Hōjō Tsunetoki fell ill and yielded his position to his younger brother, Assistant Captain of the Left Tokiyori. In the fourth month, Tsunetoki took Buddhist vows. On the first day of the intercalary fourth month, Tsunetoki died at age thirty-three. He had been regent from the third year of Ninji until this year, a mere five years.

In the fifth month, the Kamakura Disturbance occurred. There was a man named Hōjō Echigo no kami Mitsutoki, who was either a son of Yoshitoki or Tokitoki. He had served close to Yoritsune and plotted to kill Tokiyori and become regent himself. This was immediately exposed, and Mitsutoki had his lands confiscated and was exiled to Izu. His kinsmen were all sentenced to exile. Mitsutoki's younger brother Tokiaki and others, having no treasonous intent, continued the Nagoe house. From this time, Tokiyori finally seized control of the realm and supported Shogun Yoritsugu. In the sixth month, Yoritsune left Eichū and took residence at the Sasuke mansion of Hōjō Tokimori.

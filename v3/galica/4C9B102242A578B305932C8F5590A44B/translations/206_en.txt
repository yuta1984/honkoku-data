　Number Two

Occasional Verse in Leisure from Zen Practice
　The white shrine welcomes spring, dividing the surface of the world—how could it be
　Merely prohibiting wine and avoiding pungent vegetables? The temple bell
　Shakes the earth and awakens dark dreams; the Buddha-sun
　Rises to heaven and dispels the dim mists. Though the warbler flowing through bamboo
　Calls to its friend, the crane dancing at cloud's edge
　Circles apart from its flock. Upon the incense altar, inscribing a new
　Verse, I suddenly see blue smoke forming seal-script characters.

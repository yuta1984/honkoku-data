When Lord Oda Nobunaga was young, he was unrestrained and his conduct was improper. The veteran retainer Hirate Nakatsukasa-no-taisuke Masahide remonstrated with him through written admonitions, but these were not heeded. Therefore, in the spring of Tenbun 22 (1553), Masahide committed suicide at Shiga village in Niwa District. As a result, Lord Nobunaga regretted his former errors, reformed his conduct, and commanded the monk Takugen to build Seishū-ji Temple to pray for Masahide's soul. This account appears in various historical records including "Oda Shinki," "Nobunaga-ki," and "Sōken-ki."

Ōdaka Castle Ruins (Located to the southeast of Ōdaka Village, measuring 59 ken east to west and 18 ken north to south. The site is now the residential land of the Shimizu family). Originally built by Lord Nobunaga, but his retainer Yamaguchi Samanosuke, having certain circumstances, rebelled against his lord and seized this castle through intrigue, moreover submitting to the Imagawa family. However, during the Battle of Okehazama, when the Oda forces constructed fortresses at two locations, Washizu and Marune, attempting to block and cut off the supply routes of the Imagawa forces, the Divine Lord (Tokugawa Ieyasu) at age nineteen, in his first campaign, used clever tactics to easily transport provisions to this castle—this is widely known throughout the world, so I will not record the details and omit everything here.

Washizu Fortress Ruins (Located about 8 chō to the northeast of the same village, measuring 14 ken east to west and 15 ken north to south, a fortress with earthworks on all four sides. During Imagawa Yoshimoto's campaign, Owari forces including Iio Ōminokami, his brother Iio Okinokami, and Oda Genbanosuke with 520 horsemen fortified themselves in this fortress)

Marune Fortress Ruins (Located about 4 chō north of Ōdaka, about 5 ken wider east to west than Washizu fortress, with everything else the same. During Yoshimoto's campaign, Sakuma Daigaku of Owari was stationed here when the Divine Lord launched an attack, and Daigaku was defeated and killed in battle)

Former Kampaku Senior Second Rank Naidaijin Toyotomi Hidetugi (According to the Shogun Family Genealogy: "Kampaku Naidaijin, initially became the adopted son of Miyoshi Yamashironokami, hence called Miyoshi Magoshichirō. Actually the son of Sanmi Hōin and adopted son of Hideyoshi." The "Owari Jinbutsu-shi Ryaku" states he was "born in Ōdaka Village, Chita District, father was Nagao Musashinokami Yoshifusa")

"Chūgishi Nukigaki" (Hotta Kōzukenosuke Masanobu, priest name Chūzō, at his place of exile in Shinano, Kanbun 3rd year, year of the Metal Rabbit, second month)

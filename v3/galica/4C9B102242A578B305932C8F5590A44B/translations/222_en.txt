Shōtoku-ji Temple

By Hyakuhi Dōjin
The jeweled nets shimmer in the seven-treasure forest, the dharma mirror in mid-air reflects deeply
Most pitiful is the brief clouded flower, making both visitors long witness the unstained mind

Upon viewing the treasures of Nagoya Shōtoku-ji Temple
Teiryū

Though I try to cultivate myself
　　My heart is like disheveled hair
In any case, I shall rely upon
　　The sacred mirror image

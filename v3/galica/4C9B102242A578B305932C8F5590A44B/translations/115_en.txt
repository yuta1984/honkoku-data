The Niō Gate, Five-Story Pagoda (built during the Bunsei era, housing the Aizen Myōō statue created by Kōbō Daishi as the principal image; this is an ancient statue that was formerly at Nagaoka-shō Ōsu, while the Five Wisdom Buddhas are newly carved wooden statues copied from the principal image of Shitennō-ji), the Thirty-three Kannon Hall, Dainichi Hall, Shōten Hall, and Fudō Hall (housing a miraculous Buddha statue known to the world as Kitano Fudō).

Chinju Tenmangu Shrine: This divine image was painted by Sugawara no Michizane himself at Dazaifu in Tsukushi in the second year of Engi, and sent to his wife and daughter. During the Tenryaku era, when the deity was enshrined at Kitano, it was placed in the shrine hall. Out of profound reverence, Emperor Go-Daigo had it brought to Nagaoka-shō Ōsu and established this historic shrine (it is still called Kitano-yama, and the common name "Ōsu" derives from this origin). The annual festival is held on February 25th, when temple school children offer large calligraphy characters, displaying them on the walls of the worship hall and study rooms to amaze all visitors. On this day, crowds gather along the roads for dozens of blocks from Sakura Tenmangu to this location (there is also a small shrine dedicated to the three deities of Hachiman, Ise, and Kasuga. Additionally, small shrines to Inari, Akiba, and Tennō are situated alongside. The inscription on the temple bell shows characters from the tenth year of Eikyō). Within the precincts are several theaters and sideshow booths that operate year-round.

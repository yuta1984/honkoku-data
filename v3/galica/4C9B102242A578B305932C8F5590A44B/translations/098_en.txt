《Small print: Preface to "Three Generations' Poetry Exchange"》
In the spring of the year Kōshin, envoys from Korea lodged at Seikōin in the castle town. I received orders to join in poetry composition at the Shōsō Guest Hall together with the literary official Nam Chu-wol and secretaries. Danmu Sonhiko also attended, sitting to the right. Chu-wol took up his brush and wrote "Three Generations, One Gathering." Each person exchanged beautiful poems—a rare treasure of our time. Ah, these words can be considered an imperishable glory. Therefore, I collected these poems into one volume, titled "Three Generations' Poetry Exchange," and commissioned engravers to publish it for the world. Hence I preface these words to explain their beginning.

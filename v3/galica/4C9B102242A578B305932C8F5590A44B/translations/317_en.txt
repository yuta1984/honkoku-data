Arimatsu Shibori (Tie-dyeing): This is manufactured in Arimatsu Village, where for several towns high-roofed shops line up with their eaves adjacent, decorating their storefronts with silk tie-dyed fabrics in indescribable splendor. Therefore, even in "Tōkō Wassetsu" it is noted as "beautiful cotton shops in the countryside that rival Kyoto at Arimatsu." Besides this, words of praise in writings from various houses are too numerous to enumerate. Truly, this should be called the premier specialty product of the fifty-three stations of the Tōkaidō.

Among these, the family that first began producing this tie-dyeing is called Takeda Shōkurō, and they still hold great influence today. During the Keichō era, they came here from Agui-shō in the same district and established their shop, and from then it grew to the dozens of shops we see today. This particular house is patronized not only by lords high and low, great and small, but even Dutch and Ryūkyū people stop by to purchase and appreciate these goods.

Generally speaking, what is called tie-dyeing in the world is the ancient kukuri-dyeing, and the imperial bedding of Empress Kōken preserved at Hōryū Temple in Ryūgata, Yamato Province, is called sen-dai kōketsu-dyeing. Also, Kamo no Mabuchi says in his "Shogaku" that in the commentary on Ariwara no Narihira's poem "kara-kurenai ni mizu kukuru," "autumn leaves flowing in patches with white waves intermittently rising and mixing creates the appearance of crimson kōketsu, and since this is so rare, making flowing water into kōketsu—such a thing has never been heard of since the age of the gods." This is based on an old theory from a certain house that states "this kukuru is not 'to dive' but 'to tie/bind.'" Generally, kōketsu appears in legal codes and such, where silk is tied with thread in various places and dyed in crimson, purple, green, and other colors. This is the same as what we now call shibori-dyeing. For more details, please refer to the "Kōketsu-ki."

Record of Arimatsu Kōketsu
The origins of kōketsu have a long history. Already in the Nara period, imperial garments were dyed, and Hōryū Temple in Ryūgata, Yamato Province still preserves Empress Kōken's bedding. It is also recorded in legal codes, scattered throughout the Rokujō, and frequently recorded in various ancient and modern poetry anthologies. Our Arimatsu Village in Owari Province gained its name through this craft beginning in the Keichō era. The ancestor of Takeda Shōkurō moved from Agui Village to Arimatsu and made this his trade. Lord Kei received the Kaya Shrine and entered...

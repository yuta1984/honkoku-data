is performed in the worship hall as an old custom. On the first day of the sixth month, those who participate in the festival from within the Ichiwaki wheel-shaped area come to worship, and on the seventh day they make dolls (Noh dolls, selecting by lottery from two hundred types, both inner and outer varieties). Children who ride in the festival cars practice playing flutes, drums, and musical accompaniment. On the fourteenth day at the hour of the horse (noon), they gather at this shrine for a trial performance. On this day, there is an ancient custom of serving food to the children on oak leaves with side dishes.

According to the Ichie Festival Records, these festival cars originated from the Tennō Imperial Festival, but were discontinued during Oda Nobunaga's Nagashima battle in the first year of Tenshō (1573), and were later revived by masterless samurai including the Hattori and Usami clans. Descendants of this Hattori family still reside in Niage village within Ichie Island, and their house, built during the Tenshō era, still preserves its ancient character. Thus, as an old family with history, they oversee the June festival every year. Details about their family lineage are withheld here due to various sensitive matters.

Because of such prestigious origins, the festival cars received donations from the Shogun including gold brocade Chinese-style weaving kosode robes, gold brocade musical instrument coverings, gold brocade hakama, and other items, which are still used annually to decorate the cars on a grand scale. The domain lord also donated several rice fields for the trial performances.

Great Camphor Tree: Located in Uguira village. This is an extraordinarily rare large tree, and it is said that when local people take resin or leaves from this tree and give them to sick people, they experience the miraculous benefit of immediate recovery. Under the tree there is a small hall with a Yakushi Nyorai (Medicine Buddha) statue said to be made by Prince Shōtoku, and also a Shinmei shrine, so worshippers constantly visit.

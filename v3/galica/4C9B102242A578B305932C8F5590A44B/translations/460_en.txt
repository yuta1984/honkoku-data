　Great Ginkgo Tree

This is commonly called the "Sacred Staff Ginkgo." The story goes that long ago, when Saint Ippen was traveling on pilgrimage through this province, he planted his walking staff in this ground, and before anyone knew it, it had sprouted and taken root, growing into the great tree we see today. I record here the oral tradition of the local people just as it has been passed down.

　How sacred indeed—
　　The saint's staff has become
　　　For all people
　　The power of the teaching
　　　They earnestly seek

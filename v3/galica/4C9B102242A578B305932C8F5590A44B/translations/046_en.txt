From Tsukidashi-machi in Atsuta to Matsuhara-machi in Shimo-Otai, about three ri in distance, streets line up continuously with craft and commercial establishments standing side by side. Feudal lords from the western and northern provinces constantly travel back and forth for sankin-kōtai (alternate attendance), and travelers going up and down between Kyoto and Edo never cease, making this a renowned capital city that rivals even the three great cities (Kyoto, Edo, and Osaka). (Most of the streets within the prefecture belong to Aichi District. Among them, Ōzone, Shimizu, and Shimo-Otai belong to Kasugai District, but since they are continuous with the town, they are included in the Nagoya section.)

Prefecture Castle: Since the Shiba clan, descendants of Owari no Kami Takatsune of the Ashikaga family branch, served as shugo (military governors) of this province, the castle was located in Kiyosu in Kasugai District. More than two hundred years later, in the fifteenth year of Keichō (1610), the old castle at Kiyosu was abandoned and a new castle was constructed here in Nagoya. Following the orders of Tōshō-gū (Tokugawa Ieyasu), twenty feudal lords from the western and northern provinces [assisted in the construction]: Kaga lord (Matsudaira Chikuzen no Kami Toshimitsu), Chikuzen lord (Kuroda Chikuzen no Kami Nagamasa), Buzen lord (Hashiba Etchū no Kami Tadaoki), Chikugo lord (Tanaka Chikugo no Kami Tadamasa), Hizen lord (Nabeshima Shinano no Kami Katsushige), Hizen Karatsu lord (Terasawa Shima no Kami Hirotaka), Bungo Saeki lord (Mōri Ise no Kami Takamasa), Bungo Takada lord (Takenaka Izu no Kami Shigekado), Bungo Usuki lord (Inaba Hikoroku Sukemichi), Hida Takayama lord (Kanamori Izumo no Kami Yoshishige), Bungo Hiji lord (Kinoshita Uemon no Dayū Nobutoshi)

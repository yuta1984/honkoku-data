Suisetsu-rō (Drunken Snow Pavilion) 《Small text: Located near Fuji-viewing area. This is a pavilion overlooking the eastern suburbs with incomparable scenery, a rental hall. It is excellent for holding elegant banquets such as calligraphy and painting gatherings, and visitors never cease to come》

《Small text: Drunken Snow Pavilion Drinking Song　　　　　　　　　Shin Sōrō
There is nothing among flowers, birds, wind, and moon that does not intoxicate; now entering this place, one becomes ever more intoxicated. Cup after cup draws forth drunkenness; three measures also intoxicate, five measures also intoxicate. A temperate body is suited for pure drunkenness; why should we not become drunk? I once read of Lu Lao's twelve drunkennesses; nothing compares to the drunkenness of the Eight Immortals and Li Bai. Let those who cannot understand the drunkenness of Hiraizumi be; pitying this right hand's claw, I recommend drunkenness. Wild cursive calligraphy unleashes madness; monks drunk, and thus Jin dynasty inscriptions are also called "drunk." Who would drink the pure wine toward Zhou Lang? Bamboo gains May's plum rains and becomes drunk. If you wish to ask about my good drinking, I am drunk twenty-nine days a month》

《Small text: Winter of Kōshin year, drinking at Suisetsu-rō with various gentlemen　　Ōkubo Shibutsu
The wine pavilion outside the castle is called Drunken Snow; old friends invite each other, rushing through snow to come. I have been in Koshi mountains, daily blocked by snow; how could I imagine today appreciating snow here? Sometimes ceasing, sometimes coming like spring snow; from afar it looks like smoke, up close it is snow. Tea ripens in stone cauldrons, fragrance surges like snow; sliced fish piled on silver plates like silk snow. Seated poetry recitation, all white snow; guest sorrows all seem like hot water poured on snow. A sixty-year-old man, both temples snowy; coming to Drunken Snow Pavilion's top, drunk on snow》

《Small text: Spring of Kihai year, visiting Suisetsu-rō with various students. The pavilion's master showed me two large scrolls of drunk songs and snow poems by the two elders Sōrō and Shibutsu. I also composed one chapter of drunk snow song to accompany the two elders' poems and presented it to the master　　　　　　Seiichi》

《Small text: At Drunken Snow Pavilion's top, snow of bygone years; Sōrō and Shibutsu came drunk on snow. Both elders, drunk on snow, let their brushes run from their seats; Sōrō composed on the character "drunk," Shibutsu composed on snow. These two drunk snow pieces still exist today. Today we are not drunk on snow, not drunk on snow; spring warmth without snow, people also become drunk. Faces gladly receive the snow of flying flowers; distant mountains' snow melts, heaven seems drunk. Drunk guests point and call out to Mount Fuji's snow; one drunkenness, a hundred worries, spring snow melts. Poetic thoughts in drunkenness colder than snow; suddenly completing this drunk snow chant for the first time. Drunk ink splashes forth, snow on paper bark; nightingales, flowers, snow, moon—all can intoxicate. How can this pavilion alone be drunk on snow?》

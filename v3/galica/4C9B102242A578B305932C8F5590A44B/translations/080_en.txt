Since ancient times, when our former lord first established the scenic bell south of the Kan-shin shrine cluster to announce the time, the people have been inspired to work diligently and prosper. Those who have revered its virtue and enjoyed its benefits now number over a hundred years. Through enlightened governance, the common people use it daily without conscious awareness. On the sixth day of the tenth month of Hōreki Mizunoto-Hitsuji (13th year), the shrine cluster suffered the disaster of raging flames, and both the suspended bell were consumed by fire, instantly becoming nothing. Only then did people realize this was the most indispensable thing.

Thereupon, our lord, valuing the people's affairs, commanded metalworkers to recast it. When removed from the furnace and suspended wing-like from its hook, yin and yang harmonized with neither stagnation nor dispersion, excess and deficiency were well balanced, neither too sharp nor too dull, resonating with a clear tone, continuing the fine sound to reach all four borders. Its voice was resonant yet gentle, peaceful and joyful, and all who heard it throughout the country celebrated together saying, "Which comes first and which follows between Yu's voice and Wen's voice? From dawn to dusk, this is the people's harvest." Our lord was pleased. Indeed, when the pitches of zhi and jue harmonize, this is called "worrying before the people's worries, and rejoicing after the people's joys."

Your subject Yasusada, following the command, respectfully records the reason for thus continuing and restoring the great achievement, proclaiming auspicious blessings for countless ages, following the military tradition of ancient culture, and not adding superfluous inscription words here.

Sacred Treasures: The Eleven-faced Kannon enshrined in the abbot's quarters is a bronze statue of Tang Buddhist origin. Also, the Brahmajāla Sūtra written when Lord Sugawara was eleven years old, an image of Tenjin crossing to Tang with self-painted inscription by Monk Nanka, the Tenjin Origin Record scroll written in Kōan first year, and many other ancient calligraphy, paintings, and Buddhist statues.

Annual Festival: On February 25th, the Great Prajñāpāramitā is chanted before the shrine, and portable shrines are displayed in the votive tablet hall. On this day, temple children from throughout the domain compete to write large characters and post them throughout the precincts until there is no space left. Among the most extreme examples, paper is joined from the top of the tall bell tower down to the ground, with three or five characters written to astonish the eyes of worshippers. Also, for three days before and after the festival day, people come from within the domain and from villages far and near to sell plants on both sides of several blocks of Honmachi Street in a bustling market. Not only potted plants and grafted trees in pots and bowls, but even large trees and tall timber are transported by cart and lined up, creating a scene just like entering a mountain forest.

Monument to Tanaka Michimaro's Residence: Located in the garden of this temple.

Michimaro, commonly called Tanaka Shōbei, later took the name Dōzen. He excelled in Japanese learning and was well-versed in ancient texts such as the Man'yōshū. He was from Haruki Village in Tagi District of Mino Province, but moved here and died on October 4th of Tenmei 4th year.

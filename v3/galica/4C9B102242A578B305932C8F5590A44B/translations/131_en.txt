Tōrin-ji Temple

Tōrin-ji Temple Sitting in the Moon
　　　　Nangen
(From "Tōyū-sō")

With one strike, opening the iron hammer of the Moon Palace, without aperture
The Eastern Sea turns the frost wheel, illuminating all ten directions equally
The dew pillar raises its eyebrows, contemplating the void
Opening its mouth in laughter, host and guest meet together
The hall pine's koto plays an elegant melody

　　　　Tōō (Winter Center)
(From "Haikai Kotō-shū")

The sound of Tang—
　Might be crying,
　　the cicada
　　　at evening sunset

Tōrin-ji Temple
　Bashō Hall Newly Built
　　　Shirō

Butterflies and birds
　All are at peace
　　　beneath
　　flower shadows

　　　Kōzan

People have gone,
　leaving no trace—
　　the Bon
lantern

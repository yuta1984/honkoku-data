The Biography of the Filial Daughter Soyo (There is a monument in front of Mirokuji Temple in the same village)

There was a peasant named Zenroku whose family was poor. He possessed not even one tan of rice fields, and unable to engage in farming, he made his living solely by fishing. His wife had somehow displeased his mother, and when Zenroku was thirty-two years old, she left the house, abandoning their two-year-old daughter named Soyo. After that, he did not seek another wife, and the three of them - mother, father, and daughter - barely managed to get by each day. The mother died when Zenroku was fifty-three.

However, as the daughter Soyo grew up, her filial devotion deepened. She did not dress up, never arranged her hair or applied makeup, and having no man to court her, she found her only joy in serving her parent. From early morning until late at night, she spun hemp and wove cloth, using her woman's work to provide everything - the public tax, and all three necessities of clothing, food, and shelter - barely supporting the two of them. Sometimes she suffered from hunger and cold herself, but never let her parent know. Even when Zenroku made unreasonable demands, she never opposed him, finding her pleasure only in keeping Zenroku in good spirits.

Now Zenroku had been fond of alcohol since his youth. Every day around the hour of the Horse he would drink ten mon worth of sake, and again at the hour of the Monkey he would enjoy another ten mon worth. This was all paid for by Soyo's handiwork, and never failed even for a single day. One time, when she was about to go out and gave Zenroku ten sen as usual, he asked, "Why have you given me only half today?" Soyo replied, "I thought it would be bad if you drank twenty sen worth of sake all at once, so I'm giving you ten sen now. When the hour of the Monkey comes, please look here and there, and you'll find the other ten sen has appeared. That's what makes it enjoyable, isn't it?" Parent and child laughed together as Soyo departed.

Afterwards, he drank the ten sen worth of sake, and when the time came for the second ten sen, he looked here and there but couldn't find any. Finally, exhausted from searching and wanting at least to eat some rice, he lifted the lid of the rice container and found ten sen inside. Thinking this more interesting than usual, he hurriedly bought sake with it and got drunk and tumbled about.

Zenroku was naturally honest and ungreedy by nature, so sometimes he would drink too much outside and collapse drunk in the road. Soyo found this pitiful, and on rainy nights would put on a straw raincoat and hat to search for him, sometimes bringing a mosquito net to care for him on the spot, or carrying clothes to cover him with. Through fair weather and foul, hot and cold, she served him devotedly. When Soyo reached twenty-five or twenty-six, she entered the Buddhist path and practiced austerities...

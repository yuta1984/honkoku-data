Ancient illustration of stone-throwing battles (injuchi)

[Left Page]
After the archery ritual was completed, spectators would compete to seize the targets to use as protective talismans, and eventually it would escalate to throwing stones at each other. People from Nagoya and the surrounding countryside would gather to the north, while those from Seta would gather to the south, fighting with Geba Bridge in the center, to the extent that there were injuries and wounded. This is what was called "stone battles" (ishiikusa) or "stone-throwing fights" (injuchi) in ancient times. This is recorded in works such as "Shiojiri" and "Atsuta Fudoki," and also in "Ōmu Rōchūki" for the 8th and 10th years of Genroku, which records that on January 15th during the Atsuta ritual, a young boy from a Nagoya merchant family was killed - this refers to these conflicts. However, this practice has now ceased.

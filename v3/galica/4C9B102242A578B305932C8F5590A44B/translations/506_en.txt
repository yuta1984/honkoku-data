A rail cries out, people say, at Saya lodging　　　Bashō

《Side note: Master Bashō was born in Iga Province, took the family name Matsuo, learned elegance from the elder Kigin, and was a wandering eccentric who never settled in one place throughout his life. He traveled with the winds in all directions for over thirty years. In early May of Genroku 8 (1695), when seeing off his master's pilgrimage at this Saya lodging, he stayed five days at the residence of one Yamada and left behind a scroll about water rails. Drawn by this connection, the haikai poets of this village flourished like growing bamboo and hemp. Among them, Kicho and Urin took leadership, while Tōki and Shigi provided assistance. Ginzan became the patron, built a mound, erected a monument, and requested an inscription.

The inscription reads:
The master who recited and exhausted all the classical poems, transforming them with emotion and expressing them in form
The master who took distant pillow words and now transforms them into the Kiso road of precious miso
The master who taught those lost in arrogance and false wisdom, making them masters of the true style
The master who dwelt in reality while playing in emptiness, whom we lament as a sage of elegance in this world

Erected on the 12th day of the 5th month of Kyōhō 20, Year of the Metal Rabbit (1735)　　　Gekkū Koji Rosen》

《Side note: In the preface to this poem in Master Bashō's authentic manuscript owned by one Sano, it says "Composed at the host's request when I stayed one night at Saya in mid-summer of Genroku," and the Hakusen-shū records that Rosen and others escorted him to Saya and slept there together》

《Side note: Grass pillow》
The moon leaks through, water rails cry in the night above the dinner tray　　　Sobaku

Saya River《Side note: A large river to the west of the same place》This is the lower reaches of the Kiso River, whose source emerges from deep in Torii Pass at Narai Station in Chikuma District of Shinano Province. All the rivers of Hida and Mino provinces without exception converge here, sometimes branching, reaching the castle town of Kuwana in Ise and flowing into the sea. It is a long waterway of approximately sixty ri with an extremely wide riverbed and an enormous volume of water.

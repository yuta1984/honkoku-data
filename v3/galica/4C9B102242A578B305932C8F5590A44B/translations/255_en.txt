From the "Shin Shūi-shū":
"The resentment of not inquiring about my desolate dwelling shall be known to people only in hiding"
(This is a divine poem from when Atsuta Shrine had fallen into ruin)

Main Shrine Hall: In the "Engi Jinmyō-shiki" it is recorded as Atsuta Shrine (Myōjin Taisha). There are five deities enshrined: Yamato Takeru-no-mikoto in the central hall, Amaterasu Ōmikami and Susanoo-no-mikoto in the two western halls, and Miyasu-hime-no-mikoto and Takeinadane-no-mikoto in the two eastern halls. (The annotation in the "Jinmyōchō" states "The main shrine houses Yamato Takeru-no-mikoto, the east houses Susanoo-no-mikoto, the south houses Miyasu-hime-no-mikoto, the west houses Izanagi-no-mikoto, the north houses Ukanomitama, and the center houses Amaterasu Ōmikami," but this refers to the arrangement of the main shrine and subsidiary shrines, not the deities of the main hall, so they should not be confused)

Doyō Hall (Built alongside the east of the main hall, housing the sacred sword Kusanagi): The "Nihon Shoki," in the Chronicle of Emperor Keikō, records that "the Kusanagi sword worn by Yamato Takeru-no-mikoto is now at Atsuta Shrine in Ayuchi District, Owari Province." The "Kogoshūi" states that "the divine sword Kusanagi is the most important imperial regalia, and has remained at Atsuta Shrine in Owari Province since the year of Yamato Takeru-no-mikoto's triumphant return. When foreign enemies tried to steal and flee with it, they could not leave the country's borders, and the divine power of this sacred object can be understood from this. Therefore, on days when offerings are made, the same reverence should be shown, but it is regrettable that for ages this ritual has been neglected."

The reference to "foreign enemies stealing and fleeing" appears in the "Nihon Shoki," in the seventh year of Emperor Tenji's reign: "In this year, the monk Dōgyō stole the Kusanagi sword and fled toward Silla, but became lost in wind and rain on the way and returned." The same

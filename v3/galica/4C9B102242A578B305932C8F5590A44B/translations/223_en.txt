Shugang (Shukō) Temple

Viewing the kerria flowers at Shugang Temple - Kendō
A thousand acres of kerria in bloom, thick with flowers, yellow petals clustered like ten thousand jewels with abundant stamens blooming everywhere
The tender branches from the previous day sway gently in the dawn wind

Upon seeing the yellow roses (yamabuki) at Shugang Temple

Mogaku

In this world where harsh words
　　are hard to avoid,
how I wish for the color
　　of yellow roses
　　　　　　to exist

Hiroishi Tenjin Shrine {{Note: Located in Hirome village, commonly called Kumano Gongen. This is what appears in the Honkokuchō as "Junior Third Rank Hiroishi Tenjin." Also, there is a Bishamonten Hall in this area, which was anciently a temple complex called Ichijōzan Hiromeji Temple}}
{{Note: and served as the Buddhist temple (jingūji) associated with this shrine. However, the temple complex was abolished during the Keichō era (1596-1615)}}

Ōtani Cave {{Note: Located in Ōtani village, formed when the coastline collapsed into a cave. Below it, broken rocks have fallen and been polished smooth by the lake water, their sharp edges worn away to resemble go stones scattered about. The local people call this the Ōtani cliff}}
{{Note: In all this area, people travel along the seashore timing their passage with the tides. When the shallow water is at high tide, they go up over the mountain to cross. The mountain path is treacherous and moreover circuitous}}

Mount Ontake Kōsanji Temple {{Note: Located in Nishi-Ano village, a branch temple of the Tendai sect's Noda Mitsuzō-in}} According to tradition, it was founded in Hakuhō 12 (683).
It was established by imperial decree of Emperor Tenmu as a great temple with seven halls, so in ancient times it had three hundred sub-temples.
It was caught in the military fires of Bunroku (1592-1596) and was completely reduced to ashes, with only the principal image remaining. A priest with the rank of hōin
named Chōyū rebuilt it, constructing the main hall and great gate. At that time there were eight sub-temples, but
later these also burned down, leaving only one sub-temple, the South Cloister. The present temple is this one. The site of the ancient temple complex
still largely retains its former appearance. ○Principal Image {{Note: Shō Kannon (Sacred Avalokiteśvara)}}

Tokoshima {{Note: In Sōseki's Moshiogusa it is included in this province, and in Sōgi's Hōgakushō it is noted as being near a place called Utsumi. This seems to refer to present-day Tokoname. However, writings that use "Tokoname" rather than "Tokoshima" are old, dating to Eishō}}
{{Note: 4 (1507) in Sōchō's Utsuyama-ki which states "One day of renga at Ise Taki... on the 17th day of the 7th month went out to Ōminato and crossed to a port called Tokoname in Chita District, Owari Province..." and Sōboku's Tōgoku Kikō also records "hurried to Tokoname"}}
{{Note: and so forth." Therefore Tokoshima might well be a different place, but since there is no evidence yet, we can only await future investigation}}

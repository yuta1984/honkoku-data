The name was changed to Myōzen-ji Temple (the characters were altered according to phonetic convenience). Since around the Enpō era, the domain lord has shown deep faith, and the temple prospers to this day. ○ Main Hall (The seven-faced statue was carved by Chaya Chōi and installed in Tenna 3)

Hioki Hachiman Shrine (Located west adjacent to Myōzen-ji Temple. It is called thus because it is in the land of Hioki Village. This is the shrine recorded in the Engi Shimmei-shiki as Hioki Shrine of Aichi District, and in the Honkoku Shimmei-chō as Senior Third Rank Hioki Tenjin. According to the Shinsen Shōji-roku, the Hioki Ason are descendants of Emperor Ōjin's Prince Ōyamamori, so the Hioki Ason likely enshrined Emperor Ōjin as their ancestral deity)

Senbon-matsu (Thousand Pine Trees) (Refers to the area around Hioki Hachiman Shrine. When Lord Nobunaga prayed at Hioki Hachiman Shrine during the Battle of Okehazama, there was a divine response and he achieved victory, so in gratitude he had a thousand pine trees planted. Hence it was called Senbon-matsu, but during the Kanbun years it became a town area. However, many old pines still remain in this vicinity)

Muryōzan Enkō-ji Temple (Located on the west side of Tachibana-chō. A direct branch of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple. Named after its founder Tsunekawa Kambe Nobuhiro. Originally located in Nagashima, Ise Province, it was moved here in Genroku 6, Year of the Rooster)

Gokokuzan Tōrin-ji Temple (Located on the west side of the same town near Ōkido. Ōbaku sect, branch of Manpuku-ji in Uji, Yamashiro Province) Founded in Kanbun 11 by the Chinese monk Sengai (whose dharma name was Anryū), with Zen Master Sokuhi as founding abbot and Daikyū as head priest being his dharma heir. When Daikyū left due to certain circumstances and the temple fell into ruin, it became a branch temple of Manshō-ji and was renamed Kōken-ji (this is the one now in Hioki). Priest Sengai petitioned again and in Genroku 5 rebuilt the Ōbaku temple here, naming it Tōrin-ji, and invited Priest Kōgai from Nagasaki as head priest. ○ Principal Image (Statues of Shakyamuni, Manjusri, and Samantabhadra made by a Ming craftsman are enshrined in the inner hall) Kannon Hall, Bell Tower, Bashō Hall, Great Segaki Ceremony

Beginning with the ancient record in the Ruiju Kokushi of how in the sixth month of Tenchō 6, a court rank was advanced to the filial daughter Kimikobe no Chōshi of Owari Province, and continuing to recent times with the loyal and filial daughters of Yatsuya village in Kaitō district, Torigachi village in this district, and Uguira village, as well as the filial wife Ritsu of Hishino village in Aichi district and the loyal daughter Natsu of Komi village in Chita district—those praised for loyalty and filial piety are too numerous to count.

The fact that the people of this province—women possessing much loyalty and filial piety, and men endowed with courage and righteousness—is entirely due to the two deities Susanoo-no-Mikoto and Yamato-takeru-no-Mikoto being the foremost in martial valor, and their consorts, Princess Inada and Princess Miyasu, being the fundamental source of chastity. Since both are enshrined in Tsushima and Atsuta in this province, it is for this reason that such outstanding women have appeared, and this seems truly reverent and precious.

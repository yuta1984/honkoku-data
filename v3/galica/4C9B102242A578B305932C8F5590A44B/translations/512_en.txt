Kanie River

Both sides of the river constitute Kanie Village, a small urban community of a thousand households engaged in agriculture and commerce. The traffic on the bridge flows continuously without interruption. Fishing and merchant vessels gather here, and rice, grains, and vegetables are traded morning and evening, with many wealthy farmers and merchants. Among them, the Suzuki family's ancestors included Shigemune, who was a disciple of the local castle lord Suruga-no-kami Nobumasa(?). His son Shigeyasu occupied residential land south of the castle.

He died in battle during the Tenshō conflicts, and his younger brother's residence was also reduced to ashes. Later, when Sakuma Nobumori came to this place following the Divine Ancestor (Tokugawa Ieyasu), he gave some timber to Shigeyasu's younger brother Shigeharu for reconstruction. After more than two hundred years to the present day, they remain a continuously prosperous wealthy family.

Going through the reeds,
Passing by Kanie,
Looking out,
Water birds
Forage here as if
Making this their home

Yokosuka

《Note: From "Kinoura Chidori-shū" (Collection of Kinoura Plovers)》
The beach of Yokosuka in Owari Province was anciently called Ama-no-ozaki, and in the middle period was a famous poetic place name (utamakura) known as Kinoura. From around the Hōgen era (1156-1159), it came to be called Umahashirase-no-sato (Horse Racing Village), but during the Tenna era (1681-1684), when the domain lord built the Rinkō-tei pavilion and enjoyed excursions there, he named this place Hama-no-Yokosuka after the name of the upper village. This was because the characters were auspicious.

Sōkenji Temple - An old tale of Priest Minzan

One night, when fire broke out from the priest's quarters (hōjō), his disciples came running to look for the priest. They found him sitting in meditation within the flames, composing a poem in a loud voice:

"Heaven shows a fire disaster at the third or fourth watch (deep night)
Suddenly traveling on foot, a pitiful life  
Ordinarily miserable, like a thatched hut with leaks"

Before he could complete the final verse, heavy rain began to fall intensely, and the fierce fire was suddenly extinguished, so he continued:

"In the midst of raging flames
The sound of night rain"

At this time, the Idaten (Skanda) statue enshrined in the temple kitchen manifested as a great priest and protected against the fire. The painted dragon on the cedar door also emerged and brought forth clouds and rain. Truly, receiving divine assistance through the protective power of virtue was a miraculous response unprecedented in its time.

This poem is said to serve as fire protection, and the Idaten statue of this temple is indeed a miraculous image.

They carry out loads and also load them onto horse carts, transporting them to the capital and neighboring provinces and distant countries, including the three major cities (Edo, Kyoto, and Osaka). This is truly a benefit of the capital's prosperity and should be called a great flourishing event.

Record of the Vegetable Morning Market

The Commentary on the Appended Phrases (Xici Zhuan) states that Shennong established markets at midday, gathering the people of all under heaven and collecting goods from all under heaven for trade and exchange, with each person obtaining what they desired before departing. Regarding the other nine markets and three markets, we shall set them aside and not record them here.

Besides the imperial laws and regulations, markets scattered throughout ancient records and ancient poems are too numerous to enumerate one by one. In our Owari Province, between several streets in Shimootai Village west of Biwabashi Bridge, there is a vegetable market that was established during the Keichō era. The Divine Ancestor (Tokugawa Ieyasu) once said, "This will become a prosperous place in the future," and indeed it became as he predicted.

This market begins at the hour of the Rabbit (5-7 AM) and ends at the hour of the Snake (9-11 AM). Throughout the year, there is not a single day of rest. The clamorous voices of trading are deafening, and the crowded traffic of people coming and going is beyond observation. Products from our Owari and near and far places, and famous products from Kyoto and Settsu provinces—there is nothing that does not converge here. This can truly be called the prosperity of markets. The market leaders number about thirty-eight houses, with Ichibei and Kyūzaemon as their chiefs.

Biwabashi Bridge was originally constructed in the eighth year of Genna (1622), when Lord Yoshinao ordered officials to create it. In the eleventh month of the same year, the lord, following the dying wishes of the Divine Ancestor, commanded Ichibei and Kyūzaemon, residents of Shimootai Village, to protect this bridge, granting them perpetual tax-free rice fields. Kyūzaemon resigned his position for certain reasons, but Ichibei alone has continuously served in this role for 213 years.

This spring, I toured this place, observed the market, and listened to its history, then composed these four lines in two rhymes:

Vegetables and greens, like mountains and hills; without private greed, with widespread benevolence.

Third month of spring, fifth year of Tenpō (1834), Kōjitsu Rōjin

In the scattered forest of the market, birds cry, and in the cold evening shadows, the wind blows fiercely. —Ueda Akinari

Daiyūzan Seikōin (located on the east side of the same town, direct branch temple of Chion-in of the Chinzei sect of Pure Land Buddhism). In Tenshō 17, Third Rank Middle Captain Lord Tadayoshi built it in Mochita Village, Oshi-no-shō, Saitama District, Musashi Province, for the spiritual benefit of his mother, Lady Hōdaiin, and it was called Shōgakuji. When Lord Tadayoshi received this province and took residence at Kiyosu Castle, this temple was also moved to Kiyosu and temple lands were donated. When Lord Tadayoshi passed away in Edo on March 5, Keichō 12, he was interred at Zōjōji Temple, and his Buddhist name was called Seikōin-den, so the temple name was changed to the current one. It was moved here during the transfer of the capital in Keichō 16. The restoring founding priest was Zen Master Man'yo Gendō. ○Main image (standing statue of Amida with Kannon and Seishi on left and right). Temple treasure: Portrait of Lord Tadayoshi (one scroll).

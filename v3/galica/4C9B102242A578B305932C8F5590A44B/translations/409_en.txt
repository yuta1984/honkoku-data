《The National Master took pity on him and told him to compose celebratory songs incorporating the spread of Buddhism along with his original wish, and personally composed and gave him laudatory songs. However, since Chita District's Teramoto Village was also part of this temple's domain, being fellow peasants, they learned this tradition. In later generations, official matters arose, and Ajima manzai performers no longer came to the capital, only coming to perform for their local lords even now. Since Chita manzai performers now dance throughout the capital area, they are commonly called only Chita District manzai. There are altogether five types of manzai with five different songs, but since the lyrics are long, they are omitted here.》

○Shōbō-in Temple《Located in Saburi Village. The year of its founding is not clear. According to tradition, it was formerly an imperial temple of Emperor Go-Toba, with the old name Uhōzan Nyoi-ji, but during the Ōei period, Hōin Ken'yo restored it, and now it has become a branch temple of the Tendai sect's Mantoku-ji in Nagano Village. Later, most of the halls collapsed and only the Jizō Hall remains. There is also an old temple bell with an inscription reading "Meiō 7, year of the Horse, 5th month, 10th day, patron Taira no Ason Munenori." It is unclear who Munenori was, but some say he may have been the castle lord of Saburi Village.》Principal image《Jizō Bodhisattva carved by Unkei》. There are three buildings - Mitsugon-in, Jōren-bō, and Jissō-bō - which together form the monastic complex of Shōbō-in.

○Site of Kagekiyo's Residence《Located in Hangetsu Village. Now it has become rice fields with a small grove nearby. Local people say that in the past, the villain Shichihyōe Kagekiyo resided here. Also, on the southeastern mountaintop there is an ancient pine, commonly called the "watching pine." When Kagekiyo was in this area, he would climb that mountain to view the moon, and because the clear light reflected beautifully and the scenery was particularly excellent, he named the village Hagetsu (Wave Moon). Over time, the pronunciation became corrupted and it became Hangetsu (Half Moon) Village. Also in this village there is a Kannon Hall, and its principal image is said to have been excavated from Kagekiyo's former residence site. However, since ancient records do not mention Kagekiyo's residence in this area, we simply record the oral traditions of the local people and await future research.》

○Hachiman Shrine《Located in Nakajima Village. This place has a large pine forest and sandy roads, so it can truly be called a place of magnificent scenery.》

○Anraku-in Temple《Located in Yabu Village. Called Senyōzan Bodai-in, it is a branch temple of the Tendai sect's Noda Mitsuzō-in. Commonly called Dainichi Hall. In ancient times it was a monastic training hall, but during the Tenbun period it was struck by fire and completely burned down, with only the principal image surviving. In Genki 1, year of the Horse, Hōin Enshū rebuilt it, and now there is one mountain complex with three temples called Myōjō-in, Jōgaku-in, and Gyokusen-in.》Principal image《Dainichi Nyorai》

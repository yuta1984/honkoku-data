[Annotation: Saya/Tsushima] Fork in the road

[Annotation: The post road points north, snow-capped mountains high
Sharp acidic wind scrapes the face like a knife  
How can these weary legs regain their strength?
Beneath the dark pine forest, village sake is sold
　Ichikawa Kansai]

[Annotation:　　　　Tatsuya
At the corner script　now toward the marketplace　we part ways　on the path of the sacred fence　at the ox-head shrine]

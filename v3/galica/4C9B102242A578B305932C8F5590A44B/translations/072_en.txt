(remains there, and what is called "Nagoya San-yashiki" in the old map of Nagoya refers to the same place. Kurando Takanobu was an old local samurai, predating the time when Imagawa Ujitomo was the castle lord)

(It is also said that he may have been a retainer under the Imagawa clan. Yamasan was from that family, and in Shiojiri it is recorded that "Nagoya Inaba-no-kami Atsuyori's son, Yamasaburō, later called Kuemon. His mother was the daughter of Oda Gyōbu-tayū. After Yamasaburō became a rōnin, he took a shrine maiden from Izumo named Okuni and performed women's kabuki in Kyoto Sanjō. Later in Osaka, there were scandalous rumors involving Yodo-dono as well," etc.)

(As recorded, Yamasaburō first served the Gamō family, then became a retainer of the Mori Sakushū lord. According to the Mori family genealogy, "the mother of Mori Jijū Tadahiro was the sister of Nagoya Yamasan," so he likely served due to this connection. It is also said that Yamasan was later killed by one Ido. Okuni's song and dance became famous throughout the world, performing before Lord Nobunaga and Toyotaikō, and entering other noble households to display her arts. Her appearance featured a heavenly crown, white robes, and crystal prayer beads around her neck as she danced. Sometimes she would dress as a man with a sword, wearing a Nagoya obi with braided cords hanging down, or let her hair hang loose while chanting Buddhist invocations and striking gongs as she performed. Generally, regarding the matter of Yamasan and Okuni, there are various theories in the Yōshū Fushi and other modern writings that are not consistent, but it is widely known that these two people originated the art of kabuki)

Bashō's scroll of snow viewing (treasured in the house of the bookseller Fūgetsu-dō in Honmachi First District. The second-generation master of Fūgetsu-dō, Magosuke, was a disciple of Master Bashō and took the pen name Yūdō. In the twelfth month of Jōkyō 4, when Master Bashō stopped by this shop, snow happened to begin falling, so he gave Yūdō an impromptu verse)

(Hearing the name "bookseller Fūgetsu" seemed elegant, and while resting there briefly, snow began to fall)

Come, let's go out / to view snow, even to where we stumble     Bashō
     Early twelfth month of hinoto-u year     Presented to Yūdō

As recorded. Later, when Master Yayū saw this scroll:

     Traces of hands / snow footprints / to an unseen world

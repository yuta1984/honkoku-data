《Note: Literary Collection　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Seiga
At the Great Hall's Jizenji Temple / I once heard Nobutaka fled from enemies / His poems expressing feelings were still elegant / Bidding farewell with sealed letters, emotions ready to break / Self-cutting liver and intestines / A three-foot blade left only bones behind / A pile of ash / Travelers today ask about the remaining traces / Among bamboo groves, pine wind carries sorrow》
《Note:　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Abe Matsuen
Raging waves strike the shore, painting dimly / Knowing the general's anger has not yet stopped / The cleansing pond water remains as before / When hidden blood flew, ghostly fires were blue》

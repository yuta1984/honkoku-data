**Salt Water Bathing Cure**
The seashore to the northwest of Kaion-ji Temple in the same village has many rocky stones, and during hot weather, people from far and near come to this seashore to bathe in the tidal waters, then rest on the rocks, repeating this process many times throughout the day. Continuing this for five to seven days is said to cure all manner of ailments. This is known in the world as the "Ōno Salt Water Cure." During such hot months, the crowds bathing in the seawater are tremendous, with numerous inns accommodating two to three hundred people per establishment. No other hot springs are heard to attract such throngs of people. Those of middle class and above sometimes have the inn draw seawater and heat it again for bathing, but the effectiveness is said to be somewhat inferior to immersing oneself directly in the sea. Also, during breaks from sea bathing, eating one's fill of fresh fish caught in these waters to moisten parched intestines and supplement weakness is said to be another aid to treatment. Moreover, those who overflow from this beach bathe at Higashiura and other places, so one can imagine the prosperity. All of this is said to have begun with a divine vision of Yakushi Nyorai at Kaion-ji Temple.

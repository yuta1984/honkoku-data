Water rails cry at Saya Ferry crossing, wandering on the waters (Randō)

"Board the small boat we're lowering," they say, so boarding and asking for a pole-bearer, we cross Fujigase and ascend the great Kiso River

Blue storm wind
Sand barriers layered
one upon another—
grain in ear
Taisei

Evening moon reaching
into the water—
young leaves
Kiroku

The main thoroughfare resembles the polished surface of a mirror. On both sides, viewing stands are erected with curtains hung and folding screens set up, with felt carpets spread out. Men and women of all social ranks and ages compete in displaying their finery according to their means - a scene of peaceful prosperity that makes one feel even more grateful for divine virtue. After the sacred palanquin returns to the shrine, each household hastily removes their temporary barriers, and shops restore their displays to normal. The crowds of spectators - old and young, men and women mingling together - throng the streets, pressing against each other in the narrow passages. All of this bustling activity is a blessing of divine grace, and the joy of high and low singing "banzai" as an auspicious sign of peaceful times feels truly sacred. The detailed procedures and sequence of the festival rituals are left to the illustrations and omitted here. The artist's brushwork is precise and meticulous in every detail - may viewers contemplate deeply and pay close attention.

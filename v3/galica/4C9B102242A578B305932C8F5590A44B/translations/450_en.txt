Awade Bay: "Owari is mentioned in 'Moshiogusa' (Seaweed Salt Grass). This bay was once an inlet where the tide reached up to the area around Awade Forest, and there were dwellings of sea folk. However, in medieval times, dikes were built and new rice fields were cultivated, making the sea distant and far away. There is no trace of the scene described in ancient poems. It truly gives one the feeling of witnessing firsthand the example of 'fields becoming seas and seas becoming fields.'"

Komachi Mound《Small text: Located in the same village}} In the eighth year of Kan'ei (1631), second month, a mysterious monk of over eighty years came to this village and entered the house of one called Kurō Uemon, asking "Where are the remains of Ono no Komachi?"
When they showed him the location, the village magistrate Akabayashi Takasumi heard of this and invited the monk to inquire about Komachi's origins. The monk's answer was extremely detailed - he took out three volumes of books and related the facts of her entire life, and moreover said "This year marks the 880th anniversary of Komachi's death. The image of Nyoirin Kannon that Komachi held throughout her life should be in the mound. If it appears, it will create karmic connections for all beings and also benefit Komachi's enlightenment." Takasumi and the resident monk Shōhan of Hōshōji Temple, together with Kurō Uemon as guide, dug the mound and indeed obtained a bronze Kannon statue. They then enshrined it in Hōshōji Temple where it is preserved to this day. The mysterious monk disappeared like smoke at that very spot.《Small text: In the same village there is an Abe no Seimei mound.

Upon reflection, both the Komachi mound and Seimei mound are extremely uncertain, but the oral traditions of the villagers are recorded as they are}}

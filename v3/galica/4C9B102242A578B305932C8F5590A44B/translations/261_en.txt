《All the divine ranks recorded in ancient documents are as described above. Also, in the Owari Province Shrine Registry housed in the Nyohō-in, seat of the Atsuta Head Priest, copied in Jōji 3, which appears in the Gunsho Ruijū, it is recorded as "Senior First Rank, First Class Merit, Atsuta Imperial Grand Shrine." The honorific title appears in the Atsuta Lecture Formula of Eishō 6, eighth month, as "Great Pillar of Japan, Atsuta Great God, Ancestral Shrine for the Protection of a Hundred Sovereigns." The Heike Monogatari, Genpei Jōsuiki and other works record this shrine as the third-ranking shrine in the province, following the order from Masumida and Ōagata shrines, but there has been an ancient debate that it cannot be ranked after these two shrines. In the Shintō-shū by Agoi Kai'ei, copied in Eikyō 5, it is written: "Someone said that Atsuta Daimyōjin is the third-ranking shrine in Owari Province of our realm, and also the third-ranking shrine within all of Jambudvīpa"》

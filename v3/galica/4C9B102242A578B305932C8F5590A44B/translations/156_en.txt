(A certain person from Shimaya had Tanaka Totsugon create a copy and donated it to this temple. The inscription reads: "The music of the four strings still resounds clearly today, the famous Lord Ōmaetsu, Akisuke")

One scroll painting of the White Chrysanthemum Biwa (This was also an ancient painting, but in recent years Iwai Shōō created a copy and recorded the history of its transmission on the painting itself. The text is long so I omit it. This biwa is a rare treasure that was anciently stored in the sacred treasury of Atsuta, but later due to certain circumstances, it became imperial property and still exists today)

Hakusan Gongen Shrine (Located on the north side of Oshikiri-machi, commonly called Enoki Gongen. The temple administrator is called Enokimoto-san Fukuman-ji, a branch temple of Kongō Sanmai-in on Mount Kōya in Kii Province, established during the Bunroku era. The origin story briefly states: This shrine was established in the 9th year of Bunmei when Shiba Jirō Tayū Yoshikado, the lord of this province, was residing in Kiyosu Castle and had faith in Hakusan Gongen of Kaga Province. One night in a dream, an old nun appeared saying "I am the spirit of Hakusan. You should establish my shrine by the marsh of Oshikiri in this province. I will protect the warrior houses." Upon awakening from this dream, he established this shrine and enshrined Shinmei and Akiba on either side. There is also one hackberry tree within the shrine grounds, which is the sacred tree of Hakusan, hence the name Enoki Gongen originated here. Although the hackberry has withered in recent years, the common name still remains. The temple bell of this shrine bears the inscription "2nd year of Shōchō, 9th day of 9th month." Everyone from lords of western provinces to Ryukyu people rests at this shrine. The northwest view from the study opens up beautifully with excellent scenery)

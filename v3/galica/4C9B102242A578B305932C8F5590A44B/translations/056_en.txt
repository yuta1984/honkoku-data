April 16th
Sacred Shrine Bugaku (Court Dance and Music)

From Shiojiri:
Today a stage is set up before the deity, and court musicians perform their duties. The various security formations are stationed on the steps and in the spacious courtyard, maintaining solemn dignity. (abbreviated) People of all social ranks are permitted to visit and worship.
Indeed, there are proper protocols for worship, but nowadays, following the example of other shrines, the absence of such restrictions is truly something to be revered. (abbreviated)

General Rules
○Regarding the organizational sequence of this book, the first part begins with the provincial castle (Nagoya Castle), centers on Atsuta Shrine, and ends with Tsushima Shrine. This comprises the lower four districts of Aichi, Chita, Kaitō, and Kaisai among the eight districts of this province to form seven volumes of the first part, while the second part consists of five volumes covering the upper four districts of Nakajima, Kasugai, Niwa, and Haguri, with Ichinomiya, Seto, and Inuyama arranged as beginning, middle, and end. The complete work totals twelve volumes in the first and second parts.

○This province has gentle and flat terrain with few mountains and valleys, fertile soil, and abundant famous products ranging from the five grains and vegetables to fish and shellfish. Villages and population extend in all four directions. Although historical changes have been considerable, the original development is ancient and there are many scenic spots and famous districts. From among these, we select the most renowned, and while we generally omit those belonging to strange tales and folk stories, we occasionally include those whose explanations are of ancient origin.

○Regarding shrines and Buddhist temples whose establishment or founding are recent and lack old theories or ancient traditions, we omit them entirely and do not include them. However, those that are imposingly built with large structures and high ridgepoles are sometimes recorded

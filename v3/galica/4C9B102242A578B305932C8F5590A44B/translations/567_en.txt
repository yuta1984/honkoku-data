Recording his life in summary: The master's surname was Miya, his personal name was Ki, his courtesy name was Shijō, and he was called Jōshin. His father was called Shunsuke, and his mother was of the Nagao clan. On the twenty-first day of the eighth month of Kyōhō 2, year of the Fire Rooster, the master was born in Toriuchi village, Kaisai district, Owari province. From childhood he was intelligent and had a strong memory, surpassing his peers. As he grew somewhat older, he loved learning, and at age ten he excelled at poetry. His father said to him: "Apply yourself diligently. If you do not continue my profession, you are not my son." In Kyōhō 19, he moved with his parents to the capital. Since his father had once studied under Tōgai Genzō, the master also served under him. When Tōgai died, he completed his studies under Rangū Saizō.

In Genbun 4, he encountered the external mourning (his father's death), and in longing grief observed three years of mourning, barely sustaining himself with vegetable gruel, his poverty also being extreme. His mother admonished him saying: "In adversity one should become all the stronger. Do not forget the dying commands." The master honored these teachings, working diligently morning and evening, concentrating his mind and deepening his thoughts, finally mastering the profound principles of ancient learning. In Meiwa 1, he bought a residence in Konoe Lane and was about to move in when he suddenly encountered internal mourning (his mother's death). He observed mourning with complete propriety, and after the mourning period ended, he moved.

At this time, the master's reputation was very high, his virtue and prestige weighty, and students came from all directions, filling his gate morning and evening. In guiding people, he emphasized substance and rejected superficiality, instructing each according to their talents. His character was respectful, modest and yielding, his will pure and his principles firm - neither power nor wealth could sway him. Even in the smallest matters, he would not act if it was not righteous. If he happened to hear a good word or see a good deed, he would certainly record and preserve it. In dealing with people, regardless of age or wisdom, he treated all with courtesy. By nature extremely filial, he grieved over losing his father early, and whenever he performed memorial rites, it was as if serving the living. The master's prose was gentle and elegant, his poetry also sincere and unpretentious, not following contemporary fashions. He loved calligraphy and studied Zhao Mengfu, deeply grasping the standards. When people obtained even a single character or half a line from him, they treasured it as a precious jewel. He also excelled at ink bamboo paintings, with an endless stream of people requesting them. His mother said: "I fear people will take you for a professional painter." The master was moved by this and vowed never to paint again.

His garden had bamboo, so he took the name Inpo (Bamboo Garden), and named his hall Shōyū. His collected poems and prose comprised several volumes, and he also had "Records of Research and Classical Explanations," but all remained in draft form when he passed away. His disciples and close friends privately gave him the posthumous name Kōkyō. He first married a woman of the Iritani clan and had one son who did not survive. His second wife, of the Tobimori clan, bore one daughter, but there was no male heir. Following his deathbed wishes, relatives adopted a disciple named Fuku to continue the ancestral rites and carry on his work. The master lived to fifty-eight years. Benevolent yet not long-lived, filial yet without heir - alas, Heaven! Alas, Fate!

The inscription reads: He brilliantly continued his ancestors' work and became a model for the scholarly world. He sought virtue like one famished, pursued learning like one eating. He enlightened the ignorant masses and found the mean in subtle words. He dwelt in the house of benevolence and assumed Heaven's honor. Was he like Yan Hui or Ran Boniu? In a flash he returned to his roots. His virtuous reputation...

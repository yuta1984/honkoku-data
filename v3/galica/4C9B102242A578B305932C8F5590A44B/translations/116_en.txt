Particularly on May 18th, when each neighborhood offers horse towers and crowds gather to view the spectacular new decorations, and during the 46,000-day pilgrimage, the precincts are truly overflowing with bustling activity. The many votive plaques (ema) hung within the halls, competing in yearly displays of refinement and miraculous achievements, naturally serve as skillful means for the compassionate viewing of all beings and for forming karmic connections with all people.

Sannomaru (Third Bailey)
Diagram of the Sacred Shrine

《Small print: Shien Collection》
Not counting the achievements of Huan and Wen,
Able to gather the wisdom of Zhong Li,
Marching with drums while holding the ceremonial axe,
Gradually consuming all the foul and corrupt,
The day when hegemony was established and Zhou was honored,
The year when success was achieved and Chu was punished,
Chief retainers presented exhaustive strategies,
Brave warriors shouldered spears and halberds,
All bandits lost their courage,
The common people could breathe easily,
Amidst the chaos of flying arrows and blades,
Three victories, with proclamations spread throughout the realm,
Dust and turmoil settled, sun and moon hang over the palace steps,
Conducting ceremonies within the tent,
Wielding military authority beyond the threshold,
The ancestral shrine resplendent with colored decorations,
Shrine officials conducting devout rituals,
Lesser men revering great virtue,
Respectfully looking up before the stone altar.

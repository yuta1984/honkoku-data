One year, a very large lily bulb was cultivated in the village of Fujigase in Owari Province, so large it could be compared to flowers blooming in eight layers. This was sent by Michinao, a person from Tai village, to the nun Ejun. In the capital, it was considered rare and was presented to the Imperial Palace. Having heard of its origins, she felt it most reverent, and the following year as well, very beautiful ones were sent twice over. Relating this matter, she carried them even to a certain court lady and made the presentation. Now, she was asked to compose a poem about this matter, but being quite unskilled in such things, her heart was troubled. However, thinking it would be regrettable to waste such sincere thoughtfulness, she composed as her heart moved her.

Though not the cherry blossoms of old, I offer these eight-layered lily bulbs to the nine-fold palace　Ryūshin Daini

Yokoi Kamon-no-suke Tokinaga (a person from Akame village). His ancestor, Hōjō Sagami-no-jirō Tokiyuki, was the second son of Sagami-no-kami Takatoki. After Emperor Go-Daigo punished Takatoki during the Genkō era, Tokiyuki wandered in exile, but was later pardoned and joined the imperial forces. His son Heitarō Tokimitsu lived in seclusion in Kanie village in Owari Province. His son Heitarō Tokitō moved to Yokoi village in Aichi District and first took the name Yokoi. His son Tokinaga ruled Kaisai District, built a castle at Akame, and resided there. From then on, his descendants each divided and ruled various villages in both Kaitō and Kaisai districts. Even now, the Yokoi clan of this domain continues unbroken in their rule of Akame.

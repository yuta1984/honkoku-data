Kosode-zuka (Kimono Mound) (Located behind a merchant house on the east side north of Kajiya-chō Street, Tsurushige-chō)

A woman of the Yokoe family, lamenting her parting from Lord Moronaga, threw herself into the water and died. The kosode (short-sleeved kimono) that she had received from the lord was hung on the branches of a pine tree at this place, which was her mother's hometown. Eventually a mound was built and it came to be called Kosode-zuka. There was also a pine tree on which the kimono was hung, but at some point it withered and died. Now only one pine tree that was replanted thirty or forty years ago remains, making this a pitiful ancient mound.

View of cherry blossoms on both banks from Hori River's Hioki Bridge

【Engraved seal】Kōga

Matsuda Tsuneharu

The fine wine of Tsuyō, ten thousand measures, rippling and following the waves down Hori River. The cherry blossoms on both banks are white as snow, the small boat accompanies the moon in drunken bliss.

From the deep bottom
the fragrance
drifts across
the flowing
river's
banks where
hang
the flowers'
white waves

《Small text: the old nun would feel helpless. If you gentlemen would kindly look after the old nun, I too would be at peace." All the families agreed to this. From then on, they sent rice to that place every year, as the elderly Sawai Fūken personally related. Though Masanori was a rough warrior, he did not forget his humble past, repaid human kindness, and spoke to the families without shame about his time of low station, showing no arrogant attitude - this should truly be called remarkable virtue》

Matsudaira Kunzan
《Small text: The lonely temple leans against the village ruins, creeping vines spread throughout the empty courtyard. No ceremonial visitors are seen, all is proper and orderly. Cultivated bamboo surrounds the window frames, the mountain gate bears purple moss traces. In the blue hall, the lamp flames burn blue. Receiving palanquins, there is lingering sorrow. My way entrusts itself to the forest valleys. Yielding to circumstances, in the swaying fall, the setting sun slants on the high tower. The twin groves lie in lonely silence, touching mist and clouds. Before the temple, painted horses neigh among autumn grass, in the ropes, white hairs have passed through the years. Flowing water at the empty gate transmits the dharma realm, the long rainbow bridge spans, gazing toward the lute. Climbing and composing poetry beyond the dusty road, stretching one's gaze to the limit where all heavens rain flowers》

Gari Shige  
《Small text: In the Central Plains, purple qi encircles the incense platform, for ten thousand li the vast expanse opens the dharma forms. Leaning on the balustrade, the autumn colors of the long river stir, rolling up the blind, white clouds of distant peaks arrive. The voice of the flowery whale resounds as the old monk descends, the shadow of the singing phoenix flies as the feathered guests return. Still naturally pure in heart for elegant wandering, with abundant leisurely interest in refined pursuits, how peaceful it is》

Tani Naonori
《Small text: Departing west from the golden castle toward the dark blue garden. Dew pure and wind fragrant, the cassia trees flourish. The northern peaks rise high in autumn, connecting to accumulated snow, the southern sky's clouds end, joining the plain. The thousand-year-old ancient Buddha covers the door in silence, many places where pleasure-seekers circle the temple in clamor. The roads in and out never block the dust, horse hooves and bird tracks at the gate of great compassion》

Ta Kōji
《Small text: The high pavilion of great compassion rises majestically steep and tall. Looking far toward the east gate, the great road opens. Treading in clogs, the verdant slopes of Phoenix Mountain draw near, raising a ladder to where white clouds circle the wild goose pagoda. Mid-heaven's wind and rain pass over the railing and depart, lower world's water and mist enter and come to the seat. In the abbot's quarters, Buddhist chants purify the heart, climbing poets repeatedly raise their cups》

Hachimi Shō
《Small text: Mist and clouds deeply lock Phoenix Mountain, green trees shadowy and dense, the monk's quarters serene. Evening bells and autumn wind echo beyond heaven, graceful flowers sway and fall among the five-colored clouds》

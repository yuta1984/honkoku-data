《Indeed. Turning right and going down, one reaches Uwakake Village. Going north upward, one finds a temple called Kannon-ji. This is where I studied in my youth. Pure, quiet, and secluded, untouched by dust and dirt, in spring and summer months, people from the capital》
《often come to visit. Going left from the gate for about a ri, there is "Hirashima Village" - where I was born. Turning right and going down, with cliffs on the right and valley on the left, is called "Dōsaka." Going down the slope, one immediately reaches the sea. Following the shore north for about a ri, one finds red》
《cliffs called "Ichi-no-kake." When the tide comes in, it becomes impassable. One must go along the top of the rocks on the right. About a hundred paces in front of the cliff, something shaped like a horse's back is called "Kōza-ishi" (High Seat Rock). It becomes submerged when the tide comes in. When Minamoto no Yoshitomo died, his retainer》

Daihizan Kannon-ji Temple《Located in the same village, Shingon sect, branch temple of Shinpuku-ji in Ōsu,府下》Principal Image《Shō Kannon》The temple grounds are situated atop sea cliffs several dozen fathoms high, with the hall built at the very peak. Looking down from the hall, ancient pine and cedar trees bend forward showing their treetops, drifting clouds and flying birds constantly pass beneath one's feet, and gazing far to the southwest, famous mountains and blue seas extending for hundreds of ri can be taken in at a glance - the scenery is truly magnificent. However, since this mountain stands as twin peaks alongside Nyorai Mountain quite nearby, I defer to the description and illustrations of Nyorai Mountain and omit details here. There are no literary figures or poets from the capital who have not visited this place, so this temple houses a great many inscriptions of poetry, linked verse, and haiku, both old and new.

《Climbing the Hanging Cliff Daihi Pavilion - Higuchi Yoshifuru》
《Blue waves stretch ten thousand ri, distant peaks' shadows rise and fall. This scenic spot towers high, swallowing the sea, the empty hall soars bridging the peaks. About to spread yellow crane wings, slowly embracing the heart of white clouds. Suddenly connecting with the realm beyond, totally free from the invasion of worldly troubles》
《Same - Yamamura Yoshiki. In the painting of Daihi Pavilion, champaka flowers drift in the wind from the far shore. Dimly visible whale-like forms in the blue sea》

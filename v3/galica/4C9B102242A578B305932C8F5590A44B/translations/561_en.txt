founded [Rengeji temple], when he passed through this village and lodged at a certain house, the woman of that house later became pregnant. The master of the house suspected that the child might be the result of an illicit affair with the traveling monk. When [Kōbō Daishi] passed through again, the man told him of this matter and showed him the child. Although there had been no such transgression, [the master] was saddened by such suspicion, and perhaps thinking that no matter how well he explained, the man's doubt would not be cleared, he took tea that he held in his hand into his mouth and blew it onto the child, whereupon the child immediately disappeared. It is said that the village came to be called by this name from this incident.

Ichie Island
The eight villages of Ninoue, Uguiura, Nishiho, Tōho, Nishijō, Tōjō, Honbuda, and Gonosan are collectively called Ichie and constitute the old territory of this district. In the "Namiai-ki" it appears as "Ichie." Now it is written as "Ichie." In the "Jōō Kaidō-ki" it states: "At nightfall, I stayed at a place called Ichie. Looking down in front, the sea penetrates inland and the river god's people are nurtured behind; looking up, peaks tower and the mountain deity's hair is combed by the wind. The night waves beating against the rocks emit thousands of lights, and the dawn flying squirrels crying in the trees break the dreams of a solitary pillow. Though my heart finds solitude in staying at this place, I am drawn out by friends as dawn breaks. The harsh roots of pines and the wave-pillow of the rocky shore - even grown accustomed to lying here, might it still be hidden in my sleeve?" and so forth. From this we can know the antiquity of the name Ichie.

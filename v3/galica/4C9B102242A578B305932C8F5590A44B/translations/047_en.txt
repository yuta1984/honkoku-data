Looking upon
　the radiance
　　of this land—
　the evening sun
shining bright
　upon the castle's
　lofty
　　ramparts

《Bōkyū Shisen (Bōkyū Poetry Collection)》
Flowers and mist hang low beyond the railings,
Ascending a hundred-foot heavenly ladder.
Gazing into the distance, all mountains appear small;
Leaning upon the heights, ten thousand trees are uniform.
Calling clouds to seal the valley mouth,
Sending shadows to hide in the forest's heart.
Always eager for the revolving light to shine,
Transcendent in thought, without confusion.

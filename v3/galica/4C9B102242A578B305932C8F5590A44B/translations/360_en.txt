(It is said that jade-gathering stones reach this place, so the local people call them gravel stones. There is also Mount Ise in Hisa village, and throughout this district there are ancient sites of Ise Grand Shrine's divine households and imperial granaries scattered in various places.)

Utsumi (Inner Sea) - Originally a manor name, this entire area was the Utsumi Manor. It appears as "Utsumi" in the Azuma Kagami and in Sōgi's Hōgaku-shō, and is written as "Uchimi" in the Matsuba-shū as a famous place of Owari.

The seashore of this district is particularly rough with waves at this Utsumi Bay. Therefore, various stones and seashells are frequently washed ashore, becoming playthings for children. We illustrate one hundredth of these to introduce them widely to the world. There are also many seaweeds. Particularly what is called jinme-sō (divine horse seaweed, also known as nori-so) is so named because Empress Jingū fed this seaweed to horses during her conquest of the Three Korean Kingdoms, as recorded in the Kagaku-shū. Its taste also has considerable elegant appeal.

(From "Nayose")
At bays near the sea, pine trees make sounds, and waves crash - the evening wind from offshore Utsumi - Kamo no Chōmei

Mirage - A atmospheric phenomenon that appears on the sea surface during clear weather at the border of spring and summer in the bays of this area. Within what looks like hazy smoke and mist, the forms of mountains, castle compounds, banners, castle towers, bamboo and trees, and even the movements of people and livestock appear, then disappear again shortly after. This is what is called a "sea market." In Suō it is called "hama-yū" and in Etchū it is called "fox forest" - all the same phenomenon. It is also said to be vapor exhaled by giant clams. The Records of the Grand Historian's Astronomical Treatise states: "Vapors from the sea form images of towers and terraces, vapors from wide plains form images of palaces." This is what are called sea markets and mountain markets, and the gandharva cities mentioned in Buddhist texts are also the same phenomenon.

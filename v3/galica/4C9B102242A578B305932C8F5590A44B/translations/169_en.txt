The prosperity of our domain is manifested in the Bon festival. The dances of the various towns are naturally part of this, but among them there are small carts beautifully decorated, with sword-shaped ornaments and box purifiers erected in the center, which are pulled around. These are called bonten. Bonten are a type of ritual offerings used in ascetic water purification practices, so this name likely refers to the sword-shaped ornaments and box purifiers in the center. The Bōtei-kō records that this is a festival for the Gozu Tennō deity, while the Nenjū Gyōji-shō states that it is a festival for the Bonten-ō. Additionally, the cut-paper lanterns of Kami-Zaimoku-chō are displayed by each household, creating yet another spectacular sight to behold.

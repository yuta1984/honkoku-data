　　　Hakuba

From "Kyujo-shu Furoku" (Dove Staff Collection Appendix):
　The plant vendors have
　　brought and scattered about
　　　　　their trees
　　　on the festival day
　In a single night
　　　here too become
　　like a thousand
　　　pine trees

　　　Baikan
　For about ten blocks
　it becomes like
　　　a single haze—
　the plant
　　　shops

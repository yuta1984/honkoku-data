Hōrai (Penglai)
The grounds of Naiten Shrine are called Yomogi Island. In Sōgi's "Secret Commentary" it is recorded: "Yomogi Island refers to Chikubu Island in Ōmi, Atsuta in Owari, and Shika Island in Tsukushi. However, the truth is that it is the Dragon Palace."

In "Consideration of Japanese Shrines" it states: "In Japan, there are three places designated as Hōrai: Fuji, Kumano, and Atsuta." Also, in "Eastern Sea Jeweled Flower Collection" it is recorded: "When Xu Fu of Qin entered the sea to seek the elixir of immortality on the three divine mountains and found sea islands but never returned, this referred to Atsuta."

From "Jōō Highway Record"
When passing before Atsuta Shrine, one kneels before the manifestation of divine benefit and bows the head in sincere reverence (etc.). Even without seeing Hōrai Island or obtaining the elixir of immortality, the pleasures upon the waves are life's great joy. Is this not the art of longevity?

Those who constantly worry in their hearts about growing old are the ones who should obtain the medicine of the famed island

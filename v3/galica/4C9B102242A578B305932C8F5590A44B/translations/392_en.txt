Shōjū-in Temple

Passing by Shōjū-in, composing on the Dragon Lantern Pine

Fukada Meihō

I hear there was a high priest here
A dragon deity offered lanterns at night
The pine before the gate still remains
Catching the moon as it begins to rise

【Carved signature seal】Shunkō

The storm from the peaks
　at the foot of the mountain
　　against the rocky shore
　crashes the waves—
even these
　sound like
　　the voice of
　　　Buddhist chanting

　《Former Abbot》
　　Sen'a

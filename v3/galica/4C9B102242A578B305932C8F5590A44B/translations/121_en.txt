They built an altar and purified the ground, enshrined Yakushi Nyorai (the Medicine Buddha) on the altar, burned the famous incense called "Kyakushi Hangonkō" (Death-Reversing Soul-Returning Incense), and performed the Iō Mitsuhō (Healing King Secret Dharma). The incense smoke covered the child's face, and he immediately revived, allowing father and son to recognize each other. They spoke of their mutual affection for a while, but then the child died completely. Having no choice, they buried him at Shōgaku-in and built seven temple buildings and twelve monk quarters in the twelfth month of Enryaku 6 (787) for his spiritual benefit. (It is called Nanatsu-ji [Seven Temples] because seven temple buildings were constructed for the seven-year-old deceased child.) In this way, the temple buildings fell into decline due to floods in the seventh month of Ninna 3 (887), fires of war in Tengyō 4 (941), and other disasters. However, during the reign of Emperor Rokujō, when a beloved daughter of Owari no Gon-no-Kami Ōnakatomi no Asomi Yasunaga died on the 15th day of the sixth month of Jin'an 2 (1167), he consulted with his daughter's husband, Bungo no Kami Chikasane, and rebuilt those seven temple buildings and twelve monk quarters for her spiritual benefit. They renamed it Tōen-zan Chōfuku-ji and made it a branch temple of Kōya-san in Kii Province. They also invited the Fifteen Gongen deities to serve as the protective guardian deities of the temple.

"Kinoe-ne Travel Record" - Visiting Atsuta
The shrine grounds were greatly damaged, the earthen walls had collapsed and were hidden in grass. Ropes were stretched here and there, stones were placed to mark the sites of small shrines, and people claimed them as their deities. Even so, what arose from the heart of remembrance was more moving than joyous.

Even remembrance withers - buying rice cakes at this lodging　Bashō

"Zuien Travel Record" - Offering at Atsuta
In Bashō's Kinoe-ne travel record (omitted) it is written "more moving than joyous." There are times of rise and decline; now in Kinoe-inu year, with new construction, it is again joyous.

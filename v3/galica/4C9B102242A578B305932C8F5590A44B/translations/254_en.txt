Illustration of Lord Nobunaga's departure for battle

According to the "Okehazama Battle Record," "Hakka Zuihitsu," "Biyo Zakki," and other sources, when Lord Nobunaga visited Atsuta Shrine, a man wearing a persimmon-colored undergarment and haori was crouching by the side of the Chinko Gate. When the lord asked him, "What province are you from?" he replied, "I am from Ochiai Village. I come here daily to pray for my wishes, but today I came because I heard there would be a battle." When asked "How will the battle go?" he answered, "Without doubt, you will be victorious." His expression seemed extraordinary, so the lord called him closer and inquired about his background.

"I am the youngest son of Hara Kaga-no-kami, a retainer of the Takeda family of Kai Province. In my youth, I became a disciple at Daijo-ji Temple in Suruga, but due to matters of male love, I quarreled with seven close attendants of the Imagawa family, killed five of them, left Suruga, and hid in Ochiai Village in Chita District, changing my name to Kuwabara Jinnai."

Lord Nobunaga said, "Then you must know Yoshimoto and his retainers well. Guide us and help us achieve victory," and they held secret discussions. Jinnai

accepted and said, "This time I will offer my life to you, my lord. If I am fortunate enough to survive, please grant me a reward."

The lord bestowed upon him the armor he was wearing and a sword by Kunimitsu. Jinnai preceded the lord to Odaka Village, chatted about old times with Imagawa retainers, and learned about the situation at Yoshimoto's main camp at Dengaku-hazama. Taking advantage of the carelessness caused by wind and rain, he infiltrated the camp, approached Yoshimoto, easily grappled with him and stabbed him to death. The nearby samurai retainers were shocked and gathered together, killing Jinnai. Lord Nobunaga's victory was entirely due to this man's guidance.

In later years, whenever someone spoke to Lord Nobunaga about the Battle of Okehazama, he would always mention Jinnai, praising his courage and shedding tears.

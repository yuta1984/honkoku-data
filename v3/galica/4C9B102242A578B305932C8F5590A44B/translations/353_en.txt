Susa Inlet

Gon-Dainagon Akitomo

≪From Shoku Kokin-shū≫
When winter comes to an end,
even the hidden marsh
of Susa Inlet
has turned to icicles
because of the cold wind

Tokiwai Nyūdō, Former Daijō-daijin

≪From Shoku Shūi-shū≫
In the fierce wind
at Susa
Inlet,
waves surge over
and my sleeves are soaked
most disagreeably

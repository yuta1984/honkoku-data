Prince Yamato Takeru
bestowing the treasured sword
as a keepsake when parting
with Princess Miyasu-hime no Mikoto

《Marginal Note: | Literary Collection》
Conquering in the east and subjugating the east,
Attacking in the west and returning from the west,
His martial prowess magnificent,
All four directions are properly governed.
The imperial prince is filial,
This is certainly beyond doubt.
The Emishi flee and scatter,
The barbarian tribes are mowed down and destroyed.
Greatly manifesting his outstanding achievements,
The imperial merit is truly brilliant and glorious.

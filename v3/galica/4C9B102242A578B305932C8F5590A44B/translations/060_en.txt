　Observing the ritual ceremony
　of the Divine Ancestor on April 17th

　　　From Fukada Kōsai
From Kōsai's Posthumous Works:
　Children emerge from the castle in throngs at dawn
　On the palm-like (flat) streets where rain has just cleared
　Who would know of the past
　Wars and conflicts, all bathed in waves of benevolence
　Observing this age of great peace

Jewel of Eighty Bays:
Of the peaceful country
ruled by our sovereign emperor,
may it become ever more
a peaceful country for eternity.
Though divine, the deity who resides
as a god, the Eastern Illuminating Divine Command's
sacred image together with the sun and moon
shines eternally,
and the beautiful bridges of the four directions under heaven
remain tranquil and joyful.
The blessings of this deity
spread widely throughout the realm,
filling it completely,
and throughout the long ages, especially on this day,
people revere and worship that sacred spirit,
all honoring that sacred image,
singing and dancing, performing kagura
while serving and enshrining the deity.

It is the Divine Command who illuminates the east
of the emperor's great realm
　　　　　　　　　who truly rules.

Kongōsan Chōei-ji Temple (located on the east side of Haitori-machi, Sōtō Zen sect, branch temple of Shōgan-ji in Mifuchi village, Kasugai district). The temple was established in Kiyosu during the Eiroku era (1558-1570) by Chōei-ji Hanshitsu Ei Kō Zenji, the aunt of Lord Nobunaga (wife of Maki Yamato-no-kami Nagayoshi, lord of Kawamura Castle in Kasugai district, and sister of Bingo-no-kami Nobuhide), and was relocated to the current prefecture (Nagoya) during the Keichō era (1596-1615). The birth Buddha statue at this temple is made of gold, with water spouting from the mouths of two bronze dragons—a rare type of Buddha-bathing ceremony implement in the world. ○The principal image is a seated statue of Shakyamuni.

On the 9th day of the 3rd month, spring of Ox year, Anei 10 (1781), at the invitation of Naitō Kansui, nine elderly men of advanced age from the prefecture gathered at this temple to hold a "Honoring Age Assembly" (Shōshi-kai), where each composed poetry, waka, linked verse, and haiku. The participants were:

Tsuzuki Takashi (courtesy name Jūkoku, pen name Senshū-sai, common name Dōki, 104 years old, Chinese poetry), Shimizu Naritoshi (pen name Shūboku-ken, common name Shōsaku, 93 years old, waka), Matsudaira Hidekumo (courtesy name Shiryū, pen name Kunzan, common name Tarōuemon, 85 years old, Chinese poetry), monk Kōshō (former abbot of Tōkai-ji, courtesy name Tatsusen, pen name Kōzan, 84 years old, waka), monk Keiin (retired abbot of this temple, courtesy name Jōho, pen name Myōjō-an, 83 years old, Chinese poetry), Ojika Son (courtesy name Ryōkō, pen name Mukōteki, 82 years old, Chinese poetry and kyōka), Yokoi Namimei (courtesy name Hakukai, pen name Hansō-an, also called Bosui Matayaari, 80 years old, waka), Nagata Tadayoshi (pen name Chōshū-ken, common name Kosen, 80 years old, haiku), monk Kakuyū (former abbot of Tennō-bō, courtesy name Kōdō, pen name Hakuun-kyo, 80 years old, waka).

In addition, they published and distributed one volume called "Record of the Honoring Age Assembly" containing calligraphy, paintings, and poetry by refined literary figures. Also, in the 12th month of Meiwa 6 (1769), the old man Yaari erected a monument at this temple during his lifetime, inscribing: "Whatever it may be, people must endure; even if a fleeting name remains in the heart after death" (appeared in the haikai collection "Yume no Tate").

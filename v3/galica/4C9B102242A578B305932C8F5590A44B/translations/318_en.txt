Feeling moved upon seeing kōketsu dyeing
　　　　　Ryūkyū

The wondrous patterns of kōketsu are transmitted through ten thousand ages
Descendants continue the lineage
The technique flourishes ever more
Many people come and feel admiration
Elegant and marvelous craft
Thousand-year Arimatsu
In the deep verdure

Since ancient times
　A thousand generations'
　　Promise, perhaps—
　At Arimatsu
　A thousand ties, eight thousand ties

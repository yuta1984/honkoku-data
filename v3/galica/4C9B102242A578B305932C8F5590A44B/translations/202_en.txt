　Visiting Yōnenji Temple
　　　Teinosuke
Several ri east of the castle, the path does not lead astray
Water like the character "person" reflects in the forest dwelling
Companions like immortals holding wine in the high tower
Wife of dharma joy brewing tea in the abbot's chamber
Looking closely at peacocks within the folding screen
Quietly facing wild ducks above the pond
Wishing to respond to the beautiful scenery with poetry
Sitting until reaching the balustrade when the Big Dipper hangs low

　Same as above
　　　　Unka Dōjin (Cloud Flower Monk)
Viewing lotus at the ancient temple in the pure morning
Above the pond, green moss makes a cushion
Hidden in Mahayana flowers, they cannot be seen
Red reflections in the water bathe the beautiful lady

　　At Karasu Pond　　Akatsuki Gyō

Evening coolness -
　　　floating lotus leaves
　　　　　line up together

　　　　　　　　Seigen

Carp leaping -
　　　sleeves getting wet
　　　　　in evening coolness

　　　　　　　　Gessai
What coolness -
　　　even staying put,
　　　　　the moon on the boat

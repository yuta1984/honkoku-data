Site of Hachisuka Kurando Masatoshi's Residence (located in the same village)

The Komyo-ki (Record of Famous Deeds) states: In the middle period, there was a man named Hachisuka Kurando Minamoto no Masatoshi in the village of Hachisuka in Owari Province. He was originally a descendant of the Shiba Military Guards, but when the Military Guard house fell into decline, he secluded himself in this village, took the place name as his family name, governed merely a hundred kan worth of land, lived alongside common houses, and his name became obscured with no one knowing of him.

In the sixth year of Taiei (1526), he had a son whom he named Hachisuka Korokuro. As the boy grew, he came to possess the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, becoming a fine warrior of intelligence and valor. Initially, he served under Oda Juro Zaemon Nobukiyo, lord of Inuyama Castle. One day, while Nobukiyo was away on other business, enemies came to spy and surrounded Inuyama Castle. Korokuro defended and fought, drove off the enemies, and struck down the enemy commander with his spear. The whole world admired his military achievements.

Later, when he was serving under Oda Hyoe-no-jo, lord of Iwakura Castle, retainers rebelled and surrounded the castle. Korokuro then charged out, drove off the enemies, crossed spears with them, took heads, and gained fame. From then on he served Lord Nobunaga, and achieved merit in battles against Saito Tatsuoki of Mino Province.

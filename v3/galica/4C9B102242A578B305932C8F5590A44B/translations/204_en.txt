Tokukozan Kenchuji Temple《Small text: Located east of Kyomachi-dori, Jodo sect temple without main temple, serving as the family temple of successive domain lords》In Keian 4 (1651), it was established as the memorial temple for Zuiryuin-dono's father, Lord Gen'kei. The priest Kakudon from Kokyoji Temple in Yuki, Shimosa Province was invited to serve as the founding priest. In the second month of the fifth year, after the construction was completed, Kakudon went to Kyoto and on the 22nd day of the sixth month, he had an audience at the imperial palace and received the imperial edict (rinji) granting purple robes to successive head priests, then returned. The temple grounds are vast, with numerous halls including the mausoleums and memorial halls of successive domain lords, their wives, and branch family members, all built with the finest craftsmanship. There are also many precious donated treasures, but I omit details here for fear of committing impropriety. ○Principal image《Small text: The Amida Buddha is the work of the Buddhist sculptor Tori, a sacred statue once owned by Kakudon. The sculptor Tori lived during the time of Prince Shotoku》

Having strived for military merit and exerted all his strength to slay Maeda Yojūrō, Kazumasu returned to Ise, was ashamed of this, went up to the capital, and then fled to Tanba. When Hideyoshi heard of the Battle of Kanie, wanting to assist Takigawa, he departed from Ōgaki and headed to Kanie. Since Kazumasu had already abandoned the castle, Hideyoshi immediately returned to the capital (and so forth).

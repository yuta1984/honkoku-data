《Note: From "Rokujō Eimō" (Six-Volume Collection of Poetic Seaweed)》
I hear there are jewels at Kinoura bay, but these white jewels of the waves cannot be grasped by hand　　Roan
The cresting waves cannot be seen rising and falling, stretching far into the misty morning calm of Kinoura bay　　Isoashi
Unaccustomed to standing in the morning mist of Kinoura bay, the spring wind still blows cold through my sleeves　　Mino
The sleeve shells that maidens gather as they descend are found clinging to Kinoura bay　　Nichijun
The colored shells that appear dyed with evening colors seem like the lining patterns of the famous "Kinoura" robes　　Kadō
In autumn, when fishing for gobies at Kinoura bay, my hem gets wet with waves and will not dry　　Shōzan
Thinking it's plovers running, I see a flock of plovers at Kinoura bay until it seems to burst open　　Ugawa
Since this is the cold, windy bay of tattered robes, perhaps the plovers are running to mend them　　Ippōntei
Ink-black darkness - plovers at Kinoura bay　　　　　　　　　　Tōho

Kotohiki (Koto-playing) Pine《Note: Located within the grounds of the Shugendō Daikyōin temple in the same village. It is an ancient trunk of several hundred years with greatly flourishing branches and leaves, preventing sunlight from filtering through the temple grounds. Though thick green moss is not swept away, no dust is seen. Even without wind》
《Note: Since its voice never ceases, the name "Kotohiki" (koto-playing) is not without meaning. Such a great tree is truly a rare ancient pine of this world, so we record it here so that its name may be transmitted eternally until the end of a thousand generations along with the pine's longevity》
What remains unchanged is not only the green - the pine wind in the garden also sounds eternal　　Hotta Baie

Chōeki Mound《Note: Located in Hirashima village. The monk Chōeki was the founding priest of Hōkoku-ji temple in this village and lived during the Tenshō and Bunroku eras (1573-1596). He was originally a person of firm moral virtue and wisdom, but once when villagers came to the monk and offered him sake, after becoming intoxicated》

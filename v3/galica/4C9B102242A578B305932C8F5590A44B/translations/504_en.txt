Illustration of an ancient ship excavated in Morokwa village

In the intercalary 4th month of Tenpō 9, when dredging the river in this village, they struck something like ancient wood near the back of a temple called Manjō-ji. Everyone found this suspicious, so they dug deeper and excavated a very large ship. This ship was made in ancient times and was a camphor wood dugout canoe, but it was joined in three places with crossbars inserted through them. Also from within the ship came large net anchors, old roof tiles, old coins, and many other strangely-shaped rare vessels. When they then dug around that area further, they excavated the torso of a wooden Buddhist statue. Now, this village has the Shikinai Morokwa shrine

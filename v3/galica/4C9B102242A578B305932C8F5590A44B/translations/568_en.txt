Soyo-onna (A Woman Named Soyo)
　Illustration of Filial Devotion

While there are many parents who are lost in the way of thinking about their children, children who repay their debt of gratitude are rare. Here, having heard of someone who, though of humble station, practices filial piety toward their parents, I composed this poem with continued reflection.

How admirable - though the body is lowly,
　to serve one's parents with devotion,
　　how noble is that heart!

　　　　Lord Reizei Tamemura

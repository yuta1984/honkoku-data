Utsumi Bay - Sardine Nets

Sardine fishing operates daily from May to October. One netting operation involves hundreds of people and nineteen boats. Specifically, this includes two large boats, two net boats, three hand boats, and twelve saitoru boats, which together comprise what is called one large net operation. The size of the net is approximately 362 ken in length and 65 ken in width. First, upon the signal from the lead fisherman who assesses the abundance of fish, the net is lowered. Once the fish enter the net, it is hauled in from both sides to the net boats, and using a tool called "totta," the fish are scooped into the large boats. From there, they are measured into the saitoru boats using baskets that hold five to (about 90 liters each). Generally, one netting yields about 1,300

baskets. Also, when sardines are caught in great abundance, tuna are often caught as well.

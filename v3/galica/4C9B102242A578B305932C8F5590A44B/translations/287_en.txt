Sacred Lands《On the 8th day of the 6th month of the 1st year of Shuchō under Emperor Tenmu, 18,000 chō were donated, and it is said that until the Shōō period there were sacred lands within the three provinces of Owari, Mikawa, and Mino, but these were discontinued. Even now, in the ritual prayers read during the sacred festivals of the 2nd and 11th months, the phrase "sacred lands of 18,000 chō" appears, which is evidence of this ancient tradition remaining. In the Shoku Nihon Kōki it is recorded that "On the day Mizunoe-Uma of the 6th month of Tenchō 10, by imperial decree, Jūsanmi Atsuta Ōkami, seated in Owari, was granted Shōsanmi rank and fifteen tribute households." This is the first mention of sacred lands in national histories. Matters of sacred households and sacred taxes are frequently recorded in ancient documents. The Engi Rinji Sai Regulations also record that "Generally, the sacred tax grain of the three shrines Kamo Mioya, Wakeikazuchi, and Atsuta may not be used for purposes other than shrine affairs"》

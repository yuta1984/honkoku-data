(Side note: Outside the lonely Zen gate stands a pavilion about a hundred feet high. Who is it that on a moonlit night whistles long, creating the voice of a phoenix?)

(Side note: Throwing bait and tapping the railing, they are accustomed and not startled. In the shadow of the priest's robes, they come with heads aligned to greet. The heart is joyful and at ease, thinking of Master Zhuang. How could this not match the fame of Baosheng?)

Ubagamori (located north of Ōmiya, where natural stones are worshipped at a shrine called Uba no Yashiro. Long ago there was a cave here where descendants of the Somin deity lived. Though there is no cave now, the local people call this place "Uba-ga-futokoro" (Old Woman's Bosom). According to tradition, when Susanoo-no-mikoto descended here, an old woman received a divine oracle at this place, so the present shrine was built.)

Umazu Old Post Station: The Engi Military Regulations state "Owari Province post horses: Umazu and Shinkō villages, ten horses each; relay horses: Ama and Aichi counties, five horses each." This old post station is now abandoned and its exact location is uncertain. Mano Tokitsuna's "Monto Private Records" states: "There is a forest at Umazu port; this is the ancient Imori. The name Umazu is now called Matsukawa in local dialect."

The Nihon Kōki records that in the 5th month of Kōnin 3 (812), on the day of kinoto-ushi, "Ise Province reported that relay horses were established only for transporting newly appointed officials, with no other riding purposes. Now, traveling from Enoma Station in Kuwana County to Owari Province is already a water route, yet relay horses are uselessly maintained, long causing hardship to the people. We humbly request to follow the order of cessation and permanently end this troublesome labor." This was approved.

The Akazome Emon Collection records: "When going down to Owari... staying at a place called Umazu for the night, when leaving the temporary lodging to proceed, [I saw] about two men rowing across in a small boat. When asked 'What are you doing?' they replied 'We're going offshore to gather cold seaweed.'"

Also, a document from Eiso 1 (989) from Owari states: "Due to the absence of ferry boats at Umazu crossing, local small boats and ferry people are troubled with transport duties... ferry boats should simply be stationed at the ferry point. This is the most difficult place on the sea route, where official messengers traveling up and down are delayed." All of this indicates it was a station near the riverbank.

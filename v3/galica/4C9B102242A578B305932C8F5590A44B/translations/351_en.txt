Illustration of offering fish to the principal image of Anrakuji Temple

According to the "Honkokuchō Shūsetsu" (Collected Explanations of the Provincial Register), every year on the third day of the first month, the villagers offer fish and meat to the Amida Buddha of this temple and hold a festival, followed by a communal meal. This custom likely originated when Himaka Shrine fell into decline during the medieval period and the honji-butsu (Buddhist manifestation of the Shinto deity) was moved to this temple. It is the custom for all women of this island to make a pilgrimage to this principal image on the 110th day after giving birth.

The Ancient Tale of Yang Guifei

Song of Eastern Japan
By a Ming person
Song Jinglian

Yang Yuhuan's evil blood polluted the world - how could there be spirits
Who would enshrine demon heroes in shrines?
It is not that the immortal mountains are truly ethereal,
But her snow-white skin and flower-like beauty ruled the jeweled palace
(Note: The country has a Yang Guifei shrine)

There are also many small shrines such as Inari and Hachiman Shrines, as well as small halls including the Goma Hall, Taishi Hall, and Dainichi Hall. The temple grounds have many ancient trees of white cherry blossoms and red maples, making it a famous spot where monks, literati, women—both clergy and laity without distinction—come to seek out spring and visit in autumn. Moreover, on the southeastern pond, teahouses line their eaves facing the water surface, serving rare delicacies for the entertainment of passing guests. This can truly be called the finest scenic spot in the domain. ○ Sacred Treasures: Standing statue of Yakushi Nyorai (Tang Buddhist sculpture), Standing statue of Fudō Myōō (work of Chishō Daishi), Painted image of Nyoirin Kannon (brushwork of Kōbō Daishi), Lion head (work of Buddhist sculptor Kasuga), Painted image of Jizō (Tang painting).

Reishōzan Zentoku-ji Temple (located on the east side of the same town, Sōtō Zen sect, branch temple of Shōgen-ji in Mifuchi village, Kasugai district). This temple was founded during the Ōei period and was called Bodai-ji, located in Takegahana village, Haguri district (now belonging to Mino Province). Because it was under the lineage of Priest Gen'ō, it was expelled from the Sōtō sect due to the false teachings regarding the Killing Stone of Nasuno, and eventually fell into ruin. In Bunki 2nd year, Priest Dairin of Eiheiji Temple in Echizen Province and Priest Sensō of Shōgen-ji Temple consulted together and restored it, changing it to the lineage of Priest Ten'ō and renaming it Reishōzan Zentoku-ji Temple.

There, Keichi, who had been lying in wait behind the sliding door, struck with a single blow to both knees to prevent his escape and cut him down (died at age thirty-eight, the same age as Yoshitomo. There are various accounts of his final moments, but they are omitted here). When Genko heard that his lord had been killed, thinking "This must be Masakiyo's doing," he grabbed his long sword and ran about, but when he heard that Masakiyo had already been killed, he said "Then I shall kill Osada," and together with Kaneo-maru, the two of them cut down many enemies at Midare Bridge (Midare Bridge is located between the residences of Tagami and Osada). They searched for Osada, but the father and son were nowhere to be seen, so thinking "They must have taken the head and gone up to the capital. Let us pursue them," they entered the stable, led out two horses, mounted them and shouted "If you can stop us magnificently, then try to stop us!" However, only a few distant arrows were shot at them, and no one dared approach them closely. Genko still called out loudly "I am now sixty-three years old, have encountered battle ten times, and have never once shown my back to an enemy," rode his horse backwards as he galloped away, and finally remained at Washinosu. Kaneo-maru went up to the capital.

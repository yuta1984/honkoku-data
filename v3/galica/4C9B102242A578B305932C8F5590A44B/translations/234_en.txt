Hakusetsu Inari (White Snow Inari)

Located within the precincts of Banshō-ji Temple. It was established through religious solicitation during the Bunsei era (1818-1830). Since it is an old white fox spirit that has lived for several hundred years, it was named Hakusetsu (White Snow) Inari. Long ago, it would transform into the shape of a young girl and come to buy rice cakes and sweets, so even now it is still affectionately called "Little Miss" (O-kojorō). Every year, the festivities of the first Horse Day (Hatsuma) are so lively that they captivate the entire southern part of the castle town.

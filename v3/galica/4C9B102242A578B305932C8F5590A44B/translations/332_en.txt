Agui (Agui-no) Shrine《Marginal note: Located in Hiemiya Village. Commonly called Hachiman. Also called Ichinomiya》This is the Agui Shrine mentioned in the Engi-shiki and the Agui Tenjin of Junior Second Rank mentioned in the Honkoku-chō. The reason it is called Ichinomiya is that in the Shinmei-shiki, this shrine was placed first among the three shrines of this county. This is likely why the title Ichinomiya arose. Considering the village name, since the Japanese reading of hie (barnyard millet) is "hie," at some point Eihi was mistakenly written with the character for hie.

Yahi Tenjin Shrine《Marginal note: Located in Yaguchi Village. Now called Kumano. This is the Yahi Tenjin of Junior Third Rank mentioned in the Honkoku-chō. The current shrine was repaired by the provincial lord in medieval times》

Hōō-zan Heisen-ji Temple《Marginal note: Located in Tsunooka Village. Called Engetsu-bō. A branch temple of Noda Mitsuzō-in of the Tendai sect》The exact year and month of this temple's founding are not clear. The founder was Hōin Shukei. It is said that it was formerly called Daijō-bō. Also, on old ridge plates, it appears as Heiraku. Perhaps the character "sen" (spring) in Heisen was mistakenly written as "raku" (pleasure). According to tradition, on August 15th of Bunji 6 (1190), Right General Minamoto no Yoritomo stayed at this temple and was admiring the moon at the Amida Hall when he asked the name of the temple. Shukei immediately replied "Daijō-bō," whereupon the Right General said, "There is nothing to obstruct the clarity of the moon, it shines clearly..."

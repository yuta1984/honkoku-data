"Though the fragrance that returns souls is present, how sad that the past cannot linger on my sleeves."
When he composed this poem, the monk also replied:
"Who would have thought that keeping the fragrance of a flower's form, one should see her in the midst of smoke."
From that time on, this mound came to be called the Soul-Returning Mound (Hankon-zuka). The details are recorded in the temple chronicle, but since the account is lengthy, it is omitted here.

Now, while such a legend exists, there are major and minor discrepancies with the chronicle of the Seven Temples, making it difficult to establish certainty. Therefore, I now present the essentials of both accounts to serve future research.

Moreover, since there are no people who know this method, it is extremely rare that this name has not perished here.》

By Okada Shinkawa:
"The horse-mane burial mound still remains beside the desolate ancient road. Occasionally encountering days of moon viewing, I imagine from afar the years of soul-returning.

By Shibayama Tōran:
"Just when spring's glory is about to end, fallen flowers and fragrant grass mourn Princess Fuji. Recalling past events, how could there not be..."

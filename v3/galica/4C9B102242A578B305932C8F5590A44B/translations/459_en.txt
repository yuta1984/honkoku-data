When this happened, the patron of Kōmyōji Temple thought it very admirable and inquired about the teachings of nembutsu and other matters. Eventually he took refuge in Saint Ippen, became a follower of the Ji sect, and took the name Bon Amidabutsu. He revered Saint Ippen as the founder of the temple's revival. To this day, it has been thirty-four generations. Outside the gate, beside the shrine of Mishima Myōjin, there is an ancient enoki (hackberry) tree from olden times. When Toyotomi Hideyoshi was young, he entered this temple to practice calligraphy, and in his spare time he would play with the village children under that enoki tree. Even when he reached adulthood, he did not forget the pleasures of his childhood and called himself Kinoshita, as has been passed down through the oral tradition of the temple monks. Also, at the beginning of the Tenbun era, there was a monk called Fukuami at a branch temple under Kōmyōji who was skilled at treating eye diseases. Emperor Go-Nara summoned him to treat his illness, and when His Majesty recovered, he was called upon from time to time. Later, for certain reasons, he was granted a court lady, whom he brought back to his home province. He returned to lay life, moved his residence to Nakamura in Aichi District, and called himself Yasuke. The child born to that court lady was none other than Hideyoshi. Therefore, he was sent to Kōmyōji Temple to practice calligraphy. [omission] ○Principal Buddha Image: Amida Nyorai

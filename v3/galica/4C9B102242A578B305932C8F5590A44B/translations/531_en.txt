《Side note: is erected. This is called nyoi (wish-fulfilling pillar). In the middle level there is children's music《Side note: only flutes and drums, no dancing}}. At the front of the lower level, two cart attendants wearing kamishimo formal dress sit on portable camp stools. The places that produce these danjiri are Kome-no-za, Tōge, Ikadaba, Ima-ichiba, Shimogamae, etc. Originally, this divine festival began when the revered deity came from the western sea to this place and was pleased by the innocent play of grass-cutting children who loaded basket-like objects on small boats, hung hand towels on the tips of poles, and played flutes. From this, they created this form to comfort the divine spirit. This is recorded in Mano Tokitsuna's "Record of the Tsushima Festival." Another theory states that when Prince Yukinaga's son Prince Yoshitaka, grandson of Emperor Go-Daigo, was hiding in Tsushima, a resident of Saya named Daijiri Ōsumi-no-kami plotted to kill the prince. The imperial loyalists sensed this and used the night's boat festival as a pretext to devise a plan and destroy Ōsumi-no-kami. The phrase "killed Daijiri, celebrate!" from that time became the origin. This appears in the Namiai-ki. Though there are many boat festivals in the world, those with proper historical precedent like this place are rare. First, regarding the number of lanterns: the twelve lanterns of the central pillar represent the months of the year, the 360 horse curtain lanterns symbolize the number of days, and the thirty silk lanterns arranged around the four sides of the structure represent the days in a month. The "Investigation of Annual Events and Historical Practices" records: "The practice of transporting festival floats by boat exists nowhere else in the provinces, being unique to Tsushima, making it the nation's foremost spectacle." This appears in "Annual Events of All Provinces," printed in Kan'ei 18}}
《Side note: Even Tokugen included it in his "Primer of Haikai Poetry," making it a great festival known throughout other provinces as well}} Same Day Morning Festival《Side note: On the following 15th day at the early hour of the Rabbit, the festival boats gather at the Kuruma-kawado estuary waiting for the Ichie danjiri to arrive. Now}}
《Side note: This Ichie is the place where the aforementioned grass-cutting children's historical incident occurred, so by ancient precedent the Ichie danjiri crosses first. The float decorations are generally the same as Tsushima's danjiri, but there are various historical precedents with rare ancient objects among the decorations and curtains《Side note: Details are given in the festival of Akaboshi Myōjin in Nishibo Village, Kaisai District}}. Also, on this float, ten men holding spears with silk fabric attached stand in a row, and when they reach the boat wharf, they compete to jump into the water first, climb ashore to worship at Tennō shrine, then proceed to the shrine family's house《Side note: Kawamura Ushidayū}} according to ancient custom. When the Ichie danjiri reaches the wharf, both Tsushima's danjiri and festival floats row out. The danjiri decorations are completely different from the trial performance: on the upper level, Noh dolls are placed within palace-like structures; on top of the middle-level pavilions, various kosode robes are displayed, including Chinese brocade and Yamato nishiki, all hung upside down. This is called kosode curtains and represents an ancient style. On top of the structures, artificial plum blossoms are decorated, young pines are erected at the back, and the eave decorations and lower-level large curtains all exhibit utmost beauty, creating an indescribable magnificent spectacle. The children's dress and musical accompaniment remain unchanged from the evening festival. When each danjiri reaches the wharf and finishes performing music, everyone from cart attendants to children without exception worships at Tennō shrine with music continuing to the worship hall. After these ceremonies conclude, there is a banquet ceremony between the head priest and children at the festival offering hall. Then each group departs, forms orderly lines as before, and rows back to Kuruma-kawado. The large festival float is thirteen ken high with dolls decorated on the upper level, each over seven shaku tall. These dolls hold muskets}}

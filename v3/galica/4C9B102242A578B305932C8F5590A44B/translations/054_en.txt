《Small print: but there is no time to enumerate them all, so they are omitted here》 The annual festival is held on April 15th each year, when three portable shrines are carried to the ritual hall, divine offerings are presented, on the 16th divine food offerings are prepared, and bugaku court dance and music are performed in the early morning. On the same night, there are doctrinal debates by shrine monks before the deity, and on the 17th at dawn, offerings are presented, pardoning of criminals takes place, then processional music and town guards are handed over, and thus the three portable shrines make their divine procession to the temporary shrine 《Small print: called the御旅所 (rest station)》 at Suehiro-cho. The head priest 《Small print: on horseback》, shrine monks 《Small print: in palanquins》, ten monks from affiliated temples 《Small print: on horseback》, and head priests of ten shrines in the castle town all participate in the procession, with警蹕 officials, two riders in front and two behind, and including all other officials on foot, totaling over 4,000 people, not only displaying the finest beauty and magnificence but also strict solemnity and propriety - such a procession is rarely matched elsewhere. In front of the portable shrines, musicians walk while playing music in ensemble, and along the route of the divine procession, bamboo barriers are erected on both sides to prohibit passage, with each house swept clean, making the roads straight as a whetstone and arrow-like

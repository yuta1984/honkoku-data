The inscriptions on the reverse are all written in vermillion lacquer, so about half the characters have faded and are difficult to read. However, since all the era names show the characters for Jishō, these are ancient objects dating approximately 660-plus years from today in the Tenpō era. Among them, the Ryōō mask shows "restored in Kōan 1st year," making it over 560 years old as of this year. If the other masks were also restored during the Jishō years, estimating the time of their original creation, there may perhaps be some that span a thousand years.

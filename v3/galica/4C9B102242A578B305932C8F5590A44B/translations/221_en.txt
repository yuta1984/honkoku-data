However, since this is a good friendship outside the mundane world, I dare not decline on grounds of my ordinariness. I respectfully record these few words to answer his intention and eternally propagate Master Zenshan's teachings.

The inscription says:
Shōtoku arose here, Master Zen opened the sect, established the law and expounded transformation, beginning in Mino
The law has no permanent dwelling, Nagoya now houses it, carried through the calamity of ashes, the jeweled palace renewed again
The jeweled palace governs time, the bronze sounds abundantly, warning at dawn and dusk, awakening the benighted
For hundreds of thousands of myriads of kalpas, may Shōtoku's virtuous merit endure

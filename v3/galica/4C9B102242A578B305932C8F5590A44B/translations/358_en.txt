stopped there. The burn marks still remain on the pillars today. In ancient times there were twelve sub-temples that managed this temple, but they later declined, and now only five sub-temples remain: namely Chūbō, Hashbō, Tanibō, Nanbō, and Sugibō. ○ Main Buddha (The Thousand-Armed Kannon is a sacred statue cast from jambu gold by Monju Bodhisattva, which was the protective Buddha of Yang Guifei of Tang China. For the salvation of all beings, it drifted on the ocean tides and came to this place. At that time there was an honest and single-minded man named Tōroku among the local people of Susa village, and the sacred statue appeared to Tōroku in a dream saying: "To the north of here there is a sacred site of rock caves, a pure realm where various deities manifest. Quickly move me to that place." Following this divine dream, this became that pure domain. It is designated as the first temple of the eighty-eight sacred sites established in this district in recent times, and devout pilgrims constantly visit without cease.)

Temple treasures: Complete sutras in Song edition (donated by Uemon no Jō Morimitsuin in the third year of Hōtoku), clay statue of Amida Buddha (made by Kōbō Daishi), Nirvana painting (brushwork of Chōdenji), Lotus Sutra in gold ink on dark blue paper (calligraphy of Dengyō Daishi), Amida Sutra and Heart Sutra of the same type (calligraphy of Chūjō-hime), and the staff of En no Gyōja (one branch). There are over thirty other rare items, but these are omitted. (During the Bunka era, the monk Kankai (whose name was Gōchō) resided at this temple. At that time he contributed much wealth and abundantly installed carved stone Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and even five hundred Arhat statues in the hollows of giant rocks before and behind the main hall and on the small elevated areas on the mountainside, making this a means for all beings to form connections with Buddhism. Now they are completely covered with moss, increasing their venerable appearance. This is truly the foremost pure realm of our province, and the monk's merit should be called vast. The monk was also a famous priest of recent times, whose adherence to precepts was naturally firm, who excelled in Buddhism and Confucian learning, and was skilled in calligraphy and painting. His written works are also numerous.)

Mount Ise (located in Tōtan village, this mountain faces the coast and offers the most magnificent scenery. There are many giant rocks on the beach at its foot, but the quality of stone is not the same as what is produced locally. These are rocks that Amaterasu Ōmikami playfully threw...)

Nanao Tenjin (Seven-Tailed Tenjin Shrine)

Poem by Chūfu:

The torii gates shine together,
catching the slanting sunlight.
A bronze dragon in heaven
coils around stone and spouts
clear spring water.
The autumn leaves in the garden
are all like brocade,
and divine poetic inspiration
fills the scene before one's eyes.

(Seal) Shunkō

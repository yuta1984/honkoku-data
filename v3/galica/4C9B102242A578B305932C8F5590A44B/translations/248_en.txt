Atsuta (located at the southern end of Aichi District, this village name is written as "Atsuda" in the Wamyōshō, while other ancient records all use the characters for "Atsuta." According to the Kanpyō Engi, when deliberating to establish a shrine and transfer the sacred sword, they decided upon the location for the shrine. At that location stood a single maple tree, which spontaneously burst into flames and fell into a rice paddy. The flames would not extinguish, and because that field remained hot, it was named Atsuta.)

Senior First Rank, First Class Order of Merit, Atsuta Imperial Grand Shrine: In the fortieth year of Emperor Keikō's reign, in the seventh month, the eastern barbarians rebelled against the imperial command, so Prince Yamato Takeru (initially called Prince Ousu, also known by the childhood name Yamato Okuna. From his youth he possessed a valiant spirit and imposing appearance. His height was one jō, and his strength was such that he could lift a bronze tripod. Prior to this, he had subjugated the Kumaso. The prince used clever strategy to kill a bandit leader named Kawakaminotakeru, who praised the prince and named him Yamato Takeru) received imperial orders to pacify them. He departed in the tenth month, first visiting Ise Grand Shrine, where his aunt Yamato-hime no Mikoto, who served at the Saigu, bestowed upon him the divine sword Ame-no-Murakumo and a fire-making pouch. He then crossed over to Owari. At the village of Hikami (present-day Ōtaka village in Chita District), he took as consort Miyasu-hime no Mikoto, the younger sister of Takeinada no Mikoto, and stayed there briefly. After promising future reunion, he traveled eastward and arrived in Suruga Province. There, villains plotted to burn him to death with wildfire under the pretense of hunting, and the situation became perilous. However, the divine sword spontaneously unsheathed itself and cut down the grass of the wilderness, while the fire-making pouch opened and its fire instead burned and destroyed the bandits, and the prince escaped from dire peril.

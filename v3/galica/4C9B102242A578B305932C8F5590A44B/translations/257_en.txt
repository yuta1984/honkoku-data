《Location: Atsuta Ōmiya}} Complete illustration
　　　　Part One

Among the subsidiary shrines' small sanctuaries, many were abandoned during the medieval period. Now stones are placed at those sites as markers. These are what are called "stone gods" (ishigami). However, in this illustration, even though they are abandoned shrines, all the deity names are recorded to serve as a guide for worshippers. Therefore, where there are no drawings of small shrines but only deity names shown, these should all be understood as marker names for stone gods.

《Journey to the Eastern Provinces》
This shrine is where Yamato Takeru-no-mikoto resided (etc.). He swiftly pacified the eastern barbarians, and on his return journey, at Sakaori Palace in Kai Province:

"Having passed through Niibari and Tsukuba,
　　　　　how many nights have we slept?"

A fire-tending boy replied:

"Counting together, nine nights
　　　　　and ten days"

This is said to be the beginning of linked verse (renga) (etc.). Deep within this seaside palace, the treetops evoke the age of the gods, and the evergreen that knows no frost-withering represents the eternal and imperishable—this cannot be doubted.
Etc.

(This was compiled from a printed edition of Tenna 3, year of the Water Boar) states: "Kampaku Hideyoshi's eldest son Hidetugi was the son of Musashinokami Sanmi Hōin Ichiraku, whom [Hideyoshi] adopted. In Tenshō 19, he transferred the position of Kampaku to him and had him reside in Owari Province, while he himself stayed at Jurakudai. However, Hidetugi neglected his official duties, spent his days and nights in pleasure and amusement, and his conduct was rough with only self-will, so the people spoke ill of him, and later there was even talk of treason. Since Hideyoshi's retainers Masuda Uemonno-jō Nagamori and Ishida Jibushōyū Mitsunari had long been at odds [with Hidetugi], they took advantage of this to fabricate slander and whispered from time to time. When Hideyoshi nodded in agreement, [Hidetugi] was determined to be a traitor. Though Hidetugi lamented with sacred oaths that he was without fault, the slanderers still did not cease, and finally on the 15th day of the 7th month of Bunroku 4, he committed suicide at Seigan-ji Temple on Mount Kōya."

Hikami Aneko Shrine (Located in the same village, now called Hikami Shrine. One of the seven Atsuta shrines. The enshrined deity is Princess Miyasu. This is the shrine listed as Hikami Aneko Shrine in the Engi-shiki and as Senior Second Rank Hikami Myōjin in the Honkoku-chō. The Jinnō Shōtōki and Atsuta Engi all state that she was Inatane's younger sister, but the designation "Aneko Shrine" does not arise from the argument about Inatane's sisters, but rather from calling unmarried young women "aneko" in general. When Prince Yamato Takeru went on his eastern expedition, he loved this princess at this place, and when parting, he left the sacred sword. After the Prince's death, this princess selected the shrine grounds and enshrined the sacred sword—this tradition is detailed in the section on Atsuta, so I defer to that and abbreviate it here). Originally, this shrine was moved to Kutsunugi Island during the reign of Emperor Chūai (this is called the original shrine), and in the fourth year of the same emperor's reign, it was moved again to the present location (even now there is a shrine called Asao Shrine on Kutsunugi Island, which is where this shrine's portable shrine makes its divine procession). The shrine grounds are vast, with thousand-year-old trees drooping their branches

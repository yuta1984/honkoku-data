In this area spanning several blocks, each house on both sides is engaged in preparing packed lunches and tiered food boxes for the sacred festival. They hang lanterns and light candles brightly, and the crowds of spectators - old and young, men and women, clergy and laypeople alike - continue without pause through the all-night festivities. Nothing surpasses this bustling atmosphere.

　Though summer approaches,
　　　More lively than elsewhere
　　　　　　The fish market

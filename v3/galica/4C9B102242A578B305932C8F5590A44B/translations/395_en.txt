This is it. In Kanshō 3 (1462), year of the Water Horse, Isshiki Hyōbu-shōyū renovated it. Sacred treasures: One complete set of the Great Wisdom Sutra, which had been in the temple's possession since the Jōkyū period (1219-1221), but being old, it had been damaged by insects, so in the Shōwa period (1312-1317), the monk Keikō and Mugen Kageaki repaired it.

Ogura Seaweed: Manufactured in Ogura village. This is green seaweed from these waters, and even after being well-bleached and dried, it does not lose its green color, and its taste is also superior to that produced in other villages, so what is produced in this village is called Ogura seaweed and is considered the finest quality product.

Ogura Tenjin Shrine: Located in the same village (Ogura), commonly called Sankitsune-jin (Three Fox God). This is what is listed in the provincial records as "Junior Third Rank Ogura Tenjin." However, what is called Muyama Shrine in Ōno village was the tutelary deity of both Ōno and Ogura villages, so it is uncertain whether Muyama Shrine is called Ogura Tenjin.

Ogura-san Rendai-ji Temple: Located in the same village, belonging to the Ji sect, a branch temple of Konren-ji at Shijō Dōjō in Rakuyō (Kyoto). The founding priest was Kaku-a Shōnin, and it was established by Isshiki Dōshū in Shōwa 3 (1314), year of the Wood Tiger. In Jōha's "Fuji-mi Dōki" (Record of Mount Fuji Viewing Journey), the verse "At Ogura Dōjō - how the evening tide wind penetrates the body in the morning coolness" was composed at this temple. In ancient times, the temple had extensive lands and seventeen sub-temples. At that time, Saji Suruga-no-kami ruled this district and donated temple lands, but after the Saji clan declined, these were confiscated. Also, when Oda Uraku ruled this district, he donated temple lands, but Hideyoshi again confiscated them. From then on, the temple greatly deteriorated, preserving only one sub-temple. In Keichō 5 (1600), when the Kuki clan invaded and plundered this district, it caught fire and all records and temple treasures were completely burned. Juzan-zuka (Juzan Mound): Located in front of the temple gate, this is the grave of Saji Suruga-no-kami. His Buddhist name was Sainen Juzan, hence the name. Generally, the Saji clan had lived in this district from ancient times, but they invited members of the same clan from Tamba and Kōka district in Ōmi to rule extensively and prosper. Tōtōmi-no-kami is said to have ruled lands of about 60,000 koku in Ōmi. His son Suruga-no-kami had great military prowess and came to this district to live in Ōno and Miyayama. This was Sainen Juzan. His son Kōzuke-no-suke Yoshisada, and his son Hachirou Nobumasa was the brother-in-law of Lord Nobunaga's sister and died in battle at Nagashima during the Tenshō period. Nobumasa's sister was the wife of Saji Bitchū-no-kami Korenawa, lord of Utsumi castle in this province. In Tenbun 13 (1544), in Sōboku's "Tōgoku Kikō" (Eastern Provinces Travel Record), in the section about climbing up to the castle in Ōno, Chita district, and traveling along the shore to Tokoname the next day, it says: "The Ōno people now say 'this is as far as we go' and came out - what remains resembles the capital, the parting of old friends is today's farewell."

《From Dai Nihon Shi (Great History of Japan)》
Kamada Masakiyo's wife was of the Taira clan and the daughter of Osada Shōji Tadamune. In the first year of Heiji (1159), when Minamoto no Yoshitomo was defeated in battle and attempted to flee to the Kantō region, he stopped at Owari Noma on his way and took refuge in Tadamune's house. Tadamune killed Yoshitomo and also killed Masakiyo. When the wife heard of this calamity, she went to the place of their death, grieved and mourned with sorrow and lamentation, and finally fell upon Masakiyo's blade and died.

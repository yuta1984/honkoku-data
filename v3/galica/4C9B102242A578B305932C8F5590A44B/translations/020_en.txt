Of the hundred landscapes he visits, there are none he does not collect and store away. However, he has never had a teacher; his natural talent is so exquisite that when he depicts the subtle details, it is sufficient to substitute for the Wei artist and delight the King of Yan. He can truly be called one who carves and sculpts myriad forms. Moreover, he has quite sturdy legs, and throughout the famous scenic spots and sacred places of our Owari province - the mountains and waters, shrines and Buddhist temples - there is scarcely any place his feet cannot reach. This is his third obsession. Zuisai particularly has a reputation for calligraphy.

Moreover, even during great earthquakes, the area within the sacred gates never moved at all. Also, during dozens of Shinto rituals, even in torrential rain, the rain would temporarily stop just during the performance of ceremonies - this is widely known among the people. Such purity and miraculous phenomena are all manifestations of divine power, so the reverence we feel is beyond measure. Furthermore, within the sacred precincts and outside the gates, over a thousand donated lanterns have stood in rows since ancient times. Among them, within the Kaizō Gate, there stands one large stone lantern measuring two jō and four shaku in length《The inscription reads "Donated by Sakuma Daizen-no-suke Taira no Katsuyuki in the fifth month of Kan'ei 7, year of the Metal Horse"}}. This forms a pair with one erected at Nanzen-ji Temple in Kyoto. Also, in the recent year of Bunsei 13 (year of the Metal Tiger), faithful people consulted together and dedicated over a thousand lanterns at once. They also repaired all the old tilted ones, perfecting their beauty and even arranging their positions by size and order, truly creating a magnificent spectacle that amazed all who saw it.

Divine Rank《The Nihon Kiryaku states: "In the sixth month of Kōnin 13, day of kanoe-tatsu, the rank of Ju-shi-i-ge (Junior Fourth Rank Lower) was bestowed upon Atsuta Shrine in Owari Province." The Shoku Nihon Kōki states: "In the sixth month of Tenchō 10, day of mizunoe-uma, by imperial decree, Shō-san-mi (Senior Third Rank) was bestowed upon Atsuta Ōkami of Ju-san-mi rank residing in Owari Province, together with fifteen tribute households." The Montoku Jitsuroku states: "In the tenth month of Kashō 3, day of kanoto-i, Shō-san-mi was granted to Atsuta Shrine in Owari Province《Upon examination, when Senior Third Rank was granted in Tenchō 10, the rank certificate had not yet been presented, so this rank was likely granted later》." The Sandai Jitsuroku states: "On the 27th day of the first month of Jōgan 1, day of kinoe-saru, Ju-ni-i (Junior Second Rank) was granted to Atsuta Shrine of Shō-san-mi rank in Owari Province. The same work states: In the same year, on the 17th day of the second month, day of mizunoto-u, Shō-ni-i (Senior Second Rank) was granted to Atsuta Shrine of Ju-ni-i rank in Owari Province. On the 19th of the same month, rank certificates and treasures were presented to Atsuta, Ōagata and other shrines in Owari Province. Both the Nihon Kiryaku and the oracle record of Shōō 4 record it as Shō-ichi-i Atsuta Daijingū (Senior First Rank Atsuta Grand Shrine)"}}

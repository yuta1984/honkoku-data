Now, when farmers tried to offer the first fruits of melons, eggplants, radishes and such to Atsuta Shrine, the road was far, so they placed jars in the bamboo grove of Awate Forest [note: even now the old｜form still exists]. Various people threw in all kinds of vegetables and grabbed handfuls of salt as they pleased, and these naturally mixed together to become well-seasoned pickles, which were offered to that shrine in the 2nd, 11th, and 12th months. This was named "yabu no kō no mono" (pickles of the thicket) and became a famous local product. In later times, wayfarers along the road would eat even the offerings to the gods without hesitation, and sometimes would add filthy things, so finally it was moved to the precincts of Shōbōji temple, and even to this day it is customary to offer these to Atsuta Shrine. "Yabu ni kō no mono" has a deeper meaning, as told in the Jikkinshō: At the house of Kan Sanbōn, when people were enjoying viewing the moon, someone recited "the moon climbs the hundred-foot tower." An old, suspicious-looking nun heard this and said, "What nonsense you speak! Why should the moon climb a tower? 'To the moon one climbs'—that is how the late Sanmi-dono composed it." The people were ashamed, like the saying about children who speak of "pickles in the thicket"

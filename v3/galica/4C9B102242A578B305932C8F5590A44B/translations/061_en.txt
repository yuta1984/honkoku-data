　　On the 17th in Nagoya,
　　witnessing the festival of
　　the Great Deity Tōshō

　　　　　Inakake Taihei

The grass leaves of pillows tied and abandoned,
in a world that was disordered like cut sedge mats,
from the counted province of Mikawa
most reverently appeared,
and in accordance with the Emperor's words,
cleanly governed
all lands within the four directions under heaven,
and now eternally enshrined
in the Futara shrine of Shimotsuke,
the Divine Command of Tōshō—
how awesome that as the same divine
ancestor, the white jewel lord of Owari
cherishes
the soft Nagoya
village, even at its castle

they respectfully worship and serve
with reverence, and on this
auspicious day of April
each year,
as the divine procession passes
through the great streets,
　the mikoshi shining brilliantly in the distance
is served, and all people
come to worship on this day of
great reverence.

　　Also

When the divine procession
of the Divine Command of Tōshō
arrives, so many villagers
come forth, and looking at
the festival floats
drawn out as decorative objects,
on tall pavilions where birds gather,
kagura performers
are positioned, and with each dance
of the figures, beautiful silk wraps
emerge from within the pavilions, flutes play
and resound as they pass through the bustling great streets

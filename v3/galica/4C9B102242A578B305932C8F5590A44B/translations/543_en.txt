Kiyomasa quickly perceived this, put on a red-haired demon mask, and hid inside a wicker basket containing clothes. The bandits, unaware of this, carried it away, but after carrying it about one ri, when the bandits stopped and opened the basket, he leaped out with a great shout, and while the bandits were startled, Kiyomasa cut them down with one stroke of his sword, according to temple tradition.

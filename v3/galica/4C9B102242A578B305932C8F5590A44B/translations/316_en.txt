From "Fuboku Wakashō" (Collection of Japanese Poetry)
From Ayuchi direction, boats rowing at dawn—faintly visible, waves approach the shores of Chita Bay　　Prince Nakatsukasa-kyō

From "Fuboku Wakashō"
From Ayuchi direction, the sound of oars echoes—in the morning mist of Chita Bay, a single sail disappears　　Prince Shikindaiji Nyūdō Nihon

From "Kashū" (Personal Poetry Collection)
Mooring boats at Chita Bay and gazing out, the moon rises from the blue ocean plain　　Yamada Sakiku
The Atsuta bow—spring passes into evening at Chita Bay, where mist trails across the offshore island mountains　　Isoashi
The evening waves at Chita Bay run high—even the fishermen of Iseo return, rowing back　　Rō
Through gaps in the heaven-brightening mist, the fisher-maidens of Chita Bay can be seen harvesting seaweed　　Tsutomu

Daiyūzan Gion Temple (Located in Arimatsu Village. A Sōtō Zen temple affiliated with Narumi Zuisen Temple. Founded during the Genroku era, with the monk Ninpo, 11th abbot of Zuisen Temple, as its founding priest. Originally called Endō Temple and located in Narumi Village, it was renamed Endō Temple in Hōei 3 (1706), then renamed again to its current name in Hōreki 5 (1755) when it moved to the present location. Around that time, the monk Taigan built a grass hermitage here as temporary residence and performed incantations for smallpox with proven efficacy. Later Gion Temple was established, and though it moved to Suruga Province after some years, the temple still issues protective amulets for smallpox. It is said that moss taken from the site of that former hermitage also has efficacy as protection against smallpox.)
Principal Buddha: Wooden statue of Shakyamuni
In recent years, a copy of the Buddha footprint stone from Yakushi Temple in Nara has been placed in the temple grounds, with its accompanying poem carved on a stone monument erected nearby.

Bunshō Peak (Peak of Literature) (This refers to the mountain behind Gion Temple, where Tenman Shrine is enshrined. The shrine was originally within Gion Temple grounds, but at the beginning of the Kansei era, through the initiative of temple monk Manzui, poems and literary works offered by several thousand people were buried at the summit of this mountain. In Bunsei 7 (1824), the present shrine was established above this site, with a new elevated shrine of eight-roof construction, creating a grandeur a hundred times greater than before. This was accomplished through massive financial contributions from devout believers of the locality. From this time it has been called Bunshō Peak. On the mountainside is a waterfall called Iroha Falls, which serves as the purification basin. Also, within the sacred fence stands a stone monument with a poem by Lord Reizei Tameyasu carved exactly as he wrote it. This is now recorded below to make it known to the world.)

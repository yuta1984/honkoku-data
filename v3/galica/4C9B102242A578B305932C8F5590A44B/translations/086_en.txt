In Bakin's "Kiryō Man'yūroku" (Record of Leisurely Travel), [he writes that] on summer days, the place for cooling off is Hirokōji, where there are dozens of temporary tea houses, shows, and theaters in front of Yanagi Yakushi, making it very lively. The scenery of Hirokōji from Yanagi Yakushi resembles Ryōgoku and Yagenbori in Edo.

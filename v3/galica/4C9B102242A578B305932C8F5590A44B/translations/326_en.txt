thatched with miscanthus grass. With its ancient appearance and pure temple grounds, in the morning old monks burn incense and ring bells while chanting the Mahayana Prajnaparamita sutras, and in the evening young monks sweep the grounds and sprinkle water while replacing offering flowers and devotional lamps. Laypeople rarely visit, and white clouds constantly shroud the corridors. It is truly a separate world removed from the secular realm, where even the temple and mountain names carry profound meaning in this pure spiritual境地. ○Main Buddha《Wooden statue of Shakyamuni》Branch temples《There are over forty temples in Owari and Mikawa provinces, from which the head priest rotates annually in August. Memorial tablets of successive generations of the Mizuno family are preserved. There are also graves of Mizuno Uemon-no-Dayū Tadamasa and his three sons》

Temple treasures: Temple bell《Inscribed "Donated by Zen nun Kenshō, widow of Ogawa Shimotsuke-no-Kami, in Eishō 10th year, Mizunoto-Tori"》Mouse-shaped lamp stand《Created by the second abbot Gyakuō Zen master, its craftsmanship is extremely unique》Painted and wooden images of Mizuno Kurando Sadamori《Besides these, there are very many Chinese paintings. Among them, the painting of Benzaiten is particularly by a master's hand - when hung on the wall with incense and flowers offered before it, subtle music can be faintly heard late into the night. There were many ancient documents of successive generations of the Mizuno family, but they were lost during the medieval period, and only documents copied by monk Gyūkin remain today》Several thousand relics《Said to have been obtained on the third day after cremation when Sadamori died of illness on the 18th day of the 5th month of Bunmei 19th year at the age of 51》Release pond《Located within the mountain gate, with a staff monument erected in the pond. A release ceremony is held annually on August 15th》

Ikuchi Tenjin Shrine《Located in Ikuji village, commonly called Hachiken Myōjin. The deity enshrined is Konohanasakuya-hime. This corresponds to "Junior Third Rank Ikuchi Tenjin" mentioned in the Provincial Register.

Ikuji Well《Located below Jōshō-an hermitage in the same village. The folk belief that it was dug by Kōbō Daishi is incorrect. In the preface to a poem about Jōshō-an by priest Banri, it briefly states: "In Chita District there is a village called Ikuji. Long ago, when the sacred deity of Atsuta went on an eastern campaign, he first entered this territory and became extremely thirsty while hunting"》

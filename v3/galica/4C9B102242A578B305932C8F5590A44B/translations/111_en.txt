　　　　Nothing to Attain
Spring colors of river and sky connect with mist and clouds, plum
and willow winds are fragrant, slanting beyond the eaves, above the pond
carrying a bottle, first drawing water, rinsing vessels in the altar,
good for offering flowers. In these peaceful times
following the tolerant dharma, peaceful body and mind belong to
the Buddhist house. Looking up in reverence to Kannon's great compassion,
her power is boundless, adding thoughtful blessings for many years

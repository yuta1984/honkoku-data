Preface

"Do no evil, practice all good deeds" - my work lies solely in these eight characters. Thus I am content and at peace, finding joy in the passage of time. I am but one idle person between heaven and earth. That an idle person should become involved in worldly matters - is this not also due to karmic connection? This book came to be because I acquired four obsessions. Bun'en by nature delights in reading national literature.

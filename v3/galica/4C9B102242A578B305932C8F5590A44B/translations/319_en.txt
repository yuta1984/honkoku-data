(Going out to the domain, welcoming and presenting the bridle, the lord rejoiced and restored their homestead. From this time, when the heir lord first entered the domain, it became customary to welcome, pay respects, and present the bridle. Descendants have continued this for already two hundred years, and the technique has become increasingly refined)

(The practitioners have become increasingly numerous, the streets connect, the houses adjoin each other, each household hangs crepe silk and cotton cloth, brilliant and vivid, just like flowers and willows competing in beauty, maples and chrysanthemums arranged in rows. Travelers stop in their tracks, buyers are)

(Unceasing, foreign merchants and barbarian guests who pass by inquire about Shōkurō's house, admire and gasp in wonder, and some buy dozens or hundreds of bolts before departing. Now Shōkurō is quite fond of refined elegance, soliciting poems and verses from various renowned scholars, thereby)

The cuckoo emerging brightly, its voice rare, in recent years it has become unfamiliar in the capital, and there are still many who have not heard or known it, when I happened to ask the name of this rare place, it was called Arimatsu

"Record of Uchide Beach"
The cuckoo here makes its vow, at Arimatsu the treetops are high and it cries frequently　　　　Lord Karasumaru Mitsuhide
Taking the eternal shade of evergreens as our pledge, we shall dwell for a thousand years in Arimatsu village　　　　Lord Reizei Tameaki

(In Arimatsu village, the streets face each other, neighboring houses sell tie-dyed cotton cloth. Those who pass by are persuaded and marvel in amazement, as if wandering in a flower grove, red, white, blue, and green sparkling like brocade. There was a certain Takeda who alone loved refined elegance, and whenever he saw traveling poets, he would request their verses. I composed a poem for him and wrote it as a gift)

Standing in rows like floral brocade, at every house the tie-dyed fabrics are hung

June Rice
Ano Village: The rice ripens extremely early, and in the past they would tribute roasted rice on the first day of the sixth month. Even now they present new rice to the domain lord in the sixth month. The Meireki edition of the travel record also notes "new rice emerges on the first day of the sixth month in Anō village." It is famous throughout the world as Ano's June rice and is the foremost early rice. This village also produces watermelon as a specialty, and its flavor is most delicious.

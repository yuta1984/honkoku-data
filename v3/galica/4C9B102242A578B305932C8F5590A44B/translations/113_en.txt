Ōsu Dedicated Horse Heads

The horse heads of May 18th originated when Lord Nobunaga achieved victory at the Battle of Okehazama. Upon hearing this news, the local towns throughout the province rejoiced and immediately rode horses to Kiyosu Castle, where both acquaintances and strangers alike offered their congratulations. This custom has been passed down and continues to this day. It is most flourishing in the capital area, and is also very popular in Atsuta and other rural areas. The characters are also written as "horse tower" (uma no tō) or "horse party" (uma no tō), and the character "party/faction" (tō) seems to particularly evoke the atmosphere of the Warring States period.

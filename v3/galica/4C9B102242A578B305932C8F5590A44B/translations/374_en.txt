Yashichibei and Hamada Saburo, being skilled warriors, were secretly instructed to "stab him to death," and the three men were hidden beneath the floor. On the morning of January 3rd, Tadamune appeared before Yoshitomo and earnestly suggested, "To rest from the fatigue of your recent journey, perhaps you should take a bath." Yoshitomo immediately entered the bathhouse. At this time, Kaneo-maru was attending him carrying his sword, but even after time passed, no bathrobe was brought, and since everything was poorly managed, Kaneo-maru became greatly angered and went to fetch it himself. In that moment, Hashichiro leaped out from under the floor and grappled with him, but Yoshitomo remained calm, said "I understand," seized and pinned him down under his knee. Subsequently, Yashichibei and Hamada Saburo also attacked from left and right, desperately stabbing through his sides. At this moment, before he could even say "Where is Masukiyo? Where is Kaneo-maru?" he finally passed away (at the age of thirty-eight). They then cut off his head and were handing it to their accomplice when Kaneo-maru returned. The moment he saw this scene, he cut down all three men at the entrance to the bathhouse. Masukiyo, unaware of what had happened, was drinking sake with Tadamune, but upon hearing of this event, he stood up and came out.

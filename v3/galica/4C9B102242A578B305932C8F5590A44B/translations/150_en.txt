The Ancient Tale of Biwa Island
After the daughter of the Yokoe clan parted from Minister Shichō, she poured her resentment over their separation into his keepsake biwa, and left behind this waka poem:

"Tell him that I have sunk to the bottom of Mitsuse River, my feelings tied to the tuning of these four strings"

Then she drowned herself. Thus arose the names Biwa Pond and Biwa Island. For more details, see the section on Biwajima.

Nichijun:
The deep feelings that led her to drown herself - perhaps the tender dew of white chrysanthemums became this deep pool

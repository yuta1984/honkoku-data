His moral character was firm and solid, and he disliked sleep. He practiced the Way by sitting upright day and night without distinction, so his virtue became manifest. He knew his time of death in advance and demonstrated various miraculous phenomena before passing away on the 28th day of the 2nd month of Keichō 14 (1609). Before this, the Tōshō deity (Tokugawa Ieyasu) had taken refuge in Myōrei, and Lord Tadayoshi had also deeply taken refuge in him, so he was invited to Kiyosu. After Lord Tadayoshi's death, he was called Daikōin-den, which was the posthumous Buddhist name that this priest Myōrei had bestowed upon him. Then, at the time of the relocation of the capital in Keichō 15 (1610), the temple was moved to the Hioki area of Nagoya and renamed Hiokisan Daikōin, and later the mountain name was changed again to the present one. The temple lands were donated by Lord Tadayoshi.

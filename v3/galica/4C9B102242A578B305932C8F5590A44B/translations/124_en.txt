1. Henceforth, even when reading aloud for copying purposes within the province, no more than one volume at a time shall be permitted.

1. Henceforth, monks residing in the temple shall perform service once a year during the hot season.

1. Henceforth, monks in the temple shall not secretly speak to others or lend out [the texts].

Although the above matters may seem like wrong views in appearance, this is because worldly practices face the most pressing fears of fire disasters, rodent damage, or theft. If there are holy persons within the province or district who request to read aloud for copying purposes, they may request one volume and return it, and after that volume, may request another volume. Using them continuously in this manner is permitted, but requesting many volumes at once is permanently prohibited. How much more so for requests from other provinces. If anyone violates this document, it shall be left to the judgment of the Daigyōji. The divine authority of Atsuta Daimyōjin and Yatsutsurugi Daimyōjin is strict—who would dare defy it? We respectfully make this pledge, seeking the witness and testimony of the Buddhas of the three worlds and ten directions, the dharma-protecting saints, all heavenly good deities, underworld beings, dragon gods, and demon gods recorded in the vow sutra, all united in mind.

Three-story Pagoda (Built by resident monk Ryōkai during the Genroku period. With material assistance from the provincial lord, he commissioned the Buddhist sculptor Unchō from Kyoto to carve images of the Five Wisdom Buddhas and Eight Great Bodhisattvas, which were enshrined in the pagoda. Incidentally, during the Kyōhō period, the nine-ring finial of this pagoda tilted, but at that time, an acrobat called Kirin-dayū from Nagasaki happened to be in the area. Hearing of this matter, he said he would fix it, placed a single bamboo pole against the eaves, climbed along it to reach the top in an instant, and repaired it as he pleased.)

Chinju Fifteen Shrine Complex (Tenmangū is also enshrined here. The inscription by Kōbun-in Hayashi Shunjō is carved on the stone lantern in front of the shrine) Benzaiten Shrine (Built by Yoshizawa Kengyō Kōichi in Tenna 2nd year. Every year on October 15th, blind musicians from kengyō and kōtō ranks down to the local blind perform Heike recitations in the guest hall. The plaque on the torii gate is written by the Korean Setsugetsu-dō.)

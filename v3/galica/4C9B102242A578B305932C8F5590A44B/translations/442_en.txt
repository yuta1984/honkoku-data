(In "Moshiogusa" it says "At Kayazu Plain there are puppet performers, this too is their dwelling place," so this "ako" (puppet woman) was likely a puppet performer from Kayazu inn.)

Awade Forest (located in Kami-Kayazu village) has many excellent poems by ancient poets. The dark, dense ancient forest sees no sunlight, the dew beneath the trees surpasses even rain, human footsteps are rare, and bird calls create a lonely, sublime landscape. "Moshiogusa" mentions Owari, and "Meisho Hōgaku-shō" records: "Awade Forest exists in the coastal village. It is south of the village called Shimotsu. It is also included in 'Kenpō Meisho.'" It is also written as Awade-tsutsumi, Awade, or Awaden.

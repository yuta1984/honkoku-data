In the twelfth year, on the day of mizunoe-uma, the deities Hiwari-miko-no-kami, Hikowaka-miko-no-kami, and Takakuramusubi-miko-no-kami of Owari Province—
a total of three deities—were entrusted as myōjin (famous deities). It appears that they are also child deities of the Great Deity of Atsuta, and in the marginal notes of the Jinmyōchō (Register of Deities), 
it is recorded that Hiwari-miko of Ayuchi District in Owari Province is Prince Takatsuzumi, the fifth son of Prince Yamato Takeru. 《There is a torii gate for the distant worship hall of Hikami Shrine to the south of the precinct. The main shrine is located in Ōtaka Village, Chita District》

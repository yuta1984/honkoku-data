Hakuun-san Enzō-ji Temple《Located in Susa Village. A Tendai sect temple affiliated with Mitsuzō-in Temple in Noda Village. Founded in the fifth year of Tenchō (828), it is a very ancient Buddhist temple》Principal Buddha《Eleven-faced Kannon》

Susa Inlet《Located at the seaside of Susa Village, with Mount Osa to the east and the land of Susa extending long to the south forming an inlet to the west》Also called "Karumo-ga-ura" or sometimes "Arai." The "Ruiji Meisho Waka-shū" (Classified Collection of Famous Places in Poetry) lists it as a famous place in Settsu Province, but in Keichū's "Shōchi Tokai-hen" (Thoughts on Famous Places), there is an argument that Susa Inlet is a place name in the eastern provinces. The poem "When winter ends, at Susa Inlet..." is thought to reference from the Azuma-uta (Eastern Songs) in Book 14 of the Man'yōshū: "At Susa Inlet where aji fish dwell, in the hidden marsh..." Since these are Eastern Songs, it is not in Settsu Province. Book 11 also contains the verse "At Susa Inlet where aji fish dwell, the rocky shore pines..."

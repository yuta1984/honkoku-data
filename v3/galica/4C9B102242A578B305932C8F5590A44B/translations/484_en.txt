Since the clay statue of Daishi performed the ritual in his place, it was called "Migawari no Daishi" (Substitute Daishi). When this sacred statue was enshrined in the inner sanctuary of Atsuta, the Great Deity told Daishi: "To the northwest of here lies a sacred place. If you move this statue to that location, the karmic connections with all sentient beings will become vast." When Daishi looked toward the northwest, he saw a five-colored radiance. Following that light to investigate, he found it was the forest of Takasuka.

Since ancient times, this forest had been home to numerous poisonous wasps that troubled many people. Using his spiritual power, Daishi bound these poisonous wasps with sacred spells and made them into a single mound, after which wasps no longer stung people. From that time, this place was called Hachizuka (Wasp Mound), but eventually the pronunciation became corrupted and it came to be commonly called Hachisuka.

Now, when the temple was first established and they dug a well for sacred water (akka), the well emitted light and they excavated a five-pronged ritual bell (goko-rei). The pure water that gushed forth from the well overflowed to form a pond, and in a single night white lotus flowers bloomed in profusion, their extraordinary fragrance wafting in all directions. Thus arose the name Chireisan Rengeji (Pond-Bell Mountain Lotus Temple). For more detailed information, I defer to the printed temple origin records.

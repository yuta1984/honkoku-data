Minami Shingu Festival
　Grand Festival Float Performance
The grand float has a small shrine structure on the upper tier, with
a large pine tree five ken tall erected
at the back. On the next tier, various
dolls are displayed and perform
mechanical movements. In total, this float
consists of seven tiers

assembled together. From the small shrine
tier down to the bottom tier,
the total height is over twelve ken.
The wheel axle opening is four shaku five sun,
and the thickness is one shaku one sun. Each doll is about seven shaku tall. Also,
a large sea bream decoration is
hung on the side of the fourth tier, and a large snake decoration
emerges from the second tier. In front of the bottom tier, young men called
yokogami stand in line to signal
the speed control for pulling, and similarly on the left, right, and
rear there are strong men called osamoto who
use levers and such to control the float's advance and retreat.

Also, the rope used to pull this float is two shaku thick
and fifty fathoms long. The car-raku has an upper tier
where curtains create a mountain shape, and above that
there is a stage with sarugaku puppet figures placed on it.
A pine is erected above, and below, artificial
peach blossoms are inserted. On the front of the pavilion, helmets
and swords are displayed. The middle tier's four corner
pillars are wrapped with damask, and on the front
pillars, both sides are
decorated with quivers. Specifically, at this
location, children perform dances.
Also, at the very front of the grand float,

one child acting as sword-bearer
rides in a decorated palanquin to visit the head priest's house.
This is an ancient festival ritual, and
the elegant, classical atmosphere that remains
unchanged to the present day is truly worth seeing.

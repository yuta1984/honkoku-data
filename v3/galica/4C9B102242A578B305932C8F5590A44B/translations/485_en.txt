Poem by Isogai Soshu:
The sea master's traces spread to the ends of the earth / This place shows especially auspicious signs / The vajra has spiritual power, once emerging from water / The cinnabar bees are harmless, still flocking to flowers / Three springs' gatherings attract both clergy and laity / Five nights' incense practice protects the nation / Since serving in office I have little leisure / When shall I ascend again and call for my carriage?

Poem by Mushotoku:
The lotus temple surpasses Gion / Tree colors verdant, rain and dew abundant / The sacred ground for a thousand years retains the clay statue / Generation after generation the winds serve the True Word / In the forest the wasp mound none recognize / Outside the hall the bell pond still exists / Long ago I dwelt in this mountain retreat / Ascending, I think solely of the founder's benevolence

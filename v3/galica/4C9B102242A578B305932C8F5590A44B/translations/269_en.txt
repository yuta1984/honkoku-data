Visiting the place called Atsuta Shrine (omitted section) - it is a place with a divine and deeply interesting atmosphere. In playing music as an offering, following the wind the sound of instruments becomes even more beautiful

From "Journey to Eastern Barriers"
We arrived at Atsuta Shrine in Owari Province (etc.) During the reign of Emperor Ichijō, there was a scholar named Ōe no Masahira. At the end of the Chōhō era, when he came down as governor of this province, he copied the Great Prajñāpāramitā Sutra and completed its dedication at this shrine. In his prayer text he wrote, "My wish has already been fulfilled, my term of residence is also complete. The time when I shall return to my homeland is now not far off" - this sounds pathetic and forlorn

Would people return without any memories? One must not fail to leave behind mementos of the Dharma

I pray earnestly for what I wish - may the tides that ebb and flow at Narumi Bay follow the divine will　　Abutsu

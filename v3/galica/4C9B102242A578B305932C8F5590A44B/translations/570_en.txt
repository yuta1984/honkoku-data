She steadfastly practiced Buddhist austerities, yet for Zenroku she would cook and serve even live fish, never showing the slightest sign of reluctance, finding her only pleasure in her parent's joy. Without thinking that she was performing filial duty through such devotion, she served him earnestly year after year with such dedication that Zenroku was moved by Soyo's filial devotion. In his old age, he would shed tears and joyfully tell others about it. When this situation somehow came to the attention of the local lord, the Shimizu family, from the spring of Anei 3 (1774) her residence taxes were forgiven, and when the domain lord also heard of it, he bestowed much money upon them. At this time Zenroku was seventy-five and Soyo was forty-five years old. For more details, I defer to the published work "Biography of the Filial Daughter Soyo" written by Nishikawa Kikusō, and omit them here.

The Biography of the Loyal Woman Haru (There is a monument standing alongside the monument to the filial daughter Soyo of the same village, in front of Mirokuji Temple)
She was born to a farming family in Uruura Village of the same district. At age twenty-six, she entered service in the household of Nishikawa Jinsuke of Torigachi Shinden in the same district, becoming a wet nurse. Her character was pure and loyal, and her care and nurturing were extremely thorough. Even after several decades, her loyalty remained unchanged. People of virtue frequently offered words of praise, lauding her devotion. During the Kyōwa era (1801-1804), her good name finally reached the government offices, and she was granted five kan-mon of coins. On the sixteenth day of the first month of Tenpō 2 (1831), at the venerable age of eighty-four, she died of illness at the Nishikawa house. That same summer, her virtues were carved in stone to transmit her excellence for posterity. For details, I defer to the monument inscription and abbreviate here.

The Wisteria Arbor (Located in the garden of Takeda Sawaemon, headman of Moritsu Shinden Village)
This wisteria grows from a single root and is only about a hundred years old, but through dedicated cultivation the arbor extends twenty-five ken in length and width on all four sides, with additional sprawling vines and a separate nodular arbor extending over six ken. The arbor is approximately two ken in height, and the flower clusters range from four to five shaku to about one ken in length. When it blooms in late spring and fills the arbor, even in broad daylight not an inch of sky can be seen. Looking up at it, it appears as if covered by purple clouds, and one thinks that even the Weaver Girl's heavenly loom could not match this. Truly, such a magnificent

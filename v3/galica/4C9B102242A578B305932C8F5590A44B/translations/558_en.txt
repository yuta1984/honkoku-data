True Illustration of the Renri Chrysanthemum

In the front garden, for the sake of chrysanthemums, I entrust my poetic soul - strange varieties grow abundantly
The grace of rain and dew makes the flowers control declining years, opening the realm of longevity
The immortal medicine of Penglai happens to share the same root

Tōka (Foot-Stamping Song) Ritual

On the 11th day of the first month at the hour of the horse, shrine attendants each gather at the mandokoro (administrative office). Ten dancers wear crowns with artificial cherry blossoms inserted, and ten assistant attendants wear artificial yamabuki (Japanese rose) flowers. These are the ones who play flutes and keep time with shaku (ceremonial batons). First, they sing saibara (court music) in front of the Chinkōmon gate, and when finished, they process through the Kaizōmon gate into the main shrine where the uzue-no-mai (halberd dance) is performed. When this dance is completed, one assistant attendant wears a tall kōshi (court cap)

and brings out a furi-tsuzumi (pellet drum). At that time, the liturgical priest recites the tōka eulogy (this is commonly called the "berobero festival"). When this ceremony ends, Miyafuku Dayū performs the okina (old man) dance. Also, the head priest serves at Daifukuda with musical accompaniment.

　Castle tower among the clouds
　　　Matsudaira Kunzan

《Heisō-shū (Humble Broom Collection)》
A jeweled tower rises high, spanning the colored clouds,
Auspicious vapors open, glowing yellow in the mid-heaven.
Swans circle, forming a path for ascending and viewing—
Good for composing poetry; in heaven and earth we have
The talent of our party's Zhongxuan


　Part Two

《Suzuya-shū (Bell House Collection)》
　Resting on a straw pillow, suddenly unaware of the height,
　Looking back at the tall palace,
　It appears high indeed
　in the clouds. Which fish of the great sea
　is wise? Even the sachi fish,
　　though not dwelling in the ocean sky,
　　serves this palace, flying from the sea plains
　　across the heavens, and like scales
　　on the roof tiles of the summit's left and right sides,
　settles like the sea. On windy days and quiet nights alike,
　casting aside all else, serving eternally. Seeing this, truly excellent—
　our lord who rules
　this land of Owari, his august majesty
　is so remarkable that even travelers on the jeweled road
　look up in surprise,
　　　　　　their eyes sparkling,
　　　　　　　　　truly awe-inspiring.

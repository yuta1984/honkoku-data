Tennō Festival Decorative Floats

In the neighborhoods around here, from the first day of the sixth month, when they worship Gozu Tennō, they create elaborate temporary decorative displays for this unique night festival unlike any other. One amusing novelty involves dozens of naked men wearing only dark blue loincloths crowded into a large sake barrel, lying face-down upside down with their buttocks raised up in a row, with a sign reading "Fresh broad beans available" and similar displays.

Kyokutei Bakin drew a picture of these "broad beans" in his travel record (Man'yūroku), writing that even Edo's night shrine festival displays cannot match this.
What is illustrated here shows the thirty-three Kannon temples copied, and instead of regular incense, sawdust is burned as mosquito repellent - this too is quite amusing.

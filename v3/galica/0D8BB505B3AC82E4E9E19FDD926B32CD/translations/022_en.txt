He goes away. Just then, a young man who is a friend appears - he too had been targeting that same girl from before, but seeing this situation now, he feels frustrated. Waiting for the right moment when his friend was off guard, his friend had quickly won over a new woman, and now that she has someone else, it's no use pursuing her. His infatuation turns to resentment, and though it's not like the autumn-waiting insects, it's natural that he would feel bitter about it.

　　　　　　　Fireflies

The summer insects that make no sound but only burn their bodies - what goes unspoken weighs heavier than words. Following the same longing, like the garden's flowing water around the artificial hills of love, with stealthy steps and heart soaring, using the fireflies flitting along the stepping stones as his guide through the darkness of desperate love. He hides near the veranda edge, tapping gently on the wooden flooring of the veranda as a signal. The daughter of this house, who had been waiting in hiding since earlier, quietly approaches with careful movements. In the faint light of the firefly cage, they barely glimpse each other's faces. "You came so stealthily, thank you." "You waited so well for me too." They clasp hands together, their hearts pounding, but the man quietly slips onto the veranda, pushing forward and groping ahead, his searching hands catching on the red silk crepe of her undergarments.

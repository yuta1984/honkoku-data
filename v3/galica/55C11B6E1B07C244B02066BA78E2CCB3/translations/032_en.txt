○The quail (uzura) is about the size of a brown-eared bulbul, with a round shape. Its entire body has fine spots. There are two varieties: reddish and blackish. It calls at the end of autumn. People appreciate this voice and often keep them in cages. They prefer to eat millet. When roasted and eaten, they supplement the five organs and benefit the body's interior.

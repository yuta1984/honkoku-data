○The tea ceremony has existed since ancient times, but it was Sen no Rikyū who began the detailed establishment of formal rules, from calling tea pavilions "sukiya" to the methods of planting vegetation and even cooking. Furuta Oribe, Kobori Enshū and others were masters of the tea ceremony, with various schools of their own. It serves as an aid in understanding human relationships and proper behavior. Originally, the tea ceremony is said to have the fundamental principle of eliminating extravagance and being based on respect and reverence.

○For rikka (formal flower arrangement), Ikenobō, the superintendent of Kyoto's Rokkakudō temple, is the master of rikka. Every year on July 7th, disciples gather to create arrangements, and people of all social ranks come to view them. Also, there are teachers of nageire (informal flower arrangement) in various places, and nowadays nageire is primarily practiced with many flower gatherings. This is quite reasonable. Since flowers console people's hearts and dispel melancholy, it is a good practice, and it is only natural that it becomes an enjoyment for people regardless of their social status.

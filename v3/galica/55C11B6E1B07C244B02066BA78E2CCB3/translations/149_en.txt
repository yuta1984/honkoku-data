○Yamabushi are also called Shugendō practitioners. This is a practice of the Shingon sect. They undergo spiritual training to discipline their bodies, and also climb high mountains and great peaks to perform ascetic practices. They constantly study astronomy and the study of divination, fortune-telling people's luck and the eight trigrams, considering palm reading for good and bad fortune, the severity of illnesses, and the direction of lost objects. There is also a branch that practices the methods of En no Gyōja, called the guides of practitioners. They pray for people's illnesses. There are purification grounds called "koriba," which are referred to as "gyōja-bori."

○Hawks have been prized in China since the time of the Five Emperors. Their introduction to our country began when Baekje first presented hawks during the reign of Empress Jingū. Later, during the reign of Emperor Nintoku, hawks were presented from Tang China, so imperial hunts were organized and various birds were caught. This was the beginning of hawk hunting. Since hawks are spirited and courageous birds suitable for military purposes, it is natural that they are prized by the warrior class.

Birds 《This section records all birds that live in mountains and forests without omission》

○The phoenix is a divine bird.
The male is called hō, and the female is
called ō. Its form
resembles a chicken. Its feathers have five
colors, its height is four to five
shaku, and its voice is like a shō flute.
It does not peck at living creatures, does not
step on living grass, prefers paulownia trees,
and eats bamboo seeds.
Phoenix and zuien are the same thing.

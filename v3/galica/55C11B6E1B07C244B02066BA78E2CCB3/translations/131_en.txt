○Golden lantern (kitsune-no-kamisori, fox's razor) is called sekisan (Lycoris radiata), and is the "corpse flower." It is also called kitōkei (demon lantern stand) and manjushage (red spider lily). It blooms with red flowers at the end of autumn. The stem is like an arrow shaft, therefore it is called "single branch arrow" (isshisen).

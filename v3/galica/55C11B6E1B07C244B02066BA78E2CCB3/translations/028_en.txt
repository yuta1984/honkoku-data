○Hawk (taka) is a general term, and there are many varieties, large and small, all being valiant birds. Using them for field hunting to catch various birds is said to have begun when Baekje first presented hawks as tribute during the reign of Empress Jingū. Since then, hawks have been cherished by successive generations. Hawks from Korea are considered the finest.

○The peregrine falcon (hayabusa) is the sharpest among hawks. Its form is also large, about the size of a kite, so it catches large birds such as pheasants, wild geese, and ducks. For cranes and such, they say two peregrine falcons are used. The jun is similar.
○The sparrowhawk (hashitaka) is a small type of hawk. The small sparrowhawk is called ko-nori. The even smaller one is called tsumi-taka. Since they are all small in form, they [catch] small birds.

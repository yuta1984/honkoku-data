○The fox resembles a dog but
has a pointed nose and large tail.
It hides during the day
and comes out at night. When it holds
horse bones in its mouth and blows, it emits light
to seek food. This is called
fox fire. It is also said that it holds
a jewel in its mouth to create light.
It is said that after living a hundred years,
it worships the Big Dipper and
gains transformative powers.

○The cat's pupils are like thread during
the hours of ne-uma-u-tori
(rat-horse-rabbit-rooster), like a full moon during
the hours of tora-saru-mi-i (tiger-monkey-snake-boar),

and like jujube seeds during the hours of ushi-hitsuji-tatsu-inu
(ox-sheep-dragon-dog). The nose is
always cold. Only on the day of
summer solstice does it become warm.

○Among tanuki, there are kori and cat-
tanuki. Cat-tanuki smell bad and
should not be eaten. Those with pointed heads
and square mouths are called kori.

○Kaku resembles
fox-tanuki. Its fur is yellow and
brownish in color. It sleeps well, lies down during the day
and comes out at night.

○Tan resembles a dog with a pointed
mouth, black feet, and brownish
fur. Its tail and legs are short,
and it walks slowly. Its ears are
deaf and it fears humans.

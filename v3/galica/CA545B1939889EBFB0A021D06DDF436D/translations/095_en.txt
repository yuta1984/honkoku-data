Various Heavenly Bodies

Sun Wheel (Nichirin)
In the lexicon, "Surina" refers to the sun wheel. The Zōtenchijō Scripture states that Buddha caused Hōō Bodhisattva to create the sun. The Hakukotsu states that the sun's diameter is one thousand ri, its circumference is three thousand ri, and it is seven thousand ri below heaven.

Moon Wheel (Gachirin)
The Myōgi Collection states that "Soma" refers to the moon deity. The Zōtenchijō Scripture states that Buddha caused Kisshō Bodhisattva to create the moon.

Big Dipper (Hokuto)
The Analects call it the North Star (Hokushin), while astronomical records call it the North Pole. The great star palace extends 720 ri around, the middle star 480 ri, and the small star 120 ri.

Venus/Morning Star (Myōjō)
The morning star appears in the interval between day and night when the moon has already hidden and the sun has not yet appeared, representing the complete essence of light and dark as non-dual, delusion and enlightenment as one. Thus, combining the two characters, the character for "bright" (明) places sun and moon side by side, so the two characters of "morning star" encompass the three lights.

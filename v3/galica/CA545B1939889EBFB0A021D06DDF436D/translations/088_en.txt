Kōshin Shōmen Kongō (Blue-faced Vajra)
In the Laozi Sanshi-kyō (Three Corpses Sutra), from the time a person is born, there are beings called "three corpses" that never leave the body and seek to harm one's life. On kōshin nights, they report sins to heaven. Also, by staying awake and calling the names of the three corpses, calamities are removed and fortune comes. After midnight, facing south, bow twice and say: "Upper corpse also Pengsu blue color, middle corpse white color, lower corpse also Pengqiao red color, Penghou-shi, Pengchang-shi, Meiying-shi" - this should be chanted three times.

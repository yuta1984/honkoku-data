This is the gandharva, father of the ten rakshasas.
Godō-ten (Five Paths Heaven)

The Kenshōron states: "Perfect and complete medicine, also Kishibojin (Hariti). Regarding Kishibo, the Myōgi says 'Kōmyō' and refers to 'Karittei (Hariti).'"
Kishibo-jin holds the auspicious fruit. According to one interpretation, "the name Enshi is called Higamaru."

The Ten Rakshasas:
First, Ranba (Lambā)
Manifestation of Akshobhya Buddha of the East (the secret teachings are the same, this is Annen's interpretation)
The Shōhokke explains this as "binding"
In the Hokke secret teachings, "Ranba represents the eight petals of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus" (and so forth)

Second, Biranba (Vilambā)  
Manifestation of Kekainya Buddha of the South (secret teachings the same)
Kashō's Gisho translates this as "separation from binding." The Shōhokke agrees with this.

Third, Kyokushi (Crooked Teeth)
Amida Buddha of the West (secret teachings the same)
In the Shōhokke, this is named "Accumulated Giving"

Fourth, Hanashi/Keshi (Flower Teeth)
Amoghasiddhi Tathagata of the North (secret teachings the same)  
In the Shōhokke, this is named "Giving Flowers"

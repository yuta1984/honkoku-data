Sahaja Devas (Kushōjin)
These are the two devas of "same-birth" and "same-name" as described in the Avatamsaka Sutra. In the Gandavyuha chapter, it states: "Born from humans, there are two kinds of devas that constantly attend and guard."

Hag of Sōzu River (Sōzugawa no Uba)
Her height is sixteen jō, and her eyes are like cart wheels. She dwells at the Sanzu River and is called Datsueba (Clothes-Stripping Hag). There is a male called Ken'eō (Clothes-Hanging Old Man). When the old hag strips the clothes from the deceased, the old man receives them and hangs them on the Eryōju tree.

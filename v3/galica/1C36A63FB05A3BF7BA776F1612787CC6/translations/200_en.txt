This was an imperial donation by Emperor Shomu. Also, the seated statue of Shakyamuni Buddha of joroku size (the shaku measure for joroku uses the Tang small shaku, where one shaku equals 6 sun, 6 bu, and 6 rin of the curved ruler) in the Shakado Hall, along with the two flanking attendant bodhisattvas on the left and right, and the ancient statue of Shakyamuni above the tower gate, are all said to have been donated by this emperor.

The restorer of the temple was Houin Eikai (died on the 24th day of the 11th month of Kanei 18). ○ (Temple records mention placing a Ruri sacred statue one jo tall, while the Shoku Nihongi records an Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva statue one body tall, seven shaku high)

According to the Shoku Nihongi: In the 12th month of Jinki 5, sixty-four cases containing 640 volumes of the Konkomyo Sutra were distributed to the provinces, ten volumes per province (omitted). On the day the sutras arrived, immediate recitation was ordered. In the 3rd month of Tempyo 9, an imperial edict commanded each province to create one Shakyamuni Buddha statue and two flanking bodhisattvas, while also copying one complete set of the Daihannya Sutra in ten volumes. In the 9th month of year 12, each province was to create one Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva statue seven shaku tall and copy the Kanzeon Sutra. In the 1st month of year 13, the family of the late Grand Minister Fujiwara no Asomi returned 5,000 households of sustenance grants; 2,000 households were returned to the family, and 3,000 households were donated to provincial temples to fund the creation of joroku Buddha statues. In the 3rd month, each province's monasteries were granted 50 households and 20 cho of paddy fields, while nunneries received 10 cho of paddy fields. These temples must maintain twenty monks, and their temple name shall be "Konkomyo Shitenno Gokoku-no-tera" (Golden Light Four Heavenly Kings Nation-Protecting Temple). Nunneries must maintain ten nuns, and their temple name shall be "Hokke Metsuzai-no-tera" (Lotus Sutra Sin-Eliminating Temple). The two temples should be situated apart and properly receive religious instruction; if there are vacancies, they should be immediately filled. These monks and nuns must perform sutra recitation on the 8th day of every month.

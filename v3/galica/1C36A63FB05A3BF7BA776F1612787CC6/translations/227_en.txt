How could this be? I think they are saying it refers to houses by the rice fields (tadzura). If that were so, one should also be able to call mountain villages "yama-i" (mountain wells) and coastal villages "ura-i" (bay wells), yet not one such example can be heard - why is this? In all cases, reading the character "居" as "wi" refers to the "i" of tachi-i (standing and sitting). The "i" of "residence" should be read as "sumai" (dwelling). <<Reading it as "moshi" and having cases where "to" fits and doesn't fit is a common occurrence. I don't recall whether the character "i" was read as "sumai" in ancient times, but as a stem word, that would be the appropriate meaning.>> There is no reason it should be read as "wi". This is a forced explanation by those who don't understand what a "moto-i" (original well/foundation) is. If we cannot explain things by treating "i" as dug wells, is this limited only to "ta-i" (field wells)? One might lodge at "Asuka-i," and drawing water from "seka-i" with a dipper doesn't sound particularly awkward either. In the phrase "the mountain well that grows muddy from the drops of cupped hands," there is no way to cup the water of a dug well in one's hands, nor would it become muddy from drops. More than the small sedge of "hashiri-i" (running well), could sedge really grow at the bottom of a dug well? If we understand these as ponds and channels, there are no obstacles whatsoever. Now, this word "ta-i" - did people in later ages come to understand and compose poems thinking it simply meant "rice fields"? It was even included in poetry anthologies. In the Zoku-Senzai-shū: "Drawing and dividing the mountain stream water..."

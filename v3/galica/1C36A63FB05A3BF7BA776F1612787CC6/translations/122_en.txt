Although there was nothing particular about this matter, the establishment of both provincial temples appears to have been from early times, and the same text records: "Jinki 5, 12th month, day ji-chū, sixty-four bundles of the Golden Light Sutra totaling 640 volumes were distributed to all provinces, ten volumes per province. Tenpyō 12, 6th month, day kō-jutsu, each province was to have ten sets of the Lotus Sutra and build seven-story pagodas." This suggests it was already determined before this time. Now, regarding this mirror, the characters "katsu" written as ■, "bun" as ■, "satsu" as ■, and "sai" as ■ - these variant character forms do not appear to be contemporary, as someone has said. This requires further careful consideration. 《This shrine is now known as Suzumori Hachiman, a small shrine within the Zenshōji temple grounds. The mirror is said to have been deposited at Sengen Shrine for certain reasons.》

○Chiba-no-suke Kunitane (sometimes written as Kunitane) was the eldest son of Tanetomi. Initially called Shin-suke, he later inherited and took the title Chiba-no-suke. On the first day of the fifth month of Tenshō 13 (1585), year of the wood rooster, he was stabbed by his retainer Kuwata Mangorō, and on the fifth day of the seventh month of that year, he finally died from his wounds at age twenty-nine. He was buried at Shōin-ji in Ōsakura village. His posthumous Buddhist name was Kesshin Jōrin-hō Amida Butsu (alternatively, Kairakuin-den An-seishō-gan), as recorded in the Chiba Great Genealogy, Records of Ancient Battles in Kantō, Sakura Local Records, and other sources.

○In the Hondo-ji death register: "7th day, Chiba-no-suke Kunitane, Kuwata Magōgorō went mad and slashed his forehead"

Kanke Bunso (Sugawara no Michizane's Literary Collection)
　Moved by the Seidian Ceremony at Sanuki Holy Temple
Each approach and bow, my heart heavy as mud
The ritual vessels sparse and simple, the ceremonial usage bewildering
After the three offerings in the dawn rain and spring wind
Were it not for this sacred worship, surely children would be crying

The above various rice fields and dry fields are private domains inherited by Tanesada. However, these various temple positions are truly being permanently granted to Chūzan-dō's licensed master, Great Assistant Ācārya Nichiyū. He should earnestly dedicate himself to prayers for the longevity of heaven and earth. Generation after generation, he should especially hold memorial services for Tanesada's afterlife salvation. If among the descendants any member of Chūzan acts in violation by causing disorder, harboring competitive ambitions, backsliding, or going against faith in the Lotus Sutra, such a person shall be considered unfilial and shall not be allowed to hold even one portion of Tanesada's estate. Therefore, this deed of grant is made for future reference.

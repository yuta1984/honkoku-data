Shingū and other [shrines] were destroyed by fire. It was divine fire. {etc.} The same work {Volume 12}, entry for the 9th day of the 8th month of Kenkyū 3: "Provincial shrine {Yanagida}"

○In the Kawachi-shi, Shiki District section: "The provincial shrine (sōsha) is located in Kōfu village. In ancient times, the provincial government invariably built shrines and had jurisdiction over official shrines within the province. The provincial governor, leading his subordinate officials, would first perform ceremonial rites here. The ceremony was like that of the Jingikan (Bureau of Divinities) in the capital." {Quoted from Sōsha Denkō Shōshō}

○In the Sōsha Denki Kōshō it states: "The provincial shrine of the provincial government was the provincial Bureau of Divinities, modeled after the court's Bureau of Divinities." The basis for this is found in the Shiji Saishiki, Volume 1, February Toshigoi Festival section, which states: "The deities of the Toshigoi Festival number 3,132 seats: 492 major seats {304 seats receive upper-grade official offerings, 188 seats are worshipped by provincial governors}, and 2,640 minor seats {433 seats receive lower-grade official offerings, 2,207 seats are worshipped by provincial governors}." It shows that all shrines entered in the register of shrine names participate in the Toshigoi Festival without exception. {etc.}

{In the Sanshū Meiseki-shi, Kazuno District, there is a Kuzui well with a shrine above that worships Myōjōten (Venus). What connection might this have? Both seem to have some connection with the district name}

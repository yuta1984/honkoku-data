𥦤 [𥧌 not found in dictionary] I am greatly ashamed. The enlightened rulers of old were all able to glorify their achievements - the nation was peaceful, people were happy, disasters were removed and fortune arrived. What should be cultivated and what should be pursued to achieve this way? Recently, harvests have failed year after year, and epidemics have frequently occurred. Shame and fear gather together, and I can only toil in blaming myself. Therefore, I broadly seek abundant blessings for all the people everywhere.

Thus, the previous year I sent urgent messengers to enhance and adorn all the shrines throughout the realm. Last year I universally ordered the entire realm to create golden images of the Buddha Śākyamuni, each one jō six shaku in height, and to copy one complete set of the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra each. From this spring until the autumn harvest, wind and rain have been favorable in sequence and the five grains abundant. This is indeed as if the divine response answered my humble sincere prayers. With utmost reverence and awe, there is nothing to bring peace of mind.

Examining the sūtra, it says: "If there is a land where this sūtra is lectured upon, recited, respectfully honored, and circulated, then we Four Heavenly Kings will constantly come to protect all disasters and calamities, causing them all to be eliminated, and also cause worries, sorrows, illnesses and epidemics to be removed. What is wished for will be accomplished, and the heart will constantly give rise to joy." Therefore, all provinces throughout the realm should each respectfully construct one seven-story pagoda, and copy ten sets each of the Golden Light Victorious King Sūtra and the Lotus Sūtra of the Wonderful Dharma. I also separately intend to copy the Golden Light Victorious King Sūtra in gold characters, placing one set in each pagoda. What I hope for is that the flourishing of the sacred Dharma will flow eternally with heaven and earth, and the grace of divine protection will extend to both the visible and invisible realms and be constantly fulfilled.

Those temples that construct pagodas shall also serve as the glory of the nation. Good locations must be chosen that can truly endure for a long time. If too close to people, one does not want places with offensive odors; if too far from people, one does not want to burden the masses who come to gather. Provincial governors should each strive to be solemn and adorned, while also maintaining complete purity and cleanliness, and be moved nearby by

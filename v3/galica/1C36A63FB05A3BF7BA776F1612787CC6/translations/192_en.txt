This time you have been ordered to undertake both the Odawara construction work and the Ushiku guard duty simultaneously. Regarding the construction work, we have made various apologetic appeals, but the essence of the orders is that this is a matter of great importance. From Sōun-ji Temple onward, even to places that have traditionally been exempt, everything must be included without exception. It has been declared that this temple matter should also be handled accordingly. Among the remaining laborers from this district being allocated, though it may not be painful, in this manor, no matter what kind of people they are, they must rely on this inevitably for generations to come. It is essential that they exercise proper judgment and run about without fail. Furthermore, this is being communicated orally. The above.

The Ushiku castle guard duty was at the end of the Tenshō era.

Although this is Taneyoshi's seal, it appears to have been used for generations. There are similar examples in documents of the Hitachi Edo clan.
Harumura says there appear to have been two seals - one small and one large. Both were used continuously during Tanenori's generation.

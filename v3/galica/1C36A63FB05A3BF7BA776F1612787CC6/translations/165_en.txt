Various inquiries were made within, but it was said that nothing could be found. Perhaps it had been broken, and in the end nothing came to light. {{Marginal note: And so forth. Excerpted text: "Karameki River" is probably an error for "Karamete River." Now, the back road of Konodai is called "Karamete-no-michi." This refers to the river in this area. The suggestion in Edo Meisho Zue that it is an error for "Kagami-no-se" from the Sarashina Diary is probably incorrect.}}

Ankokusan Soneiji Temple is located in Konodai Village, with temple lands of 128.5 koku {{Marginal note: Tensho 19, year of the Metal Rabbit, 11th month. The land is in both Konodai Village and Yahata Village}}

It is a Zen temple of the Soto sect, one of the three temples serving as Kanto General Registrars. The principal image is Shakyamuni Buddha, the founder was Sasaki Ujiyori {{Marginal note: Founded in Eitoku 3}}, and the founding abbot was Tsugen Jakreiōshō. This temple was originally located in Baba Village in Omi Province, but in Tensho 3 it was moved to Uwawada in Sekiyado through the arrangements of Hojo Ujimasa {{Marginal note: The present Rinsen-an temple stands on that site}}. In Genna 3 it was moved to Uchimachi, but since Uchimachi frequently suffered from floods, in Kanbun 3 it was moved again to this location.
{{Marginal note: The changes in the temple site since its founding are detailed in the bell inscription presented later}}

○This place is the ancient site of the provincial government office (kokufu), with precipitous topography and extensive grounds. There is a stone dismounting marker by the roadside, said to have been granted by Sasaki Ujiyori {{Marginal note: There is said to be a Koji-era notice board recording the name Toyama Yajiro, but since in the Koji era the temple had not yet moved to Sekiyado, this should be carefully reconsidered}}. There is a gravestone of a certain Ogasawara Saemon-no-suke {{Marginal note: He is the present lord of Katsuyama castle in Echizen}}. This was erected when he was enfeoffed at Sekiyado

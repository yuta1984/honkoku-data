This was erected at that location. ○Behind the mountain there is a stone sarcophagus, which must have belonged to a provincial governor in ancient times. It is written in a certain book that when a noble person had the stone sarcophagus excavated long ago, a tea kettle and golden bells that emerged have been made into temple treasures. ○At this site there are two large zelkova trees said to have been planted by Ota Dokan, standing opposite the dismounting stone.

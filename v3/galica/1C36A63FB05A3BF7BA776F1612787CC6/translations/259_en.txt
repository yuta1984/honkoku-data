Since the boat had been prepared in advance, they immediately untied the mooring rope and departed. The saint was not familiar with previous boat journeys, and when he mentioned that due to poor timing they had hurriedly sought passage on a convenient vessel, Jōnin saw this and said, "That must be the guest monk to whom we once lent our boat. Truly, this is an extraordinary karmic connection in this world." He invited the saint aboard the same boat again, offering him a seat nearby. As they passed a fisherman's boat, they conversed about how "those companions fish together to make their way through this floating world with their fishing lines—how pitiful it is." Jōnin then had something to ask the saint: "Honorable monk, I hear you were recently in Kamakura. If so, you must know about a priest named Nichiren who appeared there, criticized the various Buddhist schools of Kamakura in different ways, and preached the Lotus Sutra. If you do know of this, please tell us a little about the gist of his teachings. As a monk myself, I have no leisure time and do not know the details." The saint replied, "If you wish to hear about it, I shall tell you what I have heard and remember." He straightened his posture, crossed his legs in meditation position, and explained in detail how the Lotus Sutra excels among all sutras and about the doctrine that all beings in the ten realms can attain Buddhahood, citing sutras and treatises with truly eloquent speech like that of Pūrṇa.

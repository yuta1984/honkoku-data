Seeing this situation, Yoshiaki looked down and descended to the archer's side, executing a ranged attack. He struck the chain mail of the enemy's helmet neckguard and cleanly severed the head, then with the momentum of his sword swept away enemies approaching from the left. The enemies, chilled to the heart by his blade, dared not approach, so Yoshiaki rushed to a hill and waited for his allies to follow. He wiped the blood from his armor with his hat insignia and was resting when Yoshihiro and his soldiers, not knowing their general's whereabouts, fought against Ujitsuna's bannermen but were defeated by fifty horsemen and scattered toward the eastern mountain ridges. Even so, few soldiers returned to help Yoshiaki. Wondering what was happening, there appeared Yokoi Shinsuke, known throughout Odawara as the strongest archer in the eight provinces of Kanto. At that time he was the castle deputy of Miura, so from the beginning he had fought against the Boshu forces, lost many of his men, and feeling uneasy, he targeted Yoshiaki and moved in for a precise shot. In the previous battle, when the vanguard soldiers had been routed by Yoshiaki and could neither advance in fish-scale formation nor surround him in crane-wing formation, becoming discouraged, he said, "No, no, if we just try to strike down this enemy, we'll miss him. Let us carefully shoot him down," and leaping down from his horse, he concealed his hat insignia and hid himself using the rice field ridges and bushes as cover.

According to the Etsugi Volume 5 (2nd page), Jinpei 3rd year, 8th month, Taiki records that the images of the Former Sages, Former Teachers, and Nine Wise Men were painted by Kose no Kanaoka (and so on). On the 14th day of the 3rd month of Enkyū 4, on the day of Kinoe-Uma, Provisional Major Counselor Minamoto no Takatoshi took his ceremonial seat and presented a report on the dates for repairing the shrine images of the Former Sages, Former Teachers, and Nine Wise Men of the Imperial University. It was on the 3rd day of the 4th month, Mizunoe-Ne. These images were painted by Kose no Kanaoka in Gangyo 4, based on Chinese originals (and so on).
Another theory states that Minister Kibi entered Tang China and brought back paintings from the Hongwen Academy upon his return to court, placing them in the academy library of Dazaifu. The minister also commanded Baekje painters to copy those originals and placed them in the Imperial University (and so on).

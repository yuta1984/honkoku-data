Picture of Empress Jingū casting
a fishhook into the Matsura River in Hizen Province
to divine in advance the victory or defeat of the Korean expedition

Although she soaked her hair in seawater, parted and bound it
to assume male attire at Kashii Bay, the reason this appearance is
depicted here is for brevity

According to one theory, the Kumaso were actually Inuso, and though
they frequently rebelled, they refused to submit, relying on foreign aid
from Koguryeo and Silla. The Empress realized this and probably
cut off the root cause. Historical documents of that time are
ambiguous, particularly regarding Emperor Chūai's death, which
is considered questionable. However, the historical records' suggestion
that she attacked other countries to obtain treasure is greatly mistaken

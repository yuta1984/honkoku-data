The competence or incompetence [of officials] is not determined by the length of years or the purity or corruption of the era, but what wise generals and incompetent ones alike humbly hope for is that the successive appointments of provincial governors follow the Keiun era precedent, uniformly using a four-year term. Second year of Jōwa, seventh month, third day.

○According to the Ranshō-shō, regarding the term limits of provincial governors, in the sixth year hinoto-hitsuji (sixth year of Kōnin), the various provincial governors were established with four-year terms as their limit. For assistant governors of the provinces, by imperial edict of the third year kinoto-u (second year of Jōwa), seventh month, third day, governors and assistant governors of all provinces shall have a four-year limit. However, Mutsu, Dewa, Dazaifu and other [provinces] are distant, being a thousand ri away, and coming and going is troublesome and frequent, so they cannot be newly regulated.

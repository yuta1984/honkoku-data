Narita Pilgrimage Record, Volume 4

Sakura Castle is located on Mount Kashima in Inba District.《The current castle grounds being called Kashima-no-go appears to be an ancient name, as it appears in the Buddhist records of Kairinsji Temple from Eiroku 8 (1565)》. The town districts consist of six areas: Tamachi, Shinmachi, Miroku-machi, Honmachi, Honsakura-machi, and Shisui-machi. It is thirteen ri and eighteen cho from Edo.

In the seventh month of Tensho 16 (1588), leading Chiba-no-suke Kunitane, and in the eleventh month, through the arrangement of Hojo Ujimasa, a new residence was built on this site, where Kunitane's eldest daughter To was made to reside. The retainer Nakamura Uta-no-suke served as her attendant. In the seventh month of the same 18th year, after the fall of Odawara Castle, the heir Shigetane became a wanderer, and To served in the rear palace of the Tokugawa government.

In the eighth month of that year, Kuno Saburo-emon-no-jo Muneyoshi was enfeoffed 《appointed to Minbu with 13,000 koku》. Muneyoshi led, and his son Minbu-no-shoyu Munehide succeeded him. In Keicho 7 (1602), Munehide was transferred to Kuno in Totomi Province and the castle was abandoned. In the same 16th year, Doi Ohi-no-kami Toshikatsu rebuilt it. In Genna 1 (1615), the castle moat construction was completed and he moved in. From this time it became an important strategic castle of Honshu.

Hachiman Shrine is located in Osakura village. The shrine territory is twenty koku 《Tensho 19, year of the Metal Rabbit, eleventh month》. The shrine's origins are not detailed. There is a festival on August 12th. On this day there is a festival of divine procession and horse racing to Shisui. The head priest is called Taiozan Hoju.

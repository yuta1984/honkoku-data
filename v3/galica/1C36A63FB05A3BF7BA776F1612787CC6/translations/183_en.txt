About forty ri east from the Eastern Capital (Edo) into Sōshū (Shimōsa Province), there is a place called Tsugu-no-sato (Stepmother Village), named after a bridge. Tsugu became a famous place because poets from Yamabe no Akahito onward have all composed poems about it. What they sang about was Teko. Teko was the name of a girl. Why they composed poems about Teko is not yet fully understood, but according to what the villagers tell, Teko lost her mother early and her stepmother did not treat her kindly, yet Teko served her with filial piety. Tsugu-no-sato faced the sea, and all the wells contained undrinkable water, except for one well with cold spring water suitable for drinking. Teko drew water from there daily to care for her stepmother. A young man saw this and followed Teko, and several people secretly watched Teko's house. The stepmother noticed this and thought they were thieves, believing that Teko was collaborating with them. She beat Teko severely, refusing to listen to her explanations, nearly killing her. Teko then ran and threw herself from the bridge to her death. The villagers pitied her, recovered her body for burial, built up earth over the grave, and planted a pine tree as a marker. They called that bridge "Tsugu Bridge" and that well "Tsugu Well" to warn against the stepmother's evil deeds. The grave, bridge, and well are said to still exist today. Later, the monk Kūkai traveled east and stayed in this village, and the people built a temple. Since Kūkai was posthumously called Kōbō, it was named Kōbō Temple. It later fell into ruin but was restored by the monk Nichiren and still exists today. Tsugu Bridge is below it, and Tsugu Well and Teko's grave are all within a hundred steps to the northeast. After several hundred years, the sea transformed into fields, and Tsugu-no-sato is now about twenty ri south of the sea. Climbing Kōbō Temple, one sees vast plains stretching endlessly to the east, and looking west toward the Eastern Capital, one can see the castle town and smoke from houses.

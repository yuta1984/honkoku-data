It refers to water flowing into rice fields. <<This is what is meant in poems that mention "the words of pond water.">> This was called both "ike" (pond) and "numa" (marsh). <<All the famous ponds and marshes of scenic places refer to this.>>

<<Even now, in the Chūgoku region they call them ponds, while in the eastern provinces they call them marshes.>> Generally speaking, they are called ponds and marshes, but since they are water for irrigating fields, they are also called "i" (well) <<"i" refers to a place>>, "yama-i" (mountain well), or "ta-i" (field well).

It is called "iseki" because it diverts water to irrigate fields>>, dig narrow channels, and irrigate from the end of that flow. That embankment is called "ide" (irrigation channel). <<"Te" is the "te" from "nawate" (raised path), and "dote" (embankment) may also be a remnant of that word.>> Nowadays in Owari, Mino and other places they call it "igeta" (well frame). <<"Keta" would be the same as the "keta" in "yuketa" (bathing frame). This might refer to embankments built to measure and regulate the appropriate depth for people to bathe in hot springs.>> Ide in Yamashiro also became a place name because such embankments existed there. The Tamagawa River would likely be that same flow.

Asuka-i, Seka-i, and the various other "something-i" all refer to these channels and ponds, but perhaps recent scholars have understood "i" to mean only dug wells. Consider these examples: "At the dripping field-ponds where pampas grass petals scatter, wild geese cry out coldly" (Man'yōshū 9), "Wild geese cross over Fushimi's field-ponds" (Man'yōshū 9), and "Wild geese crying at field-ponds where morning mist trails" (Man'yōshū 19) - to interpret these as geese crying at the bottom of wells would be...

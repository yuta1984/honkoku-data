[It can be understood that] this Asuha deity was worshipped together with the hearth deities and others." And so forth. Now, examining the final two lines of the aforementioned poem, since it expresses the intention to pray to the Asuha deity worshipped not in one's own home but in the lodgings of destinations along the way, it can be known that this deity was worshipped in every household in any province.

One theory states: "'Niwanaka no' is a makurakotoba (pillow word) associated with the character for hemp (asa), and does not refer to worship in the garden. Asuha means 'swift-footed.' This is the same as calling Naniwa 'Naniba.' Koshiba is associated with the word 'come' (ko). The meaning of the entire poem would be 'go swiftly and return quickly.'"

According to the above theory, the deity worshipped in the imperial court was also worshipped in Echizen and other provinces as well. The reference to Kazusa appears to be based on frontier guard songs. The reference to Shimōsa in Karin Ryōzai is probably due to mistaking "upper" (jō) for "lower" (shimo). Confusion between Kazusa and Shimōsa appears frequently in various texts. Treating it like the Dragon King of Kaijin Village in Edo Meisho Zue is an inappropriate forced interpretation. {{Marginal note: Asuha Shrine exists as a subsidiary shrine of Magata Shrine in Kōzu Village. Are there others as well? We await the consideration of knowledgeable scholars.}}

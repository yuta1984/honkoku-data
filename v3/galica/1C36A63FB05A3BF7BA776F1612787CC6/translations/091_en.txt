Inba Marsh (Inbanuma) 《Marginal note: It is not a marsh but a lake. Though one might call it an inlet like Edo Bay, we follow the official designation for now》shares its name with the district, and near the marsh there is Inaba Village《Marginal note: Monoi》《Marginal note: Located upstream of the river》. The name derives from this location. The sources are numerous: one comes from between Togami and Hirato, another comes from between Kamisayama, and both converge below Funao.

The mouth of this inlet is said to be about thirty ken wide. There are many spring holes in the marsh, which local people call "Sakuchi holes." In the transition between autumn and winter, gray mullet (bora) favor the warm water and gather here, hence the name. The large ones are found in two places below Yoshitaka and seven places below Ajiki. When fishermen try standing their poles upright and casting them with all their strength, though the water is clear, the poles sink so deep that their shadows cannot be seen, then float up after a while, showing that it is indeed quite deep. The size of each is about one to two ken square. They constantly spout water without cease, though not enough to rise above the water's surface. During summer rains, there are will-o'-the-wisps above the marsh that sometimes gather

This document is in someone's possession, but since
the source from which it was copied is not recorded, its origin is unclear.
Moreover, the characters in the original and the copy may also differ.
However, since it appears after copies of documents from Kongōji Temple in Kawachi,
perhaps this is also in the possession of the same temple. Those who
examine the original should make corrections. ○From Shōwa 5th year to Genkō 1st year
is merely six years. The monk called Chien in the bell inscription
was probably the successor to this Jōchi. Both the names Jōchi and Chien
seem to have some connection. ○The Assistant Head of Left Horses is
Takatoki. The Governor of Musashi is Kanazawa Sadaaki.

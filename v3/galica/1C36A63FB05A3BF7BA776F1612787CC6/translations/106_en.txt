Preface
Our mountain (Mount Narita) possesses such remarkable spiritual efficacy and is so venerable that people of high and low station alike bow their heads in reverence, and believers from far and near make the journey here. It has now become a widely known Buddhist sanctuary. However, there were still no written records of its origins or biographies of the founding monks. The late Nakamichi Sadatoshi had long been contemplating this matter.

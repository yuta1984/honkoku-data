"Cutting rice in the edge fields, taking early seedlings" - from the Shinshūishū collection; "At the autumn hermitage of Tsukuba Well's dripping fields, smoke rises from this leaf and that leaf" - from the Shinsenzaishū collection; "In the temporary nights of Fushimi with bamboo, one must spend sleepless nights lost in melancholy" - there are still many such examples. {{The theory that the well called Kamei is Mama Well can be known to be false from this one example without waiting for further explanation}}

○Because there was a person named Kasai Saburō Kiyoshige who was a resident of Musashi Province, some people believe that Katsushika has been a subordinate district of Musashi Province since ancient times, but this is incorrect. Both the Wamyō Ruijushō and the Shūgaishō list Katsushika under Shimōsa Province. In Volume 1 of the Azuma Kagami, it states: "On the 10th day of the 11th month of Jishō 4 (1180), Maruko-shō in Musashi Province was granted to Kasai Saburō Kiyoshige. Tonight, [the lord] stayed at his residence." Therefore, the Jōsuiki records Kiyoshige as a resident of Musashi Province. Although his native province was Nishi-Katsushika in Shimōsa, he is called a resident of Musashi Province because he resided in Maruko-shō in Musashi. {{etc.}}

[The text states that] traveling by river boat on the Sumida River through Kasai no shō (manor), pushing through reeds for about half a day, [Sōchō] stopped at Jōkōji, a Jōdo sect temple, from the port called Imai. This should be taken as evidence (this passage misread "shō" (manor) as "fu" (provincial capital)).

○The Katsushika-ura Meishō-shi states that Kasai was called the provincial capital of Shimōsa Province. However, when examining the Azuma Kagami, Lord Yoritomo established his military camp at the Shimōsa provincial capital from the 19th day of the 9th month to the 2nd day of the 10th month, and then crossed both the Futoi (Tone River) and Sumida rivers, so the provincial capital should be located east of the Tone River.

Also, the same work records: "Jishō 4, 9th month, 17th day: Without waiting for Hirotune's arrival, [Yoritomo] proceeded toward Shimōsa Province. Chiba no suke Tsunetane, accompanied by his six sons, assembled at the Shimōsa provincial capital" (etc.) "28th day: A messenger was dispatched and Edo Tarō Shigenaga was summoned" "29th day: Although an official letter was sent yesterday, as he did not come, Naka Shirō Koreshige was dispatched to Kasai Saburō Kiyoshige's place" "2nd day of 10th month: Crossed both the Futoi (Tone River) and Sumida rivers with elite troops numbering over 30,000 horsemen" (etc.) (This passage from the Azuma Kagami is abbreviated text, recorded as cited in the Meishō-shi).

○According to the Wamyō Ruijushō (Volume 5, Provinces and Counties section), Shimōsa Province (the provincial capital was located in Katsushika County, with a travel distance of 30 days upstream and 15 days downstream) governed eleven counties (with fields totaling 26,432 chō, 6 tan, and 234 bu).

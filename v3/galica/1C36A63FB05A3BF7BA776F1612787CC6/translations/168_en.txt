The monks grieved over this even in ordinary times and suffered from it even in times of turmoil. The assembly discussed and said, "Why do we not take warning from the overturned cart of the advance guard? If we do not change location, will we not end up like fish [out of water]?" In my opinion, the heart that considers oneself is favored not only by our Buddha, but Confucius also liked this. I request that we move to another location so that future residents will have no cause for worry. They then consulted with Kokufu-dai in Honshu Province and petitioned Shogun Minamoto no Ason Ietsuna. In the third year of Kanbun, the year of Mizunoto-u, in the latter third of mid-autumn (1663), imperial favor descended from above, granting land of two ri square to become this territory. Mount Shiho dances between the eaves, and the Eastern Sea is visible below the steps. This is what Du Fu meant when he wrote, "The window contains the thousand-autumn snow of the western peaks, the gate moors ten-thousand-li ships from Eastern Wu." This is truly a scenic wonder of the region.

Also within the precincts is Dharma King Slope. According to tradition, a dharma king was buried in this place in ancient times, and the stone coffin still exists to this day. Ah, from what era was this? Although there are no written records, what is transmitted through oral tradition—how could that be empty? Our temple has traditionally transmitted the secret teachings of the Dharma King Samadhi. Perhaps this is something whose divine opportunity matured later? The assembly rejoiced and moved their seat. Previously, wherever former Buddhas had dwelt, dharma implements were installed, with the bell taking precedence. Retaining the stone bell, the golden bell of Gion is truly sufficient as a model.

Therefore, I wished to construct a building and planned to cast a temple bell in advance. However, with individual strength alone it was difficult to accomplish, so I appealed broadly to both clergy and laity to achieve this.

Chōchō refers to Wakaoribe no Morohito. Chōchō means shuchōchō (chief clerk). Upon examination, this poem appears to have been composed by the parents or wife of a frontier guard. Perhaps a character is missing after "morohito." The above is the explanation from the abbreviated commentary.

Upon examination, in the Shiki Jinmyōchō (Register of Deities) there is Asuha Shrine in Asuha District, Echizen Province. In the Kojiki-den it states: "The meaning of the name Asuha deity has not yet been determined, but if I venture to force an explanation, it might mean 'foothold' (ashiba). The word 'foot' (ashi) being called 'asu' can be seen in place names like Asuha cited here. Generally, wherever it may be, the ground where people set their feet is called ashiba (foothold), and even in today's language we speak of good or bad ashiba. This is that. Now, generally what is called 'ba' (place) is an abbreviation of 'niwa' (garden/courtyard), and there are many cases where ōba (great garden) is called ohoba. Also, the character for 'ba' is sometimes read as 'niwa.' Whatever the case, a place where things are done is called 'nanika-ba.' When we say 'nani-ba,' it becomes voiced due to euphonic change, but since it is originally an abbreviation of 'niwa,' it should be pronounced with the clear sound 'ha.' Therefore, the 'ha' in this deity's name should be pronounced with a clear tone. Now, this deity protects the ground where people set their feet, whether they are conducting affairs or engaging in any kind of enterprise, which is why it may have been worshipped in every household."

The statement in Shūchūshō that there is a deity called Asuha in Kazusa Province is incorrect. The theory that takes "niwanaka" as a place name of that province is also poor. Based on the fact that this poem reads "niwanaka no" (in the garden), it refers to the gardens of common people's houses at that time.

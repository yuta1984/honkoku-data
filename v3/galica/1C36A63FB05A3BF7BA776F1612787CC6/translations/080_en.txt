Jōkai-san Shōin-ji Temple　Located in Ōsakura Village. Temple holdings of 20 koku {{Marginal note: Tenshō 19th year, metal rabbit, 11th month}} Zen sect, Sōtō school, subsidiary temple of Shōhō-in of Tsuchimuro. Principal deity is Shakyamuni Buddha. Founded in Kyōroku 1st year by Chiba no suke Katsutane {{Marginal note: died Tenbun 21st year, 5th month, 21st day}}. Founding priest was Kaō Sohō Oshō {{Marginal note: passed away Tenbun 20th year, 11th month, 8th day}}. Within the temple grounds are several grave markers of successive generations of the Chiba family. They are presumably from Katsutane onward. Since there are no carved inscriptions, the details cannot be known. Within the garden is a small pond called Chiba-sui (Chiba Water). There is an ancient pine tree that covers it. {{Marginal note: At that time, temple holdings of 75 kan-mon were granted, as recorded in fragmentary old ledgers according to the Sakura Fudoki}}

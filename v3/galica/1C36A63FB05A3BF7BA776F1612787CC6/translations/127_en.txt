...doing so," etc. This patron (danna) likely refers to Empress Kōmyō. The mound (tsuka) may have become flat ground due to the vicissitudes of time (sōsō no hen), or perhaps "mound" was merely a name and it was originally flat ground. "Inscription" (mei) refers to something with rhyme, but this should properly be called "record" (shi) or "inscription" (shiki). However, it appears that since ancient times, anything carved on metal or stone has been commonly understood as "inscription" (mei), so it is recorded this way. "King of Sutras" (kyōō) refers to the Lotus Sutra (one section, eight volumes, twenty-eight chapters). In its twenty-third chapter, the "Original Affairs of Medicine King Bodhisattva," there is the phrase "this sutra is the king among all sutras," which is likely the source of this term.

The provincial nunnery (kokubun-niji) of Shimōsa Province is mentioned in the Ruijū Sandai-kyaku, where an imperial edict of the fourteenth day of the second month of Tenpyō 13 (same as the third month entry of Tenpyō 13 in the Shoku Nihongi) states: "In each province, grant fifty households and ten chō of paddy fields to the monks' temple, and ten chō of paddy fields to the nuns' temple. The monks' temple must have twenty monks, and its name shall be Konkōmyō Shitennō Gokoku-no-tera (Golden Light Four Heavenly Kings State-Protecting Temple). The nuns' temple shall have ten nuns, and that temple shall be Hokke Metsuzai-no-tera (Lotus Sin-Extinguishing Temple). Both temples should be located near each other and should receive religious precepts together," etc. (The Kōchō Kinseki-hen cites a bronze tablet edict of Emperor Shōmu Katsuho Kanshin and shows copying ten copies of the Lotus Sutra) The Shoku Nihongi records an edict of the day of kinoe-saru in the sixth month of Tenpyō 16, stating: "In the provinces of the capital region and the seven circuits, each province shall allocate 40,000 bundles from regular taxes, contributing 20,000 bundles each to both the monks' and nuns' temples. Each year they shall lend this out at interest, and use that profit to eternally support temple construction." However, the Engi-shiki lists the provincial temple allowance as 50,000 bundles, which appears to represent an additional layer of expense beyond what was established in the Tenpyō period. The Yakuō-hon-in (Medicine King Chapter Cloister) was previously mentioned...

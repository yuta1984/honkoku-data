Joran Poetry Collection
The castle ruins lie desolate, an ancient Zen temple
Imperial ambitions have vanished, the stormy atmosphere grows thick
I see only moss patterns burying the stone sarcophagi
Once heard pine trees hanging bronze bells
The rhombus-flowered mirror darkens the dragon pond's color
Sedge grass mats retain traces of the crane's palanquin
The river waters remain melancholy to this day
Flowing eastward day and night, sobbing with a murmuring sound
　The above: Nostalgia for Kōnodai

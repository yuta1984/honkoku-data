At age forty-six, he again went to Shimōsa Province. His mother, of the Kiyohara clan, died. The son of the Toki family took the tonsure and became his disciple. He was given the name Nitchō. At age forty-seven, hearing that there were letters from the Mongols, he entrusted a letter to the Kamakura warrior Yadoya Mitsunori, discussing the coming foreign invasion. He also submitted a petition to the regent Tokimune, requesting to debate the right and wrong of Buddhist questions with monks of various sects in the government office. At age forty-eight, he went to Kai Province and returned to Sagami Province. At age fifty, due to complaints from Gokurakuji's Ryōkan and others, the master was summoned by the government for interrogation. They charged him with using Buddhism as a pretext to disturb the state, making him liable for execution. On the thirteenth day of the ninth month of this year, Tokimune ordered his retainer Yoritsuna to arrest the master and parade him through the streets. They also imprisoned six people including Nichirō and immediately tried to execute the master at Tatsunokuchi that night. Just before the execution, he was pardoned and exiled to Sado. At age fifty-one, he was in Ōno in Sado Province. In the fourth month, he was moved to reside in Ichinoya in Ishida village. At age fifty-three, in the third month of this year, his crimes were pardoned and on the twenty-sixth day he returned to Kamakura. He finally retired to Mount Minobu in Kai Province. He wrote the "Hokke Shuyō" (Essential Points of the Lotus Sutra). Monks and laypeople from all directions came to revere and follow him in ever-increasing numbers, and his propagation flourished daily. At age fifty-eight, he ordered his disciple Nikkō to go to Suruga Province to spread the teaching. Many changed their sect. Ken'yo of Jissōji Temple and others, out of jealousy, slandered him to the authorities. The officials arrested twenty-four of his followers and sent them to Kamakura.

May all the heavenly deities provide protection and supervision, proclaiming this throughout far and near, making my intentions known. There are also various wishes and regulations as follows:

1. In each province, both monks' temples and nuns' temples shall each be granted ten chō of rice fields.

1. In each province, construct a monks' temple that must have twenty monks. Name this temple "Golden Light Four Heavenly Kings Temple for Protecting the Nation."
   The nuns' temple shall have ten nuns, and name this temple "Lotus Temple for Eliminating Sins." The two temples should be appropriately separated and receive proper instruction. If there are any vacancies, they must immediately be filled. These monks and nuns must recite the Victorious King Sutra on the eighth day of every month. At mid-month, 
   they should recite the precepts and perform karman ceremonies.

1. In provinces that establish the aforementioned temples, on the six monthly fasting days, both public and private persons must not engage in fishing, hunting, or killing living beings. Provincial governors should constantly
   provide supervision and inspection.

1. May the heavenly and earthly deities harmoniously accord with each other, constantly bringing good fortune and eternally protecting the nation.

1. May the venerable spirits of all former emperors since the opening of heaven and earth long enjoy the jeweled grove and together visit the precious temples.

1. May the Retired Emperor, the Great Lady Fujiwara, Empress Fujiwara, the Empress Dowager, princes and below,
   and the Senior Second Rank Right Minister Tachibana no Sukune Moroe and others equally benefit from these merits and together proceed to the other shore.

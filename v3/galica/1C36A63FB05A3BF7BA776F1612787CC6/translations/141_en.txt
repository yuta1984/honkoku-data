From the Senzai-shū, Miscellaneous Section, Lower, Rotōka (six-line poems)
　　Having served as Governor of Shimōsa Province but
　　having returned to the capital after completing his term,
　　a poem sent to Minamoto no Toshiyori Asomi　　　　Minamoto no Nakamasa
　Though I have come through the layered mists
　of the eastern provinces, without meeting you,
　I still feel as though we are separated
　　　　　　　　Reply　　Minamoto no Toshiyori Asomi
　　　　　　　　The moon bridge where writing ceased,
　　　　　　　　reading that letter, the mist
　　　　　　　　that had separated us clears
　　　　　　　　and I can welcome you

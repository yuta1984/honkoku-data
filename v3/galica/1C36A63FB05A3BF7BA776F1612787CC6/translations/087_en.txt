Fukutoku 2 corresponds to Entoku 3. Tōhaku was of the Hitachi Oda clan, who established residence in Shimōsa, and there is a gyakushū memorial stone from Bunmei 18 in Daikon village, Katori district. Details about Tōhaku are found in the Jōsen Zatsuwa.
Alternatively, it is said that in the death register of Uren Jōfukuji temple, it states: "Kyōroku 1, year of earth-rat, first day of third month, Ōta Gokurakuji founding priest Kokai died. Kokai was called Tōhaku Shōnin." In the Wakōin chronological records, it is reliably stated that he restored Muramatsu. Whether he was of the Oda clan is uncertain. The Jōsen Zatsuwa is similar to the Tōgoku Senki chronicles and cannot be relied upon as evidence.

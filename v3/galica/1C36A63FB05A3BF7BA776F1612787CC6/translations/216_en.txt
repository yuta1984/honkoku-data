Narita Pilgrimage Record, Volume 2

Hachiman Shrine (located in Hachiman Village)
To the north there is a village called Ko-Hachiman, which is probably the original location. The shrine's territory is 52 koku (granted in the 19th year of Tensho, November of the year of Metal Rabbit). The shrine's tradition is as follows:

By imperial decree of Emperor Uda, Iwashimizu Hachiman Shrine was transferred and enshrined here during the Kanpyo era (according to some sources, when Emperor Seiwa established Hachiman Shrine at Iwashimizu in Yamashiro Province from Usa Shrine during the Jogan era, general Hachiman shrines were established in each of the sixty-odd provinces. The Edo Meisho Zue states that this shrine, like Kokubunji temples, was the principal Hachiman shrine of the province and was probably originally located in the provincial capital. The Kaikoku Zakki Hyochu suggests that Hachiman shrines were established in sixty-odd provinces when Minamoto no Yoritomo appointed provincial governors as general pursuit commissioners, since Hachiman was the deity revered by the Minamoto clan. The Suruga Fudoki records that in the 3rd year of Jingo-keiun, 9th month, the Dazaifu shrine priest Asomaro received an imperial decree to establish shrines to the ancestor lord Honta in the five home provinces and seven circuits. Another theory states that in the 1st year of Tencho, 9th month, Wake no Asomi Matsuna was ordered by imperial decree to establish worship in all provinces. Of these various theories, it is unclear which is correct, but each probably has its basis, so I present them all for reference).

During the Kenkyu era, the Genji Right Shogun added repairs and construction (the shrine's tradition considers this the orthodox account, based on a bell inscription from the Genko era).

January 15th: Tsutsugayu ritual (it is said there are always omens when divining the year's harvest in advance)
August 15th: Hojoe ritual takes place. On this day the portable shrine is brought out (there is a performance called tsukumai).

A long pole is wrapped with white cloth, the cloth is tied together to serve as footholds, and people with prayers climb the pole to worship toward the shrine, then worship the four directions before descending. This practice exists in various places and is probably similar to the swings of Tang China (according to the Katsushika Meisho-shi, tsukumai is a dance transmitted from Tsukuba, abbreviated from Tsukuba to tsukumai. The Hachiman festival is the second greatest festival in Honshu after the Katori Shrine festival of April 5th. For five days from the 14th to 18th, men and women crowd together in great numbers. This town sells much ginger and is therefore also called Ginger Town).

There is a sacred ginkgo tree (called a "joining tree," about three jo in circumference, with many white snakes living in its hollow).
The head priest temple is called Hozenji (a Tendai sect temple under Kan'eiji. The honji is Amida Nyorai).
The shrine priest is called Suzuki Shume (receives an allocation of five koku).
Beside the main shrine is a dismounting sign. The origin is detailed...

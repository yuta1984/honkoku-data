Tekona
throwing herself
into the inlet
of Mama

From Keien Ichishi Shūi (Nokanso/Wild Cold Grass):
In Katsushika
the patrinia flowers
of ancient times remain unchanged—
even their shadows
have withered
on this desolate field

Man'yōshū Volume 9
In the eastern land where roosters crow, from ancient times to now without cease has been told the tale of Tekona of Mama in Katsushika, who wore hemp clothing with blue collar attached, dressed in straight-woven skirts, without even combing her hair or wearing shoes when she went out—could even a sacred maiden wrapped in brocade and silk compare to this beloved? With her full moon face, smiling like a flower as she stood, men would gather and hide like summer insects drawn to flame, like boats rowing into a harbor. When people spoke of her, [saying she] could not live much longer, why did she throw herself away? In the deep waters of the roaring harbor where waves sound, my beloved lies sleeping. This happened in distant ages, yet I feel as if I saw frost yesterday.
- Takahashi no Muraji Mushimaro

Unable to grab
raincoat and hat
in the sudden
evening shower,
thoroughly soaked
at Mama's Tsugi Bridge

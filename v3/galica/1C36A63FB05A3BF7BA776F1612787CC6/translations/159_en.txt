As many men and horses were being cut down, a man called Ōta Shimotsuke-no-kami, who was leading the vanguard of the Odawara forces, saw Genroku in this state and perhaps thought "Is this my son-in-law Genroku?" He rode up and called out: "How now, Genroku! You have committed rebellion without just cause. If you were my ally, you should somehow repent your past wrongs and surrender. I would spare your life at least. Moreover, your conduct today is truly admirable. However, for what crime do you strike the horses? It is men who should be struck, not horses. To strike down so many horses is surely a sin."

To this, [Genroku replied]: "How dare you say such things! I shall strike only men then. Try to receive this!" He then attacked Shimotsuke from a distance. Shimotsuke also tried to strike back with his sword, but being struck by such great force, how could he withstand it? He tumbled and fell into the deep rice field in front of him. Starting with this, Masaki Taizen and others cut in and thrust forward.

Meanwhile, beginning with Tominaga Saburō-zaemon, Yamagaku Shirō-zaemon-no-jō, Nakatō Dewa-no-kami, and Kawamura Shuri-no-suke, 140 horsemen of Odawara's vanguard were killed in battle, and just as they were falling into disadvantage, Hōjō Kazusa-no-suke came cutting in from the flank, waving the banner of Chiō Hachiman. Lord Satomi's vanguard, being attacked by fresh troops, withdrew, and the second formation moved in to replace them and cut their way out. At this point, Ujimasa observed and [called out]: "Do not let Kazusa-no-suke be killed! Continue the attack!"

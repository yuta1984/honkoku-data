○Calling Great Priest Supervisor Gyōki a "bosatsu" (bodhisattva) was a private matter, not by imperial permission. In the Shoku Nihongi, Emperor Shōmu volume《Marginal note: Tenpyō-shōhō 1st year, 2nd month, hinoto-tori day, regarding Gyōki's Buddhist transformation》it states: "Emperor Toyosakura-hiko (Emperor Shōmu) greatly revered him, issued an edict granting him the rank of Great Priest Supervisor, and simultaneously allowed 400 people to become monks. The priest's miraculous spiritual powers were numerous in all categories, and at that time he was also called Gyōki Bosatsu《Marginal note: and so forth》."

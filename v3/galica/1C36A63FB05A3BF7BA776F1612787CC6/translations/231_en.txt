{{called Kyōji}} located in Nakayama Village. The temple territory is fifty koku and one to余 {{Tenshō 19, year of the Metal Rabbit, 11th month}}. This is the place where Nichiren Shōnin first turned the Wheel of Dharma. The founder, Toki Harima-no-kami, was originally born in Toki, Inaba Province. {{Toki is a village name in Kono District, Inaba Province. In the Wamyō Ruijushō it is written as Batō. Some say that "ba" is "toki" and is an error in cursive script}}. After moving to this place, he served in Kamakura, but in the old days of Kōan, he took refuge in Nichiren Shōnin, became a monk, and took the name Nichijō. {{Died on the 20th day of the 3rd month of Shōan 1, year of the Earth Boar, at age 80. His grave marker is at the Inner Temple grounds}}. He immediately donated the land of his residence. {{A certain book says that Ōta Gorōzaemon Jōmyō received the teachings of Nichijō and converted his own residential land into a Buddhist temple, calling it Shōchūzan Honmyōji. Jōmyō was the son of Nakayama Minbu-no-shōyū Yasuyuki}}

{{The land of the present main hall is this Jōmyō's residential land and is the site of Honmyōji. ○ The original site of the Hokke Hall is about three chō to the east, and the form of the earthwork still remains. It is Toki's residential land. Now it is called the Inner Temple. The Hokke Hall that was at this place is commonly called Shikan Hall. Now it has been moved to behind the main hall}}. It became a great hall for the widespread propagation of the Dharma lineage. The second patriarch was Nichikō Shōnin {{died on the 26th day of the 4th month of Shōwa 3, at age 56}}, and the third patriarch was called Nichiyū Shōnin {{called Tairin Ajari. Died on the 19th day of the 5th month of Ōan 7, at age 78. About two chō southwest of the present main hall is a place called Yūshi-yama, which is his tomb. At this place there is also a monument to the second patriarch Nichikō Shōnin}}. Later, during the time of the twelfth patriarch Nichikō Shōnin, the present vermillion seal document was granted {{Nichikō died on the 27th day of the 8th month of Keichō 3, year of the Earth Dog}}.

○In the Kamakura Ōsōshi {{Volume 2, 28th page}}, Chiba-no-suke Munetane died in battle at Miidera, and Sadatane, until he fled to the northern provinces, was on the Imperial side as a companion to Nitta Yoshisada, but unwillingly became an ally of Takauji. However, his younger brother Tanesada remained on the Imperial side in Chiba. Munetane's son, Nichiyū Shōnin, was a scholar of the Hokke sect at Hokekyōji in Nakayama, Shimōsa Province.

They were thrown into underground dungeons. The master sent letters to console and instruct them. In this year, his disciple Nichihō requested to carve a statue of the master to leave for posterity. When the statue was completed, the master himself performed the eye-opening ceremony. At age sixty, he built a new hall on Mount Minobu and named it Kuonji Temple of Mount Minobu. At age sixty-one, in the fourth month, he drew with his own hand a picture of the Treasure Tower Assembly. The master was naturally skilled in calligraphy and painting, and was said to be particularly masterful in calligraphy. This autumn he suffered from a cold. In the ninth month, he told his disciples: "I have something in mind and will go to Ikegami in Musashi Province." He then departed from Mount Minobu and arrived at Munenaka's place in Ikegami on the eighteenth day. On the twenty-fifth day, after finishing his lecture on the Risshō Ankokuron, he told the assembly: "Within three times seven days (twenty-one days), I shall pass away." On the eighth day of the tenth month, he designated six senior disciples (Nichitai, Nichirō, Nikkō, Nichikō, Nitchō, and Nichiji) and left his final instructions to the assembly, commanding them to regard these six disciples as they would regard him. On the thirteenth day, together with the assembly, he chanted the "Expedient Means" chapter, and upon reaching the phrase "nyūbutsu chikenddō ko" (entering the Buddha's knowledge and insight), he finally passed away. He lived sixty-one years, with forty-six years in the Buddhist law. Following funeral rites, he was cremated in the mountains. On the sixteenth day, his remains were collected and sent to Mount Minobu according to his final instructions. In the first month of the following year, a separate hall was built and his remains were enshrined there. Seventy years later, during the Ryakuō era, an imperial edict granted him the title of Great Bodhisattva. 《The above excerpts the essential points》

When we inquire about this, in "Man'yō-kō" Volume 6, it states that Akahito's poem about Tekona was composed around the beginning of imperial rule in the Nara period, but since the poem says "in ancient times," this maiden must have lived during the time of Asuka Okamoto Palace, and it determines this to be the reign of Emperor Jomei. 《The evidence is that the poem from Volume 14, "Is it true that people say the Tekona of Mama in Katsushika resembles me?" is determined to be from Tekona's lifetime during the Okamoto period. Okamoto Palace refers to Emperor Jomei. From his first year to the first year of Tenpyō is 101 years.》

Also, in "Man'yō Ryakuge," citing Motoori Norinaga's theory, this poem is not about events during Tekona's lifetime, but rather the song of a woman rejoicing, asking "Is it true that people say I resemble the Tekona of old?" If this theory is correct, it fits well with the ancient records that say Tekona drowned herself in the inlet during Emperor Inkyō's reign. 《The style of this poem is indeed characteristic of the Asuka Okamoto Palace period, so it is determined to be a poem from Emperor Jomei's time. Counting back from his first year to Emperor Inkyō's first year is 218 years. The phrase "Tekona of old" becomes quite understandable.》

Furthermore, regarding whether this mountain was already temple grounds or residential land when Tekona drowned herself in ancient times—to inquire about events from a thousand years ago from a thousand years hence is truly difficult to know. However, the transformation of mulberry fields into blue seas happens in an instant according to the way of the world, and when landowners change repeatedly, graves become desolate and easily turn into fields. How could [anything remain unchanged for] a thousand years...

Respectfully
　We humbly cast this bronze bell
Great Japan, Eastern Province, Shimōsa's First Guardian Shrine
Katsushika Hachiman, this Great Bodhisattva, as transmitted,
During Kanpyō era, by imperial edict of Emperor Uda this shrine was established
Since Kenkyū era, the Right General has shown exceptional reverence
Heaven is eternal, earth endures forever
Before lies the vast horizontal sea, the path connects to distant villages, fish and insects move by nature
The dawn voice of the floating bell awakens people and beasts from sleep, the golden night sound opens

May it eternally remove worldly desires and证 enlightenment

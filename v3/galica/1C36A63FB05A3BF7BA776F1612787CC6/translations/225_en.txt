They absolutely forbid entry by surrounding it with fences, saying there will surely be divine retribution. <<According to one theory, the area around this forest belongs to Hata territory, with only the forest being Gyōtoku territory.>>

<<Therefore it is called "Hachiman shirazu" (Hachiman the Unknown), but if that were all, would they go so far as to fence it off to keep people out? It must surely be the site of an official shrine, or perhaps the burial ground of a provincial governor or the like. Considering the local legend that says the spirits of Taira no Masakado's remaining followers once appeared as clay figurines, this must be a burial ground, and the clay figures would be funerary objects.>>

Hachiman Station is at the head of the road to Bōsō, and the three post stations of Senju, Nii-shuku, and Hachiman are under the jurisdiction of the highway magistrate, so it must have been a post station in ancient times as well. If we consider present-day Ko-Hachiman to be the ancient station, then the Inoue mentioned in the Engi-shiki must also be this place. This is because Funabashi was called Ōhi <<which could also be written as Ōi or Ōseki>>, and Ōhi represents Ōseki (great weir), where in ancient times they dammed Mama Bay to create irrigation water. Therefore it was probably also called Inoue. <<Upon reflection, since the medieval period, the characters for "hi" (sun/day) and "i" (well) have been confused. Examples like calling Ōhi River "Ōi River" are too numerous to count.>>

In the Shinyū Zuihitsu it states: "The term 'i' refers to water used for irrigating fields." <<Nowadays in provinces like Owari and Mino, from one water intake, water is supplied to about seven or eight villages each. Those villages are called "i-gumi" (well groups), and the rice used to cover miscellaneous expenses related to this is called "i-ryōmai" (well fee rice). Dividing this according to assessed rice yield is called "i-daka" (well assessment).>> Thus, mountain fields are constructed by building dikes between mountain ridges to collect mountain runoff and rainwater into ponds, <<as can be understood from the phrase "Tsukuba peak's suso-meguri no ta-i" in Man'yōshū volume 9>>, channeling water through sluice gates to the areas below.

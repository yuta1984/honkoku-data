○Asuha Shrine: In the Man'yōshū 《Volume 20, folio 24》, in a frontier guard song from Kazusa Province: "To Asuha deity in the courtyard, inserting small brushwood, I shall speak until I return." In the Kojiki, among the children of Ōtoshi deity are Niwatsuchi deity, and next Asuha deity 《etc.》, who is the hearth deity. In the Toshigoi Festival prayer, the ritual words of the Zama shrine maidens 《having been completed and offered》 before the imperial deities 《state》: "The names Ikui, Sakui, Tsunagai, Asuha, Hahiki 《are》 respectfully announced" and so forth. This refers to temporarily constructing a sacred space (himorogi) with small brushwood in the courtyard for the first time. This is called "koshiba-sashi." "Are wa" means "I am." In the Genryaku text it is written as "mud." The above is one poem.

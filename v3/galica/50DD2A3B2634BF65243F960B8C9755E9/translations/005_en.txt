2. People of the Great Qing

The Great Qing is the current dynastic name of China. Because the emperor's homeland is Tartary, they reformed the customs of the Great Ming period. For this reason, the illustrations of the two countries are separated to show the customs of past and present. The two capitals and thirteen circuits, writing system, classics and histories, and scholarly methods follow the previous dynasty without change.

Sumatra People
Sumatra is also called Samatra. It is an island country north of Java country [see section "6. Javanese People"]. This is also an extremely hot country, where the people and customs are base, there is no sovereign ruler, and each person rules their own territory. There are no conflicts. Although this country is said to produce gold and silver, most of the people do not engage in mining. When they occasionally obtain gold nuggets, they trade them with travelers. Both northern and southern stars can be seen. To the east of this country is Brunei, where the people and customs are similar, and it is constantly hot. Therefore, it is not recorded separately. Java, Sumatra, Brunei, etc. are close to Magellanica (Strait of Magellan).

Tartar People

Tartar's original name is Tachitan (韃而靼), but now the character "而" is omitted. In that country there are two types: eastern and western, black and white. The tribal groups are extremely numerous, and it is a large country divided into forty-eight territorial divisions. What was called the ancient Hu country, or sometimes called Mongol, are all alternative names for this country. The southern sea borders Chinese territory, while the north is close to the ice sea in extremely cold lands, where the length of days and nights in the four seasons differs greatly from other regions in many places. It is said to be the most prosperous and fertile country. The people of this country favor archery and horsemanship, with customs of bravery and strength. It extends from forty-three to sixty-four degrees north latitude. It is short from north to south and long from east to west.

5. Tonkin People

Tonkin is a country that has belonged to Chinese territory since ancient times, using Chinese characters, though the language is different. What was called Kōchi (Cochinchina) by the Chinese in ancient times refers to this country. In recent times it was divided into two countries: the eastern region is called Tonkin and the southern region is called Guangnan. Now only Guangnan is called Cochinchina. Since their customs are similar, Cochinchina is not illustrated separately. Both are warm countries. They are located approximately fifty-six degrees north of the equator.

1. People of the Great Ming
The Great Ming refers to China. Since they change their dynastic names through the generations, there is no fixed designation. The people themselves call their country "Chūka" (Middle Flowery) or "Chūgoku" (Middle Kingdom). It was the Great Ancestor Emperor of the Great Ming who established fifteen provinces and set up one capital and thirteen circuits. The reason Japan calls China "Tōdo" (Tang Land) is because during the Great Tang period, friendly relations with Japan flourished. The reason it is also called "Kara" is that ancient Japan referred to foreign countries as "Kara," which is why the characters for Han, Tang, and Korea are all read as "kara." "Shina" is a name used from the direction of Tianzhu (India) and is a Sanskrit word. "Shintan" is also said to be a phonetic transformation of "Shina."

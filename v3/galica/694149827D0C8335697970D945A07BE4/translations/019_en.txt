Following the oracle, the deity was enshrined at this location, and the place name was also called Masumiyoshi, the land of Masumiyoshi. However, according to the explanation of the shrine families, the Sumiyoshi deities enshrined in Chikuzen and Nagato provinces each have three seats, while the current Sumiyoshi in Settsu Province has four seats: the first is the Great Deity, the second is Usa Myōjin (who is Takiri-hime-no-Mikoto), the third comprises Sokotsutsuo, Nakatsutso, and Uwatsutsuo (these are counted as three seats), and the fourth is Empress Jingū. This differs greatly from the explanation in the sacred texts. Based on Urabe Kanenaoka's poem "From the salt paths of Ahagihara by the western sea, the Sumiyoshi deities appeared," one should follow the explanation of the sacred texts.

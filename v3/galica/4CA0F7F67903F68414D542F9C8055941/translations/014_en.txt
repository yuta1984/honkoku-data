Such is the way I obtain [divine support]. Therefore, even though I dwell in this world performing such deeds, there is no suffering whatsoever. For those without karmic connections, I create connections; for those with connections, I teach the Buddha's dharma. What sorrows or sufferings could there possibly be?"

When he answered thus, the monk nodded and laughed heartily, saying, "I too am the same. From now on, I shall manifest my form in India and guide sentient beings. Long ago, when Shakyamuni Buddha appeared on Vulture Peak and gave his teachings, you and I were together listening to those sermons. Since we parted at that time, it has been over fifteen hundred years that we have not met!" He said, "We shall surely meet again before long," and the monk and Hotei took each other's hands.

They conversed together, sometimes sharing laughter. Whatever they spoke of, since their words were in the Indian language, the people nearby could not understand their conversation.

Thus they bid farewell and parted. The monk mounted the clouds and ascended toward the void. Hotei watched him go for a while, and that day he remained there.

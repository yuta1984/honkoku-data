persistently tried to stop him, but he paid no heed and went
deep into the mountains, so now surely
he must have been eaten by tigers
and perished. How pitiful!"
Just as they were saying this, a person appeared carrying a bag on his back. The people were surprised
and puzzled, and when they inquired further about the circumstances,
he told them about these events. The mountain people thought this admirable
and invited him into their homes.
When they listened to his sermons,
the noble teachings were beyond words.
Each person shed tears of joy, when
suddenly the entire village shook,
and many children who had been playing
cried out at the top of their voices
and fled in confusion. Even those who until now had been
sitting peacefully without other thoughts, listening to the sermon,
were startled by the children's cries
and came out to see fearsome
tigers—five or six of them—approaching.
What could this mean? These people,
the young children, the elderly
parents and servant girls wanted to flee but
had nowhere to run. They stopped, having
no way to defend themselves. "What shall we do?"
they said in great confusion. Then Hotei stood
up and said, "Why have you come
to take people? For what reason
have you come here?" At this,
the tigers each carried plants in their mouths,
pressing close together, and piled them
in front of Hotei. Rare flower branches,
fine plants, aloe wood branches,
crystal jewels,
and various other things
they carried in their mouths and piled up, beautifully
decorating the entire area. When Hotei saw this, he said, "So
you have respectfully remembered and
heeded the dharma teaching I showed you before. Now I shall
further teach you about
seeing your true nature and attaining enlightenment." Then he preached and instructed them roughly,
and from both eyes of the tigers—five, six, seven of them gathered there—
tears flowed uniformly

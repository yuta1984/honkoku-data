Mountain Pheasant (Yamadori)
A bird that resembles a pheasant
It is a bird with a long and beautiful tail
The drooping tail of the mountain pheasant
is also sung about in poetry

Wild Goose (Gan)  
The feather color is light
black and the belly is white
In autumn it migrates
to the south, and in spring
it goes to the
north

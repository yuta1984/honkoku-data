Not knowing it was a god who tied sacred ropes elsewhere, how sad the things I prayed for

Ten
Shall I tell them to say they came tonight as a test? As if someone might come out of spite
Same　　　　　Shōkyokutei
On nights we meet, even greater sorrow - with only lament, there's no way to return to the past when we didn't meet

My sleeves are more drenched than pampas grass - won't the shoots of my hidden feelings emerge?
Hikimata　　　　Teruo
Look how the cold person, when white dew settles on autumn leaves, they turn red
Shibata　　　　Baikoku
The sorrowful world sung of has withered - in love's mountain depths where no bird calls are heard
Tsu　　　　　Isozeya
Following the example of the ninth month's moon, the nights waiting for someone who doesn't come must have obstacles like pine trees

Having made promises but not visiting on nights, lying in bed with arm as pillow, only lament has grown more intense
　　　　　　Kanga
How thickly it grows! Thinking only of the grass at the base of pampas grass, loving thoughts persist even when it's not autumn
　　　　　　Aritoshi
Even appearing cold in dreams, these love-robes whose tears don't dry even while sleeping
　　　　　　Shōyū
At the roadside shrine of love's mountain path so hard to cross, I offered my heart as sacred strips and wore it away completely
　　　　　　Iwaki
Eight
I cannot think there would be any worth in Lake Ōmi - this body that passes the night without seaweed to see you
　　　　　　Shōyū
I wish I could make a path of connection across the river of thoughts in the dust that accumulates nightly on my pillow
Awa　　　　Teruaki
No use in waiting, wet with tears, even the wooden pillow's mountain has become rotting thoughts
Kan'onji　　　Moromitsu
Hiding white teeth from people, I'll pray to the god of Togakushi while setting up pear trees
Echigo　　　　Chikushōen
Could I exchange the coldness for the dream in which we met, and find a way to make dreams reality?
Shibata　　　Yasumaru
To lament the lack of divine signs despite prayers - you who are not divine surely don't know this
Sakai　　　　Hayaki
Maidenflowers swaying freely with the blowing wind - if only the lord I love were like that
Same　　　　Shigeki
Even the joyful dew on sleeves during nights we meet turns to sorrow when dawn comes
Wakayama　　　Kakusuke
With the ever-green colored willow as my heart, how joyful were the nights we swayed together
Ōsaka　　　　Haruomi
Let forget-me-grass burden my body, if there's no sign that Sumiyoshi god has answered prayers
Same　　　　Morichika

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Thirty-four
Taking separation as the limit of this sorrowful world, these tears of mine know no reason at all
Ōsaka　　　　Yukio
Since my thoughts are as deep as Ariso sea, the shells of forgetting love are hard to gather
Ōtsu　　　　Suzuo
Has my heart gone many times to invite you? The face-shadow of you whom I can only think about
Gifu　　　　Kamikakiuchi
The guiding thread of summer-drawing has broken completely - I'm in love with nowhere to turn
Nagoya　　　　Ben'ben'kyo
Having been abandoned, lamenting - perhaps there's no one to ask after this body on love's mountain path
Tsu　　　　　Tomojiku
Love grass or field pampas grass - having begun to meet, thoughts have become confused
Mitsuke　　　　Kusa-no-ya
Since you coldly don't come to Matsuyama's pines, my sleeves have now become wave-crossing ones
Tōmori　　　　Masue
Relying on promised words of "a thousand years," I fold cranes while waiting for that person
Kakegawa　　　Baibu
Because we can meet, parting is this sad - even the resentment of the past when we didn't meet
Kōfu　　　　Matsura
Adding the crying wild goose's tears, the bed-night of two sleeping together separates in the sky of layered robes
Zaikō　　　　Mentaka
I feel as if grass and trees might speak - the floating reputation that stirs on love's mountain path
Kurashina　　　Tei
On nights we meet, even the bell saying "sleep" is hushed, and I'm too happy to speak
　　　　　　Same
In my troubled heart too, on nights when clouds pass, the brief shower on sleeves fell coldly
Buttō　　　　Gekki
Now there's only someone to protect, they say - hearing this faintly from the autumn fields makes me even more resentful
Kami-Ichinomiya　　　Ume-toji
　　　　Refined elegance

Once washed, the maple leaves' colors surpass brocade in the rain for tomorrow's practice
Wakamaru, Fusaya

Like the number of blooming flowers, may we layer a thousand generations. How many combinations there are in the chrysanthemum cups
Same, Utao

Even the white chrysanthemums have faded completely, and even the hedge turns to frost - autumn's farewell
Sakai, Hayaki

How sad it is to hear the geese's cries. Though it's not a letter listing painful things

If there had been no rain clouds, I wouldn't have let my heart leak out to the autumn night moon
Osaka, Tsunekai

Longing for his mate, he must wring out even his body's oil - the stag living in distant Onori fields
Nagahama, Satō

Though the first geese's crossing hasn't come yet, who brought the moon treading here this morning?
Shigaraki, Kachōya

Looking at the end of the moon entering and leaving Musashi plains, it lies at the edge of the pampas grass waves
Gifu, Kamigakien

Pathos presses upon my solitary body and I hear it - are these insects that limit themselves only to my house?
Nagoya, Tatsunoya

When autumn comes, the thin threads of pampas grass weave pine needle robes. Even the "させと" insects are singing

The sky clears and I feel as if I can see the stars. White chrysanthemums following the misty hedge
Narita, Fumihiko

Hearing the pine crickets in the fields where we celebrated the Day of the Rat - will this autumn night feel like a thousand years have passed?
Same

On the true bush clover of the dewy fields, the stag's nightly pillow must be wet as he cries
Same, Baikimi

The autumn leaves dye themselves the color of love. The shower pours down with no fixed pattern in the sky
Matsudo, Akimura

Because I planted them, the grass sleeves are dewy. Both insects and deer sing through the night in the fields
Honjō, Takikei

The harmonious hammering of men and women - the night fulling blocks in the wind, distant yet near
Edosaki, Ryokujuen

At dusk, the moon's reflection lodges on the sea plain - its master was in the waves' flowers
Ōta, Tsumitaru

Even wet deer stand there, yet I won't call the lower maple leaves a straw raincoat, even if showers fall
Shiseido

Who holds the incomparable true jewel of the moon placed in heaven and earth's twilight?
Man'ginsha

The owl hoots - autumn days are long, not knowing evening has come, making excuses to the moon
Shū'ginsha

There's good reason to blame the snow of the shining moon. The field where the ice house's surface began to form
Rokkyōen

Looking at the rustling reed plains, should we see the wind's lodging as existing only here?
Shinrai

The reeds of Tamae that should rise have withered completely - did they tie the dew into frost instead?

More moving than the paulownia tree. The maple leaves beginning to scatter, though they are the same single leaf

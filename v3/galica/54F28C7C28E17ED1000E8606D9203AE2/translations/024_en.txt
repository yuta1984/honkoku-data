Since that night when the cuckoo rarely came to visit, even my ageless body has grown hoarse of voice

Wondering if the crying cicadas' voices shower autumn colors, I saw it was the evening sun in the treetops

Like entering water where gold cannot be distinguished, fireflies that shine distant from the moon

The cicadas' sound showers elsewhere, and sleeves are wetted by the summer day's roof leak

Wind rustles gently, shadows filtering through young leaf waves - how cool the garden where moon strikes water

Cuckoo, on this summer night when even the iris doesn't know, where do you go abandoning my lodging?
Koyama　　　　Azegusa
The cuckoo calling from beyond the moon - does it cry lamenting its fall from the capital?

Even my heartless body amid autumn leaves, leaving the green branch persimmons and lamenting like Sarumarou

【Minamoto no Tsunemoto Hearing the Reports】
Thus in the capital, while there had been rumors of disturbances in the eastern provinces, the actual situation had not yet been heard, and people wondered what might be happening.
At that point, Prince Minamoto no Tsunemoto arrived in the capital and gave a detailed report to the throne about the course of the war in the eastern provinces. At the same time, a swift messenger arrived from the western provinces, reporting urgently: "Fujiwara no Sumitomo, Governor of Iyo, has again gathered his remaining followers and built a fortress at a place called Kamashima in Bizen Province, and his influence extends throughout the neighboring provinces."

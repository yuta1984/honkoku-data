[Prince Sadazumi bestowing the sword]
Prince Tsunemoto respectfully received the honor, but humbly declined several times, saying "The position of great general does not befit my abilities." However, as the imperial command could not be refused, he finally accepted the appointment. This truly appeared most admirable. This was indeed the proper way for the great ancestor of the Minamoto clan, the authentic manner befitting the founder of this distinguished lineage, and there was no one who did not praise this as exactly how it should be.

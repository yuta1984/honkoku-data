[Masakado and Sumitomo]
As he had been sitting there for a long time, Sumitomo found this strange and asked him the reason. Masakado said, "This Heian-kyō has been the seat of successive imperial branches since Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to this location in the twelfth year of Enryaku. Though I too was born of Kanmu's lineage, it is regrettable that I should waste away like a common servant. I have something in mind. Will you join me?" Sumitomo, being a greedy and hot-blooded warrior, immediately agreed, and from then on they began plotting rebellion. That Masakado later raised troops at the same time stems from this moment.

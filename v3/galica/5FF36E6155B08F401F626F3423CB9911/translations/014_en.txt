[Messengers celebrating the birth]
Prince Tsunemoto's wife was the daughter of Tachibana no Atsuyari, Governor of Musashi Province. She showed signs of pregnancy, and when her time came, on the 10th day of the 4th month of Engi 12 (912), at the Nishi-Hachijō Palace, she gave birth safely to a male child. This young prince would later be called Tada no Mitsunaka and become an excellent general skilled in both literary and military arts. The joy of his grandfather the prince and his father the king goes without saying.

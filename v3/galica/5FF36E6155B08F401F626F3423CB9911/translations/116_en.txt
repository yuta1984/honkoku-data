【The Capture of Sakanoue no Chikataka and Fujiwara no Haruaki】
Sakanoue no Chikataka and Fujiwara no Haruaki were both trusted retainers of Masakado, and had built a fortress in Hitachi Province to serve as reinforcements for Masayori. However, when they heard that their allies had been defeated and Masayori had been killed in battle, they planned to return to their home province. They enticed a lowly peasant woman to come with them, dressed her in fine silk, placed her in a palanquin, and disguised themselves as servants. As they passed in front of the prosperous government office, the guards became suspicious and stopped them as suspicious persons.

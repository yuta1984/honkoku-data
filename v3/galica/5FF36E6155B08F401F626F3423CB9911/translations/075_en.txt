【Warriors Capturing Spies】
They had infiltrated and planned to set fires on a windy night and launch a surprise attack from within the castle, but somehow this plot was overheard. It was suspected that there were spies from the enemy side within the castle. They decided to search using identification tokens, and each unit was inspected. Originally, according to the rules of this castle, identification tokens were made from white cloth two shaku long and five sun wide, kept in the upper belt over the armor as ally identification markers. Indeed, there were as many as twelve men who did not possess these tokens.

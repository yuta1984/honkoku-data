[Sumitomo Subduing the Bandits]
Sumitomo awoke at this, but the lamp had gone out and it was pitch black. Using the sound of footsteps as his guide, he desperately grappled and wrestled with them. There were two bandits while Sumitomo was only one person, so he could barely handle them, but he managed to pin down the robbers. When he called out "Wake up, men!" his retainers and young attendants came rushing together and, piling on top of each other, bound the bandits hand and foot. When they lit a lamp and looked inside the cabin, all the furnishings and gold and silver had been stolen without exception, so Sumitomo became greatly enraged, bound the bandits tightly, and returned to his home province.

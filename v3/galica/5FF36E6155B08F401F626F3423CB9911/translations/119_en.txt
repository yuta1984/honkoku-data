【The Chaotic Battlefield with Flying Arrows】
Seeing the enemy waver, they pushed open the castle gates and charged out all at once with a great roar. Though Hidesato and Sadamori were brave at heart, they could not withstand this fierce assault and retreated in confusion. Masakado's general, Gon-no-kami Okiyo, led his troops and cut through in all directions, causing the attacking army to fall into even greater disorder and chaos. They fled in all directions, and it appeared that Sadamori and Hidesato themselves were about to be killed, but they barely managed to break through. They retreated more than one ri and established a camp, gathering their defeated forces, but the surviving soldiers numbered fewer than ten thousand.

[Pirates Departing from Sumitomo's Ship]
Fujiwara no Sumitomo was waiting for favorable winds on the sea off Muro in Banshū province while traveling down to his home province of Iyo. Sumitomo and all his retainers, rocked by the ship, fell fast asleep, unaware of their surroundings. At that moment, several dozen pirates entered the cabin, perhaps thinking it was a merchant vessel. They seized everything—gold, silver, clothing, and furnishings—loaded it all onto their own ship, and departed to parts unknown. Only two men who appeared to be the pirate leaders remained behind, attempting to steal a suit of armor called "Fujimaru" that Sumitomo had treasured, but one of them stumbled and fell face-down.

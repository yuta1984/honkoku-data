【Beautiful Women Attending the Banquet】
As they were sent as gifts, an enormous number of beautiful women adorned themselves with flowers, dressed in brocade robes, fluttered their sleeves of fine silk, softened their voices, and sang elegant songs. The scene was so magnificent that it seemed comparable to the three thousand beauties competing in charm at the Abō Palace on Mount Shu. Some had been torn from their parents' affection, forcibly separated from their matrimonial bonds, and grieved over unnatural partings. The number of beautiful women was so great—hundreds upon hundreds—that it was impossible to count them all.

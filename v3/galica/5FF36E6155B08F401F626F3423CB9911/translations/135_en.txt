【The Ceremony of Court Appointments】
【Upper section】
The appointments included the governorship of Kōzuke province, and in addition, according to military merit, territories of five or ten locations were granted, with no one left without confirmation of their holdings.

【Lower section】
Masakado's rebellion, which began in the second year of Shōhei and lasted nine years until the present third year of Tengyō, during which he wielded power throughout the Bandō region, could not escape divine punishment and was destroyed in an instant—truly a most auspicious outcome.

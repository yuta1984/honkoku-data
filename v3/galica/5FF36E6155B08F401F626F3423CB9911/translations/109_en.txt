【Masayori Pierced by an Arrow】
Having cast off his armor and equipment, Masayori took his sword in reverse grip, intending to commit suicide. At that moment, among the arrows raining down like precipitation, one arrow pierced deeply into Masayori's left side. Already exhausted from battle, he could not endure even for a moment longer, and immediately collapsed and died on the spot. Chiharu gathered the enemy heads, raised victory cries, and returned to the main camp.

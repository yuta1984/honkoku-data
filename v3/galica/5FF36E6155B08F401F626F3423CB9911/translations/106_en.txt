【Hitachi no Suke Genmō Opening His Fan at Masayori's Camp Across the Tone River】
That day, the battle ended at nightfall in a draw. From around the Hour of the Ox (about 2 AM), heavy rain fell as if washing away cart axles, and since it still had not stopped the next day, both armies sent military envoys to suspend the fighting and waited for the rain to clear. That night, there was an accident in Masayori's camp and a fire broke out in the administrative building. Unfortunately, the east wind was fierce, and the flames were blown in all directions. Thinking "Now comes the night attack!" they raised an uproar and began fighting among themselves. Seeing this, Hidesato and Sadamori said, "There must be a spy among the enemy forces. Now is the time to raise our war cries together and charge!" Following this command, the enemy became even more confused and lost their composure.

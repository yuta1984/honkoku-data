[The situation at the imperial palace]
The joy throughout the imperial palace was shared not only by the imperial family and nobility, but daimyo and lesser lords from all provinces brought gifts of fine silk brocades, gold and silver, horses, and saddles, each trying to outdo the others in offering their congratulations. Truly, these were matters that were praised as signs of the prosperity of the Genji (Minamoto) clan.

【The Woman Who Was the Incarnation of a Great Serpent Living at Seta Bridge】
Here there was a man called Tawara Tōta Hidesato, the military governor (ōryōshi) of Shimotsuke Province. His house was wealthy, his clan extensive, and there was none in the eastern provinces who could match him. In the early years of the Shōhei era, when he was living in Ōmi Province, as he was crossing the Seta Bridge, a great serpent over twenty jō in length lay sprawled across the bridge. Hidesato showed not the slightest fear and roughly trampled across the serpent's back as he passed. Then a beautiful woman appeared and said, "I am one who dwells beneath this bridge."

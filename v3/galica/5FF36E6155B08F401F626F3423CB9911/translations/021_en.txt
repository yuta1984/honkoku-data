[A retainer speaks about Masakado]
When they came closer and looked carefully, it was Kojirō Masakado. How strange indeed! This ostentatious procession inappropriate to his station surely reveals his treasonous intentions. They should report this to His Majesty (the Emperor or Retired Emperor) and have him swiftly punished. Though they repeatedly urged this course of action, thinking it was merely private prejudice arising from discord within the clan, no one would listen to them at all. But later, they would realize how prescient these words had been.

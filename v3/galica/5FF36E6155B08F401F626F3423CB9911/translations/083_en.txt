【The Great King Welcomes Hidesato】
He smeared saliva on the arrowhead and shot it through from the center of the eyebrows down to below the throat. The Dragon King was greatly pleased and gave Hidesato a sword, armor, rolled silk, and especially one small rice bale. Inside this bale were stored gold, silver, rice, and coins without limit, and no matter how much one took and used, it would never be exhausted. From this time on, people of the world came to call him Tawara Hidesato (Rice Bale Hidesato). He was truly a most blessed warrior.

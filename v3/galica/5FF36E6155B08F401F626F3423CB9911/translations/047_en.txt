[The Brothers Suminori and Sumiyuki Fighting Valiantly]

Wielding an oak staff of over eleven jō in length as if it were light as a feather, the younger brothers Suminori and Sumiyuki, with thirty-seven mounted retainers in formation, rode out to attack, pursuing and retreating seven or eight times in battle. The imperial army was routed by this and scattered in disarray. At this moment, the flanking attack force infiltrated the castle, set fires, and cut their way out. Sumitomo, realizing "this is the end," broke through one direction and escaped. After that, his fate remained unknown.

[Sumitomo presenting the imperial edict]
Saying "Listen!", he took out the imperial edict he had prepared beforehand and read it aloud. The greedy and audacious pirates jumped for joy and readily accepted, saying "We will spread word throughout the provinces, gather allied forces, and rush to join you without delay." Sumitomo was greatly pleased and rewarded them with ten ryō of gold and swords to honor their service.

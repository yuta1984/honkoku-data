[Pirates brought out to the garden]
After Sumitomo returned to his home province, he had been troubling his mind day and night with plotting conspiracies, but suddenly having an idea, he brought out to the garden the pirates he had captured alive on that ship, softened his expression and said:
"Prince Taira Masakado has raised righteous troops in the eastern provinces, and his power is widely known throughout the eight Kantō provinces. I have been entrusted by this lord and intend to raise my banner in this province. If you wish for future wealth and honor, you should gather your companions and devote yourselves to military service. Respectfully observe the imperial edict bestowed by the Prince."

[Portents and Natural Disasters: People Wonder at Strange Phenomena]
On the twenty-seventh day of the fifth month of Shōhei 4, fierce whirlwinds blew through the capital, whipping up sand and hurling stones, making it impossible to distinguish even what was within arm's reach.
As people wondered anxiously what manner of supernatural change this might portend, the earth shook so violently from southwest to northeast that it seemed the very ground would collapse. Not only common dwellings but also the solemnly erected shrines and Buddhist temples all crumbled without exception.
Then suddenly water gushed forth and filled the heavens, mountains split and filled the valleys, flowing like spilled ink.

【Tawara Hidesato Requesting an Audience with Taira no Masakado】
Hidesato pondered deeply: Masakado has brought the eight provinces of Kantō under his control, and even Lord Tsunemoto has lost track of him. First, I shall go to his mansion to observe whether he displays such arrogance. When Hidesato arrived at Masakado's mansion and requested an audience, Masakado was greatly delighted and invited Hidesato into the guest quarters. At that moment, as was his custom, he was having his hair combed by a courtesan, but in his excessive joy, he did not even arrange his disheveled hair, hastily pulled on his court cap in great confusion, and rushed out in a flustered state to meet him - such was his appearance.

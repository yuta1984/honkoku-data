【A White Bird Flying Out from Hikawa Shrine】
Jōheidai Sadamori arrived in Musashi Province on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, ahead of the military governor. He met with his younger brothers Shigemori and Kanetō, and set out with a force of over eight hundred mounted warriors. They visited Hikawa Shrine, offered written prayers, and the brothers respectfully worshipped there. At that moment, a white bird flew out from the shrine altar and fluttered gracefully above their banners.

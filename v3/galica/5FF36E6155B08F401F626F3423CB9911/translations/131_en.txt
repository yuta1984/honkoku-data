【Arakawa Yahachirō Attempting to Take Masatame's Head】
Yahachirō of Arakawa, younger brother of Yagorō, saw this and came running. He slashed Masatame's face five or six inches deep. As Masatame flinched from the wound, Yahachirō folded up his kusazuri armor and stabbed through him with three sword strikes, pulled him down, severed his head, and returned to his own camp.

After fighting for fourteen days in total, Masakado's entire clan and followers were completely destroyed, and the eastern provinces had already returned to peace.

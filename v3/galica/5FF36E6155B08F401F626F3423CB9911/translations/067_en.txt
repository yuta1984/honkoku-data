【The Empty Shell of Tsuchiura Castle】
The situation had become utterly hopeless. Since their general had already been killed, everyone fled one after another, and now it was impossible to face the enemy from this castle. They tied only flags to the watchtower and escaped under cover of night. Masakado led a great army and pressed forward, raising war cries, but there was no sound at all from within the castle. The attacking forces did not approach carelessly either, but surrounded the castle and observed the situation. A resident of Awa Province named Nagasa Shichirō Yasutoki approached the base of the outer fence and looked up. When he heard the sound of birds flapping their wings in the gaps of the fence above the watchtower, he thought, "Just as I suspected, this is an empty castle with no one in it." Using a shield board as a ladder, he climbed smoothly up onto the fence and quietly surveyed the interior of the castle. There was not a single enemy to be found. He then pushed open the castle gates and beckoned his allied forces, whereupon the great army entered the castle and made camp.

[Sumitomo and Masakado]
There was also a man called Fujiwara no Sumitomo, Governor of Iyo Province. While residing in the capital, he was visiting Mount Hiei when he encountered Masakado in front of the Central Hall.
They scattered the lunch boxes and other provisions they had brought with them and held a drinking party.
Masakado gazed down at distant Heian-kyō and let out a long sigh.

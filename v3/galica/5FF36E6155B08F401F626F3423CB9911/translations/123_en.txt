【Soldiers Fleeing in Confusion Before Sadayo's Might】
A great multitude of soldiers was cut down by Sadayo alone and scattered fleeing in all directions. Since Sadayo had resolved to die in battle, he did not retreat even one step, looking around for worthy opponents to grapple with, but terrified by his valor, no one dared approach him—they only shot arrows from a distance. The arrows standing in his body were as numerous as rain-coat grass, and he died standing upright, using his sword reversed as a walking stick to support himself.

【Sadamori Shoots an Arrow at Masakado】
Since Taira no Sadamori sought to avenge his father, he aimed to shoot Masakado with a single arrow. Drawing his thirteen-sok three-fuse bow to its full extent, he called out and released the arrow with force. It struck directly in the center of Masakado's forehead, shattering his brain and standing firm. Though he was truly a peerless fierce general, since it hit a vital spot, his vision darkened and he fell heavily from his horse. Fujiwara no Hidesato came running over.

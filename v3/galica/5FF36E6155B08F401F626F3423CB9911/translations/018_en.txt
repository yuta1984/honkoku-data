The sixty-first emperor, known as Emperor Suzaku, was the eleventh prince of Emperor Daigo. In the eighth year of Enchō, in the eleventh month, at the age of eight, he ascended to the throne and changed the era name to Jōhei. In the autumn of the second year of that era, a male deer suddenly leaped out from nowhere in the artificial hill garden of the Seiryōden (Imperial Palace), and jumped toward the Emperor's sacred body. The court nobles were thrown into confusion and panic, each drawing their swords in haste.

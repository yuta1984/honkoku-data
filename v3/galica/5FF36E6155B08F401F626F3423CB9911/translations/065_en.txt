【Masakado Releases His Arrow】
Mounting his horse with its white-trimmed saddle and leaning on his bow staff, he declared: "That warrior positioned over there appears to be General Kunika. Take this arrow!" With that, he drew his bowstring with a high twang and released it. The arrow pierced through the breastplate of Kasama Yukikuni who stood in the line of fire, and drove deep into General Kunika's right breast below the nipple, standing there embedded. It was such a grievous wound that he tumbled heavily from his horse. Thereupon Masakado's forces all at once raised a great war cry and charged forward, so that the number of those struck down was beyond counting.

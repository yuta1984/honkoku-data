If there were bandits filling the entire three-thousand-great-thousand-world system, and a merchant leader was traveling with many merchants, carrying precious treasures through dangerous roads, one person among them would speak out loud saying: "Good men, do not be afraid. You should single-mindedly call upon the name of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. This Bodhisattva can bestow fearlessness upon all sentient beings. If you call upon this name, you will obtain liberation from these bandits." The many merchants, hearing this, all raised their voices together saying "Namo Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva." By calling upon this name, they immediately obtained liberation.

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma
Chapter 25: The Universal Gate of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva

At that time, the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, joined his palms together, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, for what reason is the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara called 'Avalokiteśvara' (Observer of the Sounds of the World)?" The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati: "Good son, if immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of living beings who are experiencing various sufferings hear of this Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and single-mindedly call upon the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will immediately perceive their voices and free them all from their sufferings."

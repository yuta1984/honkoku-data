If hundreds of thousands of millions of sentient beings should enter the great ocean seeking treasures such as gold, silver, lapis lazuli, giant clamshells, agate, coral, amber, pearls, and other precious things, even if black winds should blow their ships and cast them adrift to the land of rakshasa demons, if among them there should be even one person who calls upon the name of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, then all these people will be delivered from the calamity of the rakshasas. For this reason, he is called Avalokiteshvara (Observer of the Sounds of the World).

Prelude to the First Drawing of Spring Mist

The rustling voices of pine and bamboo standing richly across the broad avenue
Deep in spring, the first drawing of mist in all directions brings forth a thousand generations of precious children
The first cockcrow followed by the second, then Sanbaso - what joy there is!
Embraced tightly in the dawn light, sacred rope decorations of white-backed ferns and pine
The affair of great fondness for the daphne stand bounces like a temari ball
In good rhythm, countless days and nights

Wang Wei and Li Sixun must have also been skilled at painting skylights. Now,
since these manga became popular in the world, for booksellers they have been
like big fortune rice cakes, and in the still-warm season of opening the hearth, that is like the boar day and
rat day rice cakes combined into one, and not only that, but with three made into
two, reaching the sixth volume, they requested a preface from me. Comparing this to rice cakes, whatever comes from the mouth, I leave it to the brush
to write freely. Written by Shokusan-jin, a lover of rice cakes and hater of sake, a teetotaler,
at Bunpōdō.

Writing is a tool that penetrates the Way, and painting is a tool that conveys form.
However, if writing is clumsy, how could it penetrate the Way? If painting is unskillful, it naturally cannot convey form. This is like drawing a tiger that ends up resembling a dog. When Hokusai drew all manner of things, they all truly conveyed their forms, such that even a three-year-old child could look at them and recognize what the objects were.

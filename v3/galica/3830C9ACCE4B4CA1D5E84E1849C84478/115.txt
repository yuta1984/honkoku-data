　　Eleventh Dialogue
1 Mr E. is very polite
for when I was last with him
he  punished a black boy.
I asked him the reason, or what fouls the boy
had committed.
He answered.
You came this morning to  me.
He told you then
I was not at home.
He deceived you by telling I went out so
early.
It is for this I punished him.
I could not answer
as I was much asham'd
He is too polite.
2 I got a few days ago a book  and a
wax candle, but have not been to return my
thanks.
3 From whom have you got that?
4  I got it from my Master.
5 I  guessed that it came from your father, or from 
your mother 
6 Why so?
7 It is a good hint.

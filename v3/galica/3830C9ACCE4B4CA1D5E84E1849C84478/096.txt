32 What is the reason why the Dutch who formerly
have been trading at the Island   Filando have
left that  Factory, and have established them-
selves here?
33 I do not well know the reason, however I
have been told, it  was because
the town of Nagasaki is the principal of
the Emperors domains, and particularly because
it was well situated for trade.
34  I conceive it at present: how many miles is Japan from Batavia?
35  About ----miles.
36 I believe  the Dutch in their voyage to Japan【Japonの訂正と推測】
 are often exposed to dangers.
37 It is  as you observe,  for some years ago, a
ship,  after suffering much in a storm, was
thrown on the Island of Goto.
38 In what manner was the wreck wrought. 
39 It was  hauled hither from Gotho, and was
broken down here, to be sold.
40  Of what use were  the beams & planks?
41 They were employed in  the construction of barks【バーク型小型帆船】. 
42 I must go.
43 Chat a little , stay a little longer.
44 Time  forces me to go.
45  Why?
46 I dine to day【today】  with N.
47 Do you know him too?
48 Yes, I know him very well.

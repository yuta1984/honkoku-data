11 I was angry with you.
12 I beg you will pardon me.
13 I pardon you, as you did not know it.
14 What ailed you?
15 I have been much indisposed by a flux.
16 How many days have you been in bed?
17 Nearly seventy-five days.
18 I think you feel yourself very weak.
19 Yes, on account of that I have wished for
somebody to dissipate my grief.
20 But why did you not send for me?
21 How could I insist on your coming to see me,
being indisposed?
22 Am I not then your friend?
23 Yes.
24 What is then the reason of it?
25 Don't you not conceive it yet?
26 No, my good friend.
27 True friends are tried in need.
28 I know that, but am not afraid of it.
29 It is but a jest.
30 I pay you my compliments on your speedy
recovery.
31 I am very much obliged to you.
32 Have you seen N?
33 No, I have not seen him for a long while.
34 He is married.
35 Who has he married?
36 The daughter of M.
37 Has she brought him some money in marriage? 
Or, has he got some money with her?

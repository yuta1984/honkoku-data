16 Very well.
17 Take this letter to him.
18 Very well, but what shall I do with the letter if I don't find him at home?
19 Then ask his wife where he is, and bring it to him.
20 I understand, I shall go then.
21 Return quickly, and don't dawdle in the city.
22 Ah, welcome! I was about to send you a letter.
23 About what?
24 I received a beautiful gift from N. just a moment ago.
25 What did you receive?
26 A pair of ducks and a large bream.
27 That's a superb gift.
28 That's why I want to celebrate with you and prepare it myself.
29 Very well, I'll go fetch the pastry dough and eggs then.
30 Please do.
31 Do you have brown sugar?
32 N. will bring some.
33 Is he coming too?
34 Yes.
35 I'll go home then.
36 Why is that?
37 Because I went out so early this morning.

71 I believe that you too will spend a lot of money during the journey,
going to taverns when not on duty,
and that you will amuse yourself greatly with the
Tayu (courtesans of the first class) and other
women.

72 You are mocking me.
How can one, whatever one might say, amuse
oneself thus during the journey?
We do not have time every year to
amuse ourselves,
but are all tired as there is so much to do,
and often we must rise earlier
and go to bed later.

73 Certainly that could be so.

74 What time is it now?

75 It is past seven o'clock Japanese time.

76 Past seven Japanese time, that is past four
o'clock Dutch time, is it not?

77 Yes, I have a Dutch watch,
so I know very well that among the
Dutch, day and night have twenty-four
hours, which are divided into twelve among the
Japanese,
as you know,
thus each hour is reduced by half,
and each is counted as a half.

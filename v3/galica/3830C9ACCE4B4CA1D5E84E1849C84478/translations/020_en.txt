38 There's no need for you to return.
39 I'm going to inquire about the outcome of a certain matter.
40 Then I'll wait for you, come back quickly.
41 Very well, until we meet again.

Seventh Dialogue
Between Two Friends

1 Yesterday around four o'clock I went to see N.
2 It had been about five days since I last visited him.
3 He told me so.
4 I was going to go the day before yesterday, but didn't go because urgent business arose unexpectedly.
5 Then why didn't you come yesterday? What was the reason?
6 Yesterday there were several banquets and feasts.
7 Who hosted the feast?
8 N. received a beautiful gift from elsewhere yesterday.
9 What did he receive?
10 A pair of ducks and a large bream.
11 Ah, that's very good for preparing oneself.
12 Yes, he prepared it.
13 I'm very envious of not having been there.
14 That's how it is.
15 How many people did you feast with?
16 I was there with him, and one other person.
17 I believe you drank a lot.
18 Yes, I drank until ten o'clock at night, and from there I went to the house of Naka no tsu-koegaya(?), to Itara the tannedon.

36 Farewell until tonight.
37 I wish you a good day.

Eleventh Dialogue
1 Mr. E. is very polite,
for when I last visited him,
he was punishing a black servant boy.
I asked him the reason, or what fault the boy
had committed.
He answered:
"You came to visit me this morning.
At that time he (the servant)
told you I was not at home.
He deceived you by lying that I had gone out so
early.
It is for this that I punished him."
I could not answer
as I was much ashamed.
He is too polite.

2 I received a book and a
wax candle a few days ago, but have not yet gone to express my
thanks.

3 From whom did you receive that?

4 I received it from my master.

5 I guessed that it came from your father, or from
your mother.

6 Why did you think so?

7 It was a good guess.

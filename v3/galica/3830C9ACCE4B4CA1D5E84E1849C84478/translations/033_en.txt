17 With your permission, I will sit there then.
18 Please make yourself comfortable.
19 Please take the soup, if you will.
20 I will first taste this sake, and then offer it to you.
21 To your health.
I will drink to your health.
22 I am much obliged to you.
23 Please drink a full cup, and then give it to my son and daughter, if you please.
24 Excuse me, I will give it to them then.
25 My son and daughter, offer it to the gentleman after drinking.
26 I cannot drink so much.
27 Drink one more cup, and nothing more.
28 I cannot go anywhere if I drink it.
29 It will not intoxicate you even if you drink one or two more cups.
30 Look at me, how red I am becoming! This is a sign of intoxication.
31 Do you not wish to drink anymore then?
32 No, I thank you.
33 I thank you for your hospitality.
34 Forgive me for having received you so poorly, or do not take it badly that I have received you so poorly.
35 You are too polite.
36 I bid you farewell then.

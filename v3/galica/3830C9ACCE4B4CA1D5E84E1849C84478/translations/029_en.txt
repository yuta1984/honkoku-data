Mr. N called me to tell me a story from Miyako (Kyoto).

Is that where you drank so much?

Yes, after the story was finished, I enjoyed myself with Mr. N.

But that's not where I drank so much.
Because a letter came from Mr. A.
That's why I didn't stay there for lunch.

Being in June, the drink took hold of me so quickly.

What's new at the Government?

I haven't learned anything, but a courier has arrived from Edo, and the Governor has not yet changed his position.

Is it possible?

Yes.

When did this news come to the Government?

Mr. N told me it came yesterday.

When did he leave Edo last year - at the end of the twelfth month, or at the beginning of the New Year?

I don't know exactly, but annually on the second day of the New Year, a courier departs from Edo for here.

　　Twelfth Dialogue

1 Welcome.

2 I feel so isolated today because of the continuous rain, that's why I cannot stay at home.

3 Come in, it's better and more amusing to chat with a friend on a rainy day than to go out.

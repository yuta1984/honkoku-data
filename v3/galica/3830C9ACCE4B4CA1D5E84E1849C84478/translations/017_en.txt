31 Then please be so kind as to hurry as much as you can.
32 Good, I'll be back in a moment.
　　　With Another Friend
33 Welcome, my good friend.
34 I learned from N that you will go with him to the theater today.
35 Yes, but it's not certain yet.
36 For what reason?
37 He's going to Dejima today.
38 You're making fun of me.
39 No, I'm telling you the truth.
40 From whom did you learn this?
41 He told me himself.
42 Has he been to your place?
43 Yes, just now.
44 Has he already left for Dejima?
45 No, he's presently at N's place, asking him to replace him.
46 Will he come back?
47 Yes, would you like to wait for his return?
48 Yes, but I would accompany you if he doesn't go.
49 Nevertheless, you could go with us, as I would like us to be three.
50 Please do.
51 Ah, you're back quickly. What did he tell you?
52 He cannot do it.
53 Why is that?
54 He went there yesterday, and besides, he finds himself a bit unwell today.

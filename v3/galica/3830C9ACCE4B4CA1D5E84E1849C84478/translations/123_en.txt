54 Who will have the superintendence this year?
55 Mr. N.N.
56 He is a good man.
57 I think we will have little trouble during the whole voyage, as he is so well acquainted with everything.
58 I think so too.
59 How often have you been on the voyage to the court?
60 I have been to Edo three times last year. We had a very dangerous passage due to a storm in the sea between Shimonoseki and Hyogo. A fazimaroe (a large vessel) had nearly foundered, but was saved. We amused ourselves much at sea with fine weather and a favorable wind, but were much frightened when a storm came on. But the Dutch are not afraid of it as they are accustomed to the open sea.
61 True. I am frightened even by such a detail. I prefer to travel by land rather than by sea. The water is a fathomless gulf, and a hell for one who falls into the sea.

I drink to your health.
22 I am much obliged to you.
23 Please drink a full cup, then give it to my son and daughter.
24 You will excuse me, I will give it to them.
25 My son and daughter, after you have drunk, offer it to the gentleman.
26 I cannot drink so much.
27 Drink but one cup and no more.
28 If I drink it, I can go nowhere else.
29 If you drink one or two cups more, it will not affect you.
30 Look at me how red I become - it is proof that it affects me.
31 Will you then drink no more?
32 No, I thank you.
33 I thank you for your entertainment.
34 Pardon me for having received you so poorly,
or, don't take it amiss that I have received you so poorly.
35 You are too polite.
36 Farewell then.
37 Stay and chat a little longer.
38 Talk a while.

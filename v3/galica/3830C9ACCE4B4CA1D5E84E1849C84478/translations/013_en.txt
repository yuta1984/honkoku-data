13 I forgive you since you did not know about it.
14 What was your illness?
15 I was greatly troubled by diarrhea.
16 How many days were you bedridden?
17 About twenty-five days.
18 I believe you are much weakened.
19 Yes, that is why I desired someone to dispel my boredom.
20 But why did you not have me come?
21 How could I insist on you coming to see me while I was ill?
22 Am I not then your sincere friend?
23 Yes.
24 What then is the reason?
25 Do you not feel it yet?
26 No, my good friend.
27 True friends are tested in times of need.
28 I know that well, but do not fear it.
29 It is only banter.
30 I congratulate you on being recovered so soon.
31 I am infinitely obliged to you.

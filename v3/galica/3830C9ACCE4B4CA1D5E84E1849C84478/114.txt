12 His complaint is almost nothing, but he went 
partly for amusement.
13 I have not heard of it.
14 Nor I neither【Neither do I】, but I knew it because he told me.
15 We  have been guilty of  impoliteness towards ■【himヵ】.
16  T'is so, but it is a matter we were una-
quainted with.
17 It is  true, when does he return?
 18 I fancy about the end of this month.
19 It is a long stay.
20 Yes, I had a mind to come to you to day.
21  Why.
22 To day is my birthday.
23  I wish you joy.
24 On this account I  desire much to offer you a
cup of Zakki this evening.
25 I am much obliged to you.
26  Will you come to night?
27 Yes, I will come without fail.
28 I thank you.
29 On coming home,  I will send you a live brea■【breamヵ】,
 as a present. 
30 You ought not to give any thing, on the contrary
 I am asham'd.
31  But I give it only to compliment you.
32 If it pleases you then, but you must give me
a small one.
33 How  can I got 【get】a large one? At present 
on accoun of the bad weather it is very scarce.

[After the picture]
Your life span is one hundred and twenty years, while mine is forty thousand years. To suggest that you should die first - no matter how we pledge our bond for two lifetimes, how unbearably long would it be to wait forty thousand years for that reunion? Therefore, please, you must simply return to the capital. If I die in place of your life, then our pledge for two lifetimes will be fulfilled more quickly. If you were to die first, since there is no Buddhist law in this demon realm, your memorial services could not be performed. I am a demon's child with deep sins. Surely my sins must be profound. Nevertheless, if you would kindly come to pray for me, I may soon be reborn into a new life. Quickly, quickly, the Middle Captain should return to the capital

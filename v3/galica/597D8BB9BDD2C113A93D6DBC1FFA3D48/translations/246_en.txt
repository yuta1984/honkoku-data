I humbly write this letter. I have heard that you are in excellent health, which I find most gratifying.

First, regarding the matter of handing over Ako Castle, I instructed the retainers to ensure it proceeds without delay. However, as Lord Matsudaira Aki-no-kami and Lord Toda Uneme-no-sho have been making successive inquiries, I have completed giving instructions to avoid any mistakes. My younger brother Daigaku has been ordered into house confinement, but not knowing his safety, and with the retainers' departure from service, I cannot feel at ease and am in great difficulty. Ultimately, the retainers cannot settle their hearts in this situation. I believe this matter is unavoidable, but somehow I would like to seek connections among the officials in Edo to obtain forgiveness for Daigaku's house confinement, so that he may serve well in public thereafter. If this were accomplished, the retainers would also feel relieved. Therefore, though it is difficult for me to ask recently, I humbly request that you go down to Edo and arrange matters with the shogunate authorities.

Last night around seven o'clock, there were voices here and there as if there was a fire, so I went out to see.

After that, there was nothing particularly disturbing, so I left things as they were. There is nothing else to report. The above.

Last night around seven o'clock, there was some kind of disturbance that seemed like a fire or something, but before I could understand clearly what it was, it became quiet. I know nothing at all about what happened at that time. The above.

Regarding Maehara Isuke and Kanzaki Yogorō: These two men disguised themselves as merchants, repeatedly infiltrated the enemy's residence in secret, and observed the situation. This was naturally under Kuranosuke's direction. This stratagem was employed frequently.

Deserters recorded here:

Regarding Nakamura Seiemon, Suzuta Jūhachi, and Nakata Riheiji: These three men traveled together to Edo, but when they heard that the gossip back home [in Akō] had turned unfavorable, their faces changed color and they were greatly alarmed. Riheiji deserted on the 20th of last month, while Seiemon and Jūhachi fled under cover of darkness on the night of the 29th of last month. How disgraceful!

Regarding Oyamada Shōzaemon: This man stole kosode robes, money, and other items on the 2nd and then deserted. Needless to say [his behavior was contemptible].

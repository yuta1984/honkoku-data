Initially, it appeared they would respond with their full force, but perhaps due to the aforementioned warning, they somehow just put out many lanterns and stood guard. When withdrawing, Gengorōemon called out over the fence and bowed respectfully to the retainers of Lord Chikara and Lord Magotarō before withdrawing.

○First, though it is unknown who this person was, one man came cutting his way out with his sword and engaged Chikamatsu Kanroku in combat. When he struck two or three consecutive blows straight to the head, even the formidable Kanroku became dizzy and was forced into a defensive stance. While trying to cut his way toward the main group, he retreated. Kanroku called out "Where are you going, you coward!" and gave chase, but sustained wounds to his fingers and thigh, and moreover stumbled on a stone at the end of the garden and tumbled into the ornamental pond. His opponent pressed the attack, and just when it seemed Kanroku would be killed on the spot, perhaps thinking he had cut him down, the opponent withdrew. Kanroku got up, gave chase, and struck down that man.

Copy received on April 4th
I respectfully write to you. Regarding the unexpected incident involving Lord Takumi-no-kami, I am at a loss for words, though I dare to express my condolences. I deeply sympathize with your state of mind, and there is nothing appropriate I can say. I hope there are no particular troubles among you all. Lord Aki-no-kami has requested that I inquire about this. The officials appointed to take possession of your castle will arrive in the coming days, and at that time, I hope that all matters will be conducted with proper protocol and the castle handover will be completed without delay. I am sending messengers to each of you. I believe that the retainers of your domain will gradually withdraw, but I wonder if there are any impediments to this. I would also like to know about this matter. As the aforementioned messengers, I have appointed Inoue Dan'emon and Niwa Genbei, who departed from here this morning, so they will provide you with the details.

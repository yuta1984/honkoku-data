Takebayashi Tadashichi (Mashichirō) pierced him with a large spear, and Mashichirō (Takebayashi Tadashichi) cut off the head. Something seemed suspicious about the situation, so they examined the head by torchlight and saw it was an old man with shimohō hair style, and moreover the appearance of the corpse and clothing seemed to be that of Lord Kōzuke-no-suke, so they showed it to those who might recognize him.

Horibe Yasubē and Tomimori Sukeemon looked at it and (・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・) said "There should be a scar from two years ago," and when they looked, there was indeed a scar, and it was unmistakably Lord Kōzuke-no-suke. However, to be certain, they brought one of the enemy retainers they had captured and said "Is this not Lord Kōzuke-no-suke? If you do not answer honestly, we will strike you down in one blow." He replied "If you will spare my life, I will tell you," and said "Indeed, this is the head of my master, Lord Kōzuke-no-suke." Everyone was filled with boundless joy.

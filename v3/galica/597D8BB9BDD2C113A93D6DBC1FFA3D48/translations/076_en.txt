Regarding the matter of Takumi-no-kami-dono, is there nothing amiss on your end? Concerning this recent imperial directive, it would be appropriate to convey to all members of the household, down to the lowest ranks, that they should not act in defiance and that no disturbances should occur. Such are the circumstances. I humbly and respectfully state this.
　Third month, 28th day　Asano Tosa-no-kami Nagazumi (seal)

　　To Ōno Kurōbee-dono

○　Regarding the above matter, a copy of the letter from the senior retainer of Miyoshi to both men:
I take up my brush to write to you. Now, concerning the visit to Itō Goemon's place, Tosa-no-kami-dono has become aware of the sentiments of each of you, and while he considers the thoughts of all concerned to be unavoidable, by all means, without acting contrary to the imperial directive, ensure that no disturbances occur throughout the entire household, down to the lowest ranks

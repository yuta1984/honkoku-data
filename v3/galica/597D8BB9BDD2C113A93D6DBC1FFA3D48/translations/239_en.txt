reasonable indeed, but since Lord Daigaku is currently under house confinement, he is being cautious about all official government matters during this period, making it difficult to take action with government officials. However, the contents of the written petition can be brought to his attention in due course. The understanding of Lord Shōzaemon and Lord Hozaemon is generally reasonable, and we have acknowledged it. However, since intervention should be avoided during the period of house confinement, we believe there is no choice in the matter. Since we have not yet conveyed the greetings of both gentlemen to Kuranosuke, it is difficult to suppress the sentiments within the household. What Kuranosuke stated was that he wishes to submit a petition for intervention even during this period of house confinement, so he has once again set forth his intentions. We respectfully surmise that direct communication with government officials at this time would be difficult. The matter of lamenting the dissolution of your house clan may also be subject to government censure.

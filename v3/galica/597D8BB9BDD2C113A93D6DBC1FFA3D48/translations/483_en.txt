He served as an adopted son, and after the fall of Akō, he took refuge with his elder brother Samon (Chief of the Small Guard Unit). However, he went elsewhere on business. Thus, after the uprising of December 14th ended and two or three days passed, he returned and upon hearing of this situation, regretted not having participated in the attack with the others and committed suicide. One theory holds that because he had connections to the hatamoto, fearing that important matters might leak out, Kuranosuke did not include him among the participants. Another theory states that thinking he should not shamefully remain alive, he committed suicide upon the admonition of his parent and elder brother.

▢The matter reported to Samon's administrative office: Regarding Mokunosuke, whom I had adopted and was caring for - he had business and went to the Kamigata region this past November, and when he returned the day before yesterday, he committed suicide. Though we conducted various investigations, there were no written notes or anything left behind.

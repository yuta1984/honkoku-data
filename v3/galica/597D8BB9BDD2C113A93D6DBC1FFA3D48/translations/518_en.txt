the person sitting there said: "You must surely have heard about this - Asano Takumi-no-kami's retainers are launching a night attack tonight against Lord Kōzuke-no-suke to avenge their master. There is no cause for concern, so you may pass through. This is not something to watch as entertainment. Watching would not be good for anyone involved. If you absolutely must look, please watch from behind cover." So I observed from a distance. They surrounded the mansion at around half past nine. After about half an hour had passed, they beat drums and stormed through the main gate. Following that, they entered through the main gate carrying torches. Then for about an hour the sounds became quiet, with terrible crying of men and women heard, and the smell of blood was pungent. The crying continued for some time without stopping. After that, more than half remained outside the mansion, securing the perimeter. When they withdrew, about fifty people appeared to be heading toward Ekōin Temple.

Twelve foot soldiers　　　　　　　　　　　Ninety-two servants

Magobei and Kunaï broke through a wall to escape and hid in the house of a townsman named Kasaya Sanzaemon, an umbrella maker, across the street. After the incident was over, they escaped again through the same hole. The guards had spotted them beforehand. This became known when Sanzaemon reported the matter. It is said that Magobei, Kunaï, and Toneri conspired together to inflict wounds on their foreheads. Since these did not appear to be sword or spear wounds but looked like hairpin scratches, they were included among the uninjured.

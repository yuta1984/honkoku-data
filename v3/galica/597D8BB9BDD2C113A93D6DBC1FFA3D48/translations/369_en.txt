They brought it with them. The temple became agitated and first barred the gates firmly. All of them said: "As retainers of Asano Takumi-no-kami, we have this dawn struck down our late lord's enemy, Lord Kira, and come here. However, we do not seek to save our lives. Of course, we have no intention of causing any disturbance to your temple. We merely wish to offer Lord Kōzuke-no-suke's head at our late lord's grave. Please keep your gates barred until this ceremony is completed," they requested.

They immediately went directly to Lord Takumi-no-kami's grave, offered incense powder in the incense burner, drew water in a hand bucket, washed Lord Kōzuke-no-suke's head, and placed it on the second tier of the stone pagoda. Afterward, Kuranosuke made an announcement, and each man announced his pseudonym and real name, conducting what resembled an inspection. When this was finished, they all raised their voices together and were overcome with sorrowful tears. After this, they went to the abbot's quarters, where Kuranosuke met with the priest and explained everything in detail.

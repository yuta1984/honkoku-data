One: Verbal report of Ogawachi Rokurōzaemon, rear gate guard and foot soldier squad leader: I was on rear gate guard duty when a large group came and said "There is a fire inside the mansion, so open the gate." When I looked from the gate area, they had come in firefighting attire, but since there was no fire inside the mansion, I did not open the gate. Then they all broke down the gate and a large group entered. At that time it appeared to be firefighting equipment, but when I went out, I was wounded.

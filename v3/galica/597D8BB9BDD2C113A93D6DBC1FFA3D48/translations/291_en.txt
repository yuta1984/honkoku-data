and kinship relations. However, the fact that you keep this so strictly secret suggests that you ultimately view me as having an unreliable character, which I find regrettable," he spoke earnestly. Then Genshirō replied: "The gist of your words is entirely reasonable. I apologize for troubling you. There is nothing I should hide from you. Since Lord Aki-no-kami is of the same clan, it would be fine for him to know after we have broken with protocol. The reason I have not spoken to you about this is that I worry about future calamities and wonder if it might not be good for you." Genshirō related such matters. When Hachirōuemon heard this, [he said]: "Indeed, that is quite reasonable, and everyone's thoughts are perfectly sound. However, the time has not yet come. Certainly, even in Lord Aki-no-kami's thinking, this should not become a disturbance affecting the whole realm. I have heard that he thinks you should by all means hold back for now. Moreover, at this time Lord Kira's side is extremely vigilant, so if anything were to go wrong, what would become of it?"

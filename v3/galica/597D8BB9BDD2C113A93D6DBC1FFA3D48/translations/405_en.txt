■One　A verbal report delivered on the 15th by Lord Kira Sahyoe through his retainer Kasuya Heima as messenger to the monthly duty officer Lord Inaba Tango-no-kami:

Last night at the hour of the Monkey [around 3 AM], retainers of Asano Takumi-no-kami broke into my residence and killed my relative Kozuke-no-suke. I also participated in the fighting and sustained numerous deep wounds. Fourteen or fifteen of my retainers on duty were killed. Among the ruffians, some also sustained deep wounds, but since they withdrew in formation, no corpses were left behind. This being an urgent matter, I report this verbally.

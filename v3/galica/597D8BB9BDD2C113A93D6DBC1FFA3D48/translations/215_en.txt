Certificate

Item 1: On this occasion, silver totaling 13 kan 801 monme has been donated by the household retainers of Lord Asano Takumi-no-kami as funds for the graves of Lord Kagaku-in, Lord Kyūgaku-in, Lord Kageei-in, and Lord Reikō-in. With this silver, we have purchased rice fields measuring 5 tan 1 se 6 bu. We have received and hold seven field certificates along with one supplementary certificate. Regarding these fields, they shall be passed down to successive head priests according to the certificates. For matters concerning temple needs, not even a small portion of these fields shall be sold. Moreover, even for retirement purposes, these [fields] shall never be distributed to disciples, brothers, or lay relatives in perpetuity. Therefore, [we certify] as stated above.

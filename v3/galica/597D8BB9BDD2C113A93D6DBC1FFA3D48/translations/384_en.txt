Their crested garments varied in color, but their undergarments were largely similar. There were also some with peach-colored linings. All had freshly shaved foreheads (sakayaki), with hair either parted or washed with tea. All the hilts of their long and short swords were wrapped with braided Sanada cords around cut handles. Their head coverings were leather fire hoods on top, said to contain metal bowls inside, which were left discarded at the entrance. All of these items were collected and piled up. It was said that every single sword had been tempered with aloes wood (kyara) incense. Among the five wounded men, two appeared severely injured, with two or three foot soldier inspectors each tending to them. Their sitting posture was such that they had to lean against things or sit at an angle. When Lord Hoki-no-kami and three inspectors took their seats in the middle row, a foot soldier inspector came forward and reported, "The messengers sent by Lord Etchū-no-kami to receive them are waiting at the gate." Lord Hoki-no-kami ordered, "Have them come in." The receiving messengers consisted of one person in a haori jacket with a caretaker attendant, and two others dressed in hemp kamishimo formal wear.

○ Regarding Muramatsu Kihei 《marginal note: 20 koku | stipend for 5 men》: After the transfer of the mansion was completed, he was equally worried about the situation in Akō like everyone else. When heading to that place in late March, he explained his concerns to his son Sandayū, saying, "You are not someone who receives stipends from our lord, so please remain here to care for your elderly mother." Kihei was prepared to depart alone, but since the journey would be worrisome for an old man, Sandayū insisted "I absolutely must accompany you." They packed two sets of armor into one load and, taking turns riding, arrived about three ri before reaching Akō. There Kihei said, "Up to this point, the principle of filial piety has been maintained, but now I should return from here to care for my mother." Sandayū replied, "Since my younger brother Masaemon is with mother 【in red】《marginal note: at this time Masaemon was in service to Ogasawara Nagato-no-kami》there is no need for worry. Having come this far, should I really return? I earnestly wish to accompany you." So Kihei answered, "If that is the case, then I am satisfied."

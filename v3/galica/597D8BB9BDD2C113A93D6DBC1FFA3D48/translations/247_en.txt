I wish to make this request. I have heard that you have long been on familiar terms with Goji-in, so I would very much like you to discuss this matter favorably with him. Also, please discuss this thoroughly with Lord Nakagawa Jingobei, and have Teiryoin-sama and Danjō-sama make earnest requests to those with whom they have connections. Regarding this matter, I have no one else to turn to for help. First and foremost, I am making this request to you because your years of kind relations are known even to my retainers. Since this is a matter of such importance, though it may trouble you greatly, please resolve to undertake this task. The details will be explained by Hara Sōzaemon and Okamoto Jirōzaemon. I write this with utmost respect and humility.

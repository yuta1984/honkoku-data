We consider this most fortunate. Also, according to your intentions, we have understood and humbly acknowledge what you conveyed orally to Kyuzaemon and Jiuemon. When we informed all the retainers in detail, they understood and humbly accepted. We are gradually withdrawing from this place. Following your successive orders, we shall surrender the castle. While we have conveyed this acknowledgment to Lord Toda Gonzaemon, we still humbly request your kind intercession when you have the opportunity. With utmost respect and reverence.

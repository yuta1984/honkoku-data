All proceeded directly from Ōgaki in Mino Province to Akō
1. Lord Uneme-no-shō's messengers Toda Gonzaemon, Satomi Magodayū, Kano Jibu'emon,
　and Hatta Hikodayū arrived at Akō on the 6th day of the 4th month, however Jibu'emon and Hikodayū departed Edo on the 26th day of the 3rd month.
　The five men—Akō's chief retainer, steward, and inspector—gathered at Gonzaemon's town residence, where all were summoned and given instructions. Copy of the memorandum:
　　　"Regarding the dispatch of inspectors and those who will receive the castle to your domain this time, as previously communicated through messengers, you are to conduct all matters peacefully and with proper protocol for the castle's handover."
　　　This message was again conveyed from Lord Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami to Lord Uneme-no-shō's side, therefore

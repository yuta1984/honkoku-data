Oral Statement

Yesterday, the twenty-fifth day, through an official note from Lord Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami, it was conveyed to us that a few persons in charge of the transfer of Akō Castle and some local officials should remain, while all others should withdraw at their convenience. Each person should understand this intention. Therefore, we have written this on a separate paper - those designated in the written order should remain, while all others should withdraw quietly by the fifteenth day of the fourth month. The messenger will further explain this orally.

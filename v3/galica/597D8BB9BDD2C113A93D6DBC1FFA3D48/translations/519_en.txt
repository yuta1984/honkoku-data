One: According to Kuranosuke's account, they had previously agreed that if they broke in too late at night, they would naturally end up fighting among themselves, which would be unseemly.

One: A scribe of Lord Kōzuke-no-suke named [blank] heard the commotion and came out rubbing his sleepy face and turning his waist, whereupon he was cut down with a single blow. His wife, hearing the sound, rushed out and upon seeing this scene, took a short sword and long sword, had them thrust into the corpse, and left the sword drawn in his hand.

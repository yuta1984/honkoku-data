○ On March 10th, the court nobles were to arrive the following day, the 11th. The officials in charge of the rear escort, Tomimori Sukeuemon and Takada Gunbei, departed from their lodgings before dawn this morning and headed to Shinagawa.

○ On the same day, officials gradually moved to the Densō residence. From the same day, entry and exit through the back gate was stopped, and people of all ranks began using the front gate for entry and exit.

○ On the same day at the hour of the Horse, messengers came from both Densō, and there was an immediate audience with a formal meal served.

○ On the same day, after the evening meal had passed, at the latter part of the hour of the Sheep, there was a move to the Densō residence.

○ On March 11th, due to being somewhat indisposed, Terai Genkei [300 koku, stipend for 10 retainers] was summoned for medical care. Since being appointed to the role of Densō this time, he had exerted himself day and night, which aggravated his chronic condition of chest congestion. Due to this, he lost his composure in the palace and it led to the quarrel.

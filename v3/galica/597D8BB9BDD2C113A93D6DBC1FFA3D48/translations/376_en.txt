Among the foot soldier inspectors, those selected by lottery were ordered to go to Sengakuji Temple and escort [the men] there.

○One: Personnel were dispatched from the four custody locations after midday to take custody, but for some reason—what kind of consultation it was—they all withdrew. [Details are provided later]

○One: After half past eight, messengers from Lord Sengoku Hoki-no-kami—foot soldier inspectors Ishikawa Yaichirōemon, Nomura Shinpachi, and Matsunaga Kohachiró, along with ten minor inspectors—came and conveyed the following message to Ōishi Kuranosuke: Lord Hoki-no-kami said, "I have learned through the account of two men that you all conspired together and broke into Lord Kira Kozuke-no-suke's residence last night. However, there are further details I wish to hear, so please all come together to my residence immediately." A letter from these two men also arrived. Kuranosuke replied, "I humbly accept. We shall all come to pay our respects." The three foot soldier inspectors acknowledged this response in their reply.

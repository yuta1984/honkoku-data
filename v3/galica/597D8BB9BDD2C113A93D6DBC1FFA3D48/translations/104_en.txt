The detailed matters submitted through messengers this time have been communicated in writing.
　The above is a separate memorandum:
　　　"As previously communicated, the inspectors and those who will receive the castle will arrive at your domain after the middle of next month. You must ensure that all matters are conducted with proper protocol and without delay in the handover.
　　　This instruction to exercise even greater care has been conveyed from Lord Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami to us, therefore each of you must understand this intent and ensure that all retainers conduct themselves with proper restraint." A messenger has been dispatched for this purpose, and further details will be communicated orally.

Oral Statement

Regarding the matter of castle surrender, I sent a messenger the other day to convey this, so I trust you will understand the intent. Takumi (Takumi-no-kami) has long served the government faithfully, as you are all well aware. Regarding this incident, there is no helping what has happened, but it is essential that you quickly and properly withdraw from that place with all due ceremony, so please keep this in mind.

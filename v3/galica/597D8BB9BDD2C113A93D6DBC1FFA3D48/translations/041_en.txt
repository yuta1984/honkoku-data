○ First, on the 15th day of the 3rd month, his younger brother Lord Asano Daigaku was summoned to the Council of State (hyōjōsho), accompanied by Lord Toda Izu-no-kami, and the following was proclaimed:

Takumi(-no-kami) harbored resentment against Kira Kōzuke-no-suke and, without regard for the current circumstances, unreasonably attacked him with his sword within the palace. This act was deemed extremely insubordinate and inexcusable, and His Lordship ordered him to commit seppuku. Consequently, Daigaku is ordered into confinement. This was proclaimed in the presence of Senior Inspector Mizoguchi Settsu-no-kami-dono and Inspectors Kuru Jūzaemon-dono and Hanabusa Kan'emon-dono.

○ First, Lord Daigaku's residence was in Kobiki-chō 4th district.

○ Item: Itō Goemon (marginal note: head retainer) departed by boat for Miyoshi on the night of March 25th and arrived at Miyoshi at the hour of the boar (around 10 PM) on the night of the 27th. He was immediately summoned to the lord's residence for official business, then departed Miyoshi in the late morning hour of the rabbit and returned directly. The hosts who received him were Inada Yarokuzaemon and Isobe Sanai. The purpose was that since Lord Kira's life or death was unknown and no proper communication had come from Yasui Hikoemon and Fujii Matazaemon, the domain retainers were in turmoil. Both chief retainers requested that some means be devised to calm the situation.

○ Item: Copy of the letter given by Lord Tosa no Kami when Goemon returned
　　　I have understood the intentions of Kuranosuke's party and Kurōbei's thoughts regarding Lord Takumi no Kami's situation. However, ultimately, it would be proper to convey to everyone, down to the lowest ranks, that there should be no violation of the lord's will and no disturbances. I write this accordingly. With fear and respect.

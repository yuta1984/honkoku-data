Memorandum

1. My lodging is established in Hirama village, so from this location I can personally discuss all matters with the comrades.

1. For the attack, clothing should be black kosode. The obi knot should be on the right side, and care should be taken that the lower obi's front hanging portion does not come loose. Momohiki leg coverings, kyahan gaiters, and waraji sandals should be used.
　　Additionally, identification signs and passwords will be discussed later.

1. Generally speaking, each person should bring their specialty weapons as they see fit. Those among the group who should use spears, half-bows, etc. will be informed. This should be discussed and preparations arranged.

▢ One: A tailor named Chōemon who was in front of Lord Kōzuke-no-suke's mansion had been serving as an informant. Thinking it was a fire, he came with fire hooks and hatchets, but was struck down as he was mistaken for someone offering resistance.

▢ One: Lord Saheibe had minor hand wounds afterward. There was one shallow frontal wound and one diagonal slash wound about seven inches long that was somewhat deep. It is said that Kurihara Dōyū treated them.

▢ One: On Lord Kōzuke-no-suke's corpse, there were three wounds on both hands, one wound on the left thigh, two wounds on the kneecap, and one wound on the calf. Blood had dried and stuck to the short sword, and there were cuts in the handle. The sword was two shaku and three sun long, unsigned, with a scabbard that appeared to be made of deer hide. The short sword was not found. Sayūda Magobei, Iwase Toneri, and Saitō Kunaï - all three were present during the investigation and examination.

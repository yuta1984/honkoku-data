It was announced in the presence of the assembled Senior Councilors that the Takumi-no-kami (Asano) was appointed to receive the imperial envoys, and the Sakyō-no-suke (Date) was appointed to receive the Retired Emperor's envoys. They humbly accepted these appointments with reverence. Furthermore, regarding this occasion of entertaining the court nobles, it was deemed best to consult previous precedents and protocols, particularly consulting with the high-ranking families (kōke), especially Kira Kōzuke-no-suke (Junior Fourth Rank, Minor Captain, 4,000 koku, domain in Kira, Mikawa Province), to ensure everything proceeded smoothly. Since the matter of entertainment was of great importance, Lord Tajima-no-kami instructed that all arrangements should be made with careful attention to detail.

○ Regarding the appointment for this entertainment, messengers were sent to inform Kōzuke-no-suke and other high-ranking families. Concerning the protocols and precedents followed by those who had previously performed such duties, the deputy lords Tatebe Kihachi and Kondō Masaemon made inquiries and reported back. Additionally, Lord Tosa-no-kami sent Taniguchi Jihē, who lent them records of protocols from previous occasions, including even private memoranda. 7th day of the 2nd month.

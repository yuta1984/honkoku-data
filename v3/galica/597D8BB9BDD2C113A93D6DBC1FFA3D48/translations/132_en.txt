○ April 12th: Regarding the finalization of the castle surrender, while the acknowledgment to Lord Uneme-no-sho was conveyed through Toda Gonzaemon, an acknowledgment is still being sent to Edo as well.

I respectfully write this letter. Concerning the matter of surrendering this castle, Tanaka Gonzaemon, Tagawa Kyuzaemon, and Tsukioka Jiuemon brought the letter we received from Lord Uneme-no-sho, and additionally, the letter we subsequently received was delivered by Lord Toda Gonzaemon. We have respectfully received all of these. We gratefully acknowledge and understand the contents of what you have repeatedly taken care to convey to us.

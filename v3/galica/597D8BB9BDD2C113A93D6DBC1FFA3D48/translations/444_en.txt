Memorandum delivered to the retainers of Asano Takumi

Regarding the matter of Asano Takumi: He had been appointed to the duty of entertaining the imperial envoy, but due to his inexcusable misconduct in the palace during that time, punishment was ordered. The matter of Kira Kōzuke-no-suke, who received this punishment, was to be left alone without further interference. However, claiming to avenge their master's death, forty-six retainers of Takumi formed a band, broke into Kōzuke-no-suke's residence with weapons including projectile weapons, and killed Kōzuke-no-suke. This conduct shows repeated acts of insubordination and lack of fear toward the government. Therefore, [they are] ordered to commit seppuku.

In the end, we do not presume to know, but regarding the matter of your intervention, even if not directly, we would like to arrange in some way for favorable responses to be conveyed to the government officials, taking into consideration the lamentations of your house clan and making petitions on their behalf. Of course, those above would not be in a position to think favorably of this matter, but although it is not necessary to mention, the retainers do not consider Lord Daigaku's well-being and lament that if just one word were spoken to the members of your clan, matters could be resolved. Their attitude of resenting and suffering over Kuranosuke alone for not speaking up cannot be silenced, and they speak out about various matters without consideration.

1. Regarding the content of the above oral statement: after Lord Daigaku's house confinement, it is difficult to predict when he will be pardoned, and without any substantial standing or dignity, we believe it would be difficult to appear and perform duties.

"We too would like to be blessed by each of your noble aspirations," and everyone was pleased.

○One: The head priest said, "Though our temple prohibits alcohol, this morning is particularly cold, and since you are all in extraordinary circumstances, please partake of one cup of sake each." He personally took up the sake flask and earthenware cups, showing exceptional hospitality. However, Kuranosuke and the others replied, "Your profound kindness is immeasurable and we are deeply grateful. However, since this temple prohibits alcohol, it would go against our principles to drink sake here, so we should not partake." Though they declined repeatedly, the head priest insisted it would be no problem, so Kuranosuke said, "In that case, not accepting your goodwill would be rather discourteous," and each of them tilted large cups several times, enjoying themselves greatly. This was sake shared among warriors, bonds of trust between them.

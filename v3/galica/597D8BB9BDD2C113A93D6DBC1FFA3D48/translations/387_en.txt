"Was it dark?" they were asked. Both men answered: "Last night was a clear moonlit night with strong light, so we had no difficulties at all." "Did you arrange passwords for the night attack?" Both men answered: "Indeed, we did arrange them." "What was used as the identifying sign?" they were asked. They replied: "We used white cloth." "How did you enter the residence?" they were asked. Both men answered: "We broke through the gate." "How did you manage lighting inside the residence?" Both men answered: "When we rushed in, we captured one of their guards and held him in a bear hug. We asked this person where the candles were kept, took out the container, counted them, lit the candles with the lamp at the entrance, and rushed into the residence. We searched everywhere, including the bathhouse and even under the verandas, but Lord Kōzuke-no-suke was nowhere to be seen." When they said this, they were asked: "Did you go to his living quarters?" Both men answered: "We certainly went to what we believed to be his living quarters. In the adjoining room, there were many items that appeared to be guards' bedding scattered about. During this time, a man called Majūjirō went to the charcoal storage room, and when he broke open the door, there were sounds of a person inside."

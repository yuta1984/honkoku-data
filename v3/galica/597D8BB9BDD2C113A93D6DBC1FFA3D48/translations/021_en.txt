In his place, Lord Wakisaka Awaji-no-kami was appointed.

○ Regarding the preliminary arrangements for the entertainment, when inquiries were made to Kōzuke-no-suke-dono, there were many improper behaviors on his part. Since Kōzuke-no-suke-dono was inherently a greedy person, those who had previously performed such duties had frequently offered gifts and presents in advance. Kihachi and Masaemon sent messages even to the chamberlains, and the chamberlains also reported this matter repeatedly. However, Lord Takumi-no-kami's intention was that while he would gladly offer any amount of gifts after the duties were completed, he thought it improper to frequently give presents beforehand. The formal protocol documents were sent in advance as proper.

○ Due to Kōzuke-no-suke-dono's various improper behaviors mentioned above, it is widely heard that Lord Takumi-no-kami harbored much resentment and frustration.

When called upon saying "Hara Sōemon must have seen and known him during last year's imperial messenger proceedings," Sōemon came forward, and upon just one glance, laughed heartily saying "Ah, how joyful! This is indeed Lord Kōzuke-no-suke!" "Indeed, Lord Kira always used to say 'If night attackers should enter, it would be sad to fight against the young lords and be cut down. Also, as an old man, it would be regrettable to flee. In any case, I should hide in a good place.'" He had indeed hidden himself. However, being covered in blood, even his head could not be clearly distinguished, so please wash it and have a look." No sooner had he said this than he took the head, left the room, approached the nearby washbasin, stroked the white-haired face, and washed the head with water where ice had melted. Ah, as the blood flowed away, it appeared to be the original Kōzuke-no-suke. Truly, cowards who disgrace their names must all be like this.

Regarding the content of the letter, while it is understandable that all the retainers of your household are single-mindedly devoted to their lord, I believe this is entirely due to their unfamiliarity with the local circumstances. As I previously instructed the two aforementioned envoys, honoring the Shogunate and promptly surrendering the castle without delay, then withdrawing quickly, would align with Lord Takumi's long-held intentions and would fulfill his true wishes. Therefore, please be aware of this matter once again. I write thus to convey this message.

Kuranosuke took his wife and children to Toyooka in Tajima Province and went to the home of his father-in-law, Ishizuka Gengobyōe. He formally severed ties with his wife and second son, entrusting them to Gengobyōe, while having his son Chikara undergo the coming-of-age ceremony. The father and son then left Toyooka for Edo. After observing the situation there, they proceeded to Kyoto, where they became townspeople and deliberately displayed dissolute behavior that was beyond description. Now, regarding the efforts to ingratiate themselves with the retainers in charge of Lord Uesugi Danjō's treasury residence and Kyoto residence - this situation was indescribable in its complexity. Kuranosuke, claiming illness, went to scenic spots and pleasure quarters for diversion, and would seclude himself for five to seven days at a time, feigning sickness. The mansion guards understood these circumstances, and as they became familiar with each other, their true intentions became apparent. Moreover, since most of Lord Takumi-no-kami's retainers in Kyoto were men without ambition, there was no particular cause for concern about their reliability. Therefore, although Lord Danjō had secret agents gathering intelligence, it appeared that he was not overly concerned about the situation.

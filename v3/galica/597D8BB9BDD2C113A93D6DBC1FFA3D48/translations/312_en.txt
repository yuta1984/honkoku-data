1. Those who deserted were: Nakamura Seiuemon, Suzuta Jūhachi (page, thirty koku stipend, support for three people), Tanaka Sadashirō, Nakata Riheiji (one hundred koku, mounted retainer), Oyamada Shōzaemon (Edo native, one hundred koku, mounted retainer), Shiota Magozaemon (retainer of Ōishi Kuranosuke), and Yano Isuke (foot soldier, support for five people).

1. Terasaka Kichiuemon Nobuyuki (five koku, support for two people), a foot soldier of Yoshida Chūzaemon, was included among the forty-seven and accompanied them. He remained there until everyone broke into the mansion, but after that he was not seen. Since the haori jackets and such that everyone had been wearing were left discarded outside the gate, it appeared that he stole these and returned home.

Regarding this Terasaka Kichiuemon, according to later accounts by Yoshida Chūzaemon's wife and children, he received written permission from Kuranosuke stating it would be acceptable for him to leave the scene. Since Chūzaemon's wife and children were in Himeji in Harima Province, the castle town of Lord Honda Nakatsukasa-tayū, he returned there to look after them and has been living there. Due to the lord's transfer of domains, they moved together to Echigo Murakami, and according to the account, he still resides in that place to this day.

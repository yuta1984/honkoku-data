If there were things they wished to have conveyed, he would comply with any request. When told to speak in detail to the retainer, Kuranosuke said, "The great kindness shown over these many days will not be forgotten even after death. I humbly request your favorable intercession." Since we humble servants had resolved that the night of our attack would be our death, what could we possibly have left to think about? However, if anyone had thoughts to express, there would be no difficulty—they should quickly comply with your wishes. The remaining group all said unanimously that they had nothing else to add beyond what Kuranosuke had stated.

○One: When the proclamation was made at Lord Hosokawa Echizen no Kami's residence, the seating arrangement had the metsuke (inspectors) in the upper seats, followed by the tsukaiban (messengers), facing them were Lord Echizen no Kami's ashigaru metsuke (foot soldier inspectors), and down to Lord Echizen no Kami's karō and yōnin (senior retainers and administrators) in graduated seating. Then Kuranosuke was summoned to a separate room, while the remaining men sat in a row separated by the threshold. Lord Jūzaemon made the proclamation, and everyone arose.

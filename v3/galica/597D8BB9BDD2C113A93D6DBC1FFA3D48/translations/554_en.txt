Seeing it brings satisfaction, this revenge; Four - when dawn breaks, Uesugi knows nothing; Five - how long will you
live in shame? Six - forcibly claiming illness; Seven - weeping,
Saemon escapes; Eight - useless retainers; Nine - here and there
becoming a laughingstock; Ten - in any case, Danjō

One: Lord Kōzuke-no-suke's death poem
　　Compared to the heart's pain after being killed,
　　　　The old wounds did not hurt at all

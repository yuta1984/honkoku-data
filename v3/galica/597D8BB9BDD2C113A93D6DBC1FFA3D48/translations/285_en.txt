"However, this is not a strict confinement, so please understand this matter accordingly," he was told.
Kichidayū acknowledged this, consulted with the senior retainers on various matters, returned, and reported this to Lord Aki-no-kami.
The officials discussed among themselves and immediately began preparations at the Mukai residence in Sakurada.

○On the same day, Lord Daigaku was summoned to Lord Katō Etchū-no-kami's residence (the Council of State) accompanied by Lord Asano Saheiji, where he was told: "Your confinement has been pardoned, so you should return to Lord Aki-no-kami with your wife and children. You should depart immediately." He immediately went to the Mukai residence accompanied by Lord Saheiji.
It was decided that "Lord Aki-no-kami should return to his home domain. This matter has been communicated to Lord Aki-no-kami from the Senior Councillors."

○As for his wife and children, they moved to the Mukai residence that same evening, with about half of the senior retainers accompanying them.

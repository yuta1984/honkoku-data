▢ Item: Yoshida Chūzaemon said, "The leaders of this night attack are Kuranosuke and myself,
　　so I shall commit seppuku first before everyone else. Kuranosuke-dono should witness everyone's final moments
　　and follow afterwards." Kuranosuke replied, "As you wish, please go first.
　　I will follow behind." Since Chūzaemon was advanced in years, his breathing was labored,
　　and he thrust his sword two or three times into his thigh, then called for his second.
　　　　　　　　　　　　【This sequence is suspicious】
▢ Item: For the first two or three men, they performed the ritual properly by cutting their bellies, and when they called out, the seconds beheaded them. However, from the fourth or fifth person onward, they were struck down while raising their short swords overhead, so Kuranosuke said, "Everyone wishes to perform this in the proper manner. Please allow them to cut their bellies fully before performing kaishakunin." Mase

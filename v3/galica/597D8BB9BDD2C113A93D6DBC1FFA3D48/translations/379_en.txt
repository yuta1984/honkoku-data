That intention was conveyed, and immediately personnel were sent to Sengakuji Temple with the caretakers Miura Shichiro-bei and Matsuura Sakuzaemon.

Two middle elders, two commanders (monogashira), two senior inspectors
Ten stipend recipients, four foot soldier inspectors, four junior inspectors
Two hundred foot soldiers, one hundred servants, ten palanquins
Twenty tall hanging lanterns, twenty box hanging lanterns {{Note: This number of personnel is uncertain. Among them, twenty lanterns each certainly did not go to Sengakuji Temple - perhaps they went to Lord Sengoku's residence}}

The caretaker led this number of personnel to Shiba Sengakuji Temple, whereupon after seven o'clock, a joint letter from Lord Hoki-no-kami, Lord Gengoro-emon, and Lord Gozaemon arrived at Lord Oki-no-kami's upper residence.

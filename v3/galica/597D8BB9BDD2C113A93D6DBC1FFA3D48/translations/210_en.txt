○1. Copy of the written report from Inoue Dan'emon to Miyoshi:
Regarding Dan'emon's matter, immediately after the castle surrender was completed, he went to see both inspectors (metsuke), whereupon Lord Araki Juzaemon said, "The castle has been successfully handed over, which I find most commendable. You have all worked hard during this period." In response to this statement, [Dan'emon replied] "I humbly ask your pardon for this presumptuous inquiry, but how do you view the matter of the surrender arrangements here this time?"

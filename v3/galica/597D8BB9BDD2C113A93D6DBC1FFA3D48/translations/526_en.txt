can be together with such resolve. Please take me along wherever you go." Kuranosuke replied: "Even women are not incapable of having such determination. I understand that point. However, if I were to say I am taking a woman along, it would first and foremost not be proper for Lord Takumi-no-kami's sake. As for my second son, he is young, and moreover has not yet had an audience with his lord, so I will not take him. Whether he becomes a monk or not is up to his own decision. After the severance of family ties, I do not interfere. As for Chikara, he is the eldest son, has had an audience with our deceased lord, and has received appropriate favors, so I will take him with me. At that time I still had my forelocks, so when I asked what should be done about this, he washed my hair in the water basin of the sitting room, and Kuranosuke himself performed my coming-of-age ceremony. My mother also understood this reasoning, and in such circumstances, it is customary to share sake cups as a farewell."

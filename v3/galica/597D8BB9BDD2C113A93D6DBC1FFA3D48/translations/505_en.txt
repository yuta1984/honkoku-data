Since I am hastening single-mindedly on this final journey, my heart is somehow restless, and this has resulted in such a brief letter. Though this comes at the end of my writing, I humbly request that you properly inform your wife of our situation. I earnestly entreat you to take good care of the families and relatives at our lodgings. I have roughly written down this letter for your perusal. Please read it through.

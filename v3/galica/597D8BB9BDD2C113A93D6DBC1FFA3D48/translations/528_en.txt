He shed tears, he said. His words were sincere and his manner was truly admirable. There was no one who heard this who did not shed tears themselves.

At Lord Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami's residence, on the morning of the second day of the second month in the year of the Sheep, everyone was summoned and served a meal in the reception room. During the audience, the lord said, "I have not been able to offer you proper hospitality during this time. This morning I have ordered that you be entertained." A senior retainer approached and respectfully said, "Our lord has given various instructions, so we have prepared crane for you. Please take your time and enjoy it." Kuranosuke accepted this, saying, "We have been receiving your hospitality for a long time, and we are most grateful for your kind words just now. Among our group, there may be some who have never eaten crane before, so we will take our time to partake of it." He expressed that this was a particularly gracious gesture. Afterward, he said to everyone, "It seems our final moment is drawing near," speaking these words in secret.

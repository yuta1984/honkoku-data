[The matter] was communicated by letter.

○ First, since Lord Ukyō-dayū stated that the corpse would be handed over at the latter part of the Hour of the Monkey (around 4 PM), the following people went to receive it:
Kasuya Kanzaemon (retainer, 250 koku), Kataoka Gengorōemon, Tanaka Teishirō (attendant clerk, 150 koku), Isogai Jūrōzaemon (same rank), Nakamura Seiemon, Tatebe Kiroku [text below crossed out]

In addition to these, from foot soldiers down to the lowest ranks, all went to Lord Ukyō-dayū's residence at evening time. There, with the household retainers present, they were called onto the veranda of the study hall, and after various greetings were exchanged, they were guided to the garden where the seppuku had taken place.

There, folding screens had been set up all around, and many samurai were in attendance nearby. The head had been placed by the left shoulder of the corpse. They received it, placed it in the palanquin, and put it in the coffin. The formal crested garment and the two swords were received at Lord Ukyō-dayū's residence. The short sword from the time of the assault, the tissue paper pouch, the tabi socks, and the fan were also [received] according to protocol.

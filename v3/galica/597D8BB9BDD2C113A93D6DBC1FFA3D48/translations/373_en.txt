Sauda Magobei and the messenger monk from Banshōin received the head.

In a postscript: Kōzuke-no-suke's head was kept at Sengakuji until the 16th, and when the temple inquired with the magistrate of temples and shrines, they were instructed to send it to Kōzuke-no-suke's family temple. However, when Sengakuji replied that it might be questionable to send it from the family temple back to Lord Kōzuke-no-suke's residence, they were told that since this was a matter with no official interference from above, they could handle it as they saw fit. Therefore, on the night of the 16th, it was sent from Sengakuji to Lord Saheiji accompanied by two monks.

○One: When the head priest served gruel, everyone partook of it, saying with laughter, "We never expected to be like bones in the earth, yet we are blessed to receive your memorial service."

○One: When Horibe Yahei received the gruel, he said to the head priest, "We are all men who will commit seppuku, so we would like to request your spiritual guidance." The priest replied, "That is precisely what we monks constantly aspire to as our primary aim - your present state of mind is itself spiritual practice. Each of you embodies the principle of 'immediate mind, immediate Buddha.'"

Peacefully through the ten thousand generations you shall live,
The green turtle too shall meet with you - Nōyō (Jō)

The turtle dwelling in the tranquil waters of the imperial pond
Compared to you, shall also live ten thousand generations - Kōkichi (Jō)

Unchangingly, pledge the turtle as your friend,
For your lifespan extends through eight hundred myriad generations - Furun (Jō)

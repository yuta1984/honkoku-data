For ten thousand generations of lifespan beyond eighty years
The enduring promise made with the turtle of the sacred pond

The turtle that dwells familiarly in this lord's pond
Is the ageless friend of your ten thousand generations

For ten thousand generations of lifespan beyond counting
Having made a pact with the turtle, they seem to pass time together

For a thousand years, ten thousand years, the turtle also waits as a friend of longevity,
Floating and playing in waves that never age　Senpū

This garden as Hōrai Island for ten thousand years,
The accompanying turtle has grown accustomed and dwells here　Kisai

The dwelling turtle, like a mirror of the pool without cloudiness,
Reflects and becomes your friend for ten thousand generations　Shinjun

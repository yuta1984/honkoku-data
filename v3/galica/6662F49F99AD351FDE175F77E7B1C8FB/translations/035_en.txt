From today onward, making the turtle a friend without barriers,
Your lifespan shall extend through ten thousand generations　Mori'i

The turtle that has dwelt for many years in this pond—
Becoming familiar with it as a friend, may we prosper for ten thousand ages　Shindō

The heart of the pond where the turtle dwells, waves of old age
Come rushing to befriend us for a thousand years, ten thousand generations　Shigetō

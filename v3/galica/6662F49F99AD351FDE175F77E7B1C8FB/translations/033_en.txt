Following the auspicious example of pulling a turtle's tail, may the waves of old age
Continue for ten thousand generations, even after crossing eighty rapids　Masanari

Taking the auspicious example of the turtle's long tail as a companion,
Shall we compare and pull together your ten thousand generations?　Yoshitomo

Even the turtle that dwells in the honorable pond waters, grown familiar,
Will spend ten thousand generations as your friend　Masayuki

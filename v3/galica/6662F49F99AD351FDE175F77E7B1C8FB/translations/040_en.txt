This small turtle playing in the noble pond as a friend
Must surely long for and rely upon your lordship's ten thousand years　Morichi

The turtle that dwells occupying the immovable rock foundation
Is your friend for a thousand and ten thousand generations　Rokutoku

O lord who would live through the turtle's lifespan
As a friend who adds joy eternally　Jishun

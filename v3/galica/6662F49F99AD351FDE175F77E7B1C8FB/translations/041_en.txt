As you are a lord who prospers in health at eighty years,
Your lifespan shall still be equal to that of a turtle　Shinkin

The river turtle that plays in the eighty rapids of the hundred-less
Is a friend of ten thousand generations who accompanies you　Han'yō

As an endless friend in the pond water of the garden,
The turtle shall dwell for ten thousand generations　Jōki

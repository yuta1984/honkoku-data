Who but you, my lord, could count the accumulating years
Of the green turtle's long lifespan - Kyuju

Playing together with a pledge of ten thousand generations, you should witness
The accumulating count of the turtle's tail segments - Kōchō

The turtle dwelling at the shore of the imperial garden's pond
Is a friend for the ten thousand generations you shall live through - Shinnari

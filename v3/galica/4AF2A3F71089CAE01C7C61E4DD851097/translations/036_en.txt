[Forces] had assembled and were about to fight against Russia. In 1812 (the 10th year of Bunka in our country, the year of Mizunoto-tori), on May 9th of that year, Napoleon departed from St. Petersburg, and on June 25th his forces crossed the "Niemen" River, advancing their troops to Moscow, the former capital of Russia, on September 15th. At this time, the Russians themselves set fires in 500 locations and burned the city. The wind was fierce and the fire was intense, with flames and smoke that did not subside for seven days. Due to this, Napoleon's entire army suffered a great defeat, and although he wished to station his exhausted troops in Moscow to survive the winter and await the coming of spring, since the city had been completely burned to ashes, there was no place to rest his soldiers and horses, and he found himself in a desperately constrained situation with no way forward or back.

"Overseas Turmoil and Order" Illustrated Biographical Sketches, Volume 2
Chapter 2

Now then, Bonaparte (Napoleon) left the Italian camp, appointed Masséna as general to replace him, and returned to Paris on July 1st of the year 1800 (Note: the first year of Kyōwa in our country, the year of Kanoto-tori). Among the people of Paris Prefecture, some rejoiced at his return, while others despised his arrogance and his ambition to seize the country, which grew stronger day by day, and desired to harm him. In October, those who sought to cause rebellion were captured and imprisoned. In December, they attempted to assassinate Bonaparte (Napoleon) by exploding a cannon.

[Note: The first year of Kyōwa in our country corresponds to 1801, so there is a one-year discrepancy. Hereafter, the Western and Japanese calendars continue to be recorded with this discrepancy.]

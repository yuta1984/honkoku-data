conspired to kill him and cause a rebellion, and this matter was exposed. The ringleaders were "Pichegru" and "Georges." The remaining forty-three rebels were all captured one after another. "Moreau" was also among their number and was taken alive. Furthermore, there were those who reported that this rebel party conspired to coordinate internally and externally by secretly corresponding with French people who had fled to foreign countries and with "Achten," an English envoy residing in Germany. Thereupon, he immediately ordered "Caulaincourt" to command two battalions of soldiers, and on the night of March 15th, concealing his troops, crossed the Rhine River, taking advantage of their unpreparedness, advanced into "Baden" territory, and surrounded "Kehl" and "Ettenheim."

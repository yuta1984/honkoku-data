This was a scheme to drive them into submission. Napoleon had already annexed various countries and his military power grew stronger day by day. Riding on this momentum, he desired to further annex neighboring countries to expand French territory. In 1808 (the 6th year of Bunka, year of Tsuchinoto-mi in our country), on January 1st of that year, seeing that neighboring countries were now submissive to him, he seized Geldern, Castel, Wesel, and Vlissingen and annexed them to France. At this time, there was civil war in Spain, with factions dividing and attacking each other. The French Emperor took advantage of this and finally seized that country, transferring his brother Joseph, who had been King of Naples, to be crowned King of Spain, and moving his brother-in-law Murat to become king in Naples.

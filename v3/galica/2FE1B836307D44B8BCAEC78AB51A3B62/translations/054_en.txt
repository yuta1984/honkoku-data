King Murat of Naples, being Napoleon's brother-in-law, immediately conceived a scheme to seek profit greedily, and intending to plunder the Italian territories, he led 80,000 troops under his command and suddenly invaded the territories belonging to Rome and Tuscany. He incited the local people, promising that those who sided with him would be freed from national laws and gain the glory of liberty. By the 3rd of the fourth month, he had already reached the vicinity of Bologna. Now, as the force to suppress this army, the Austrian general Johann Bianchi led his troops against them in battle.

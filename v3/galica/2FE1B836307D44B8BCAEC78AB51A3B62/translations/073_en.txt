arrived, and from here he wished to go to America. He prepared a large frigate ship and boarded it, waiting for favorable winds, when British patrol warships spotted him and would not let him escape. Particularly since it was a moonlit night, Bonaparte could not escape under cover of darkness, and on the fifteenth day he finally boarded a small boat himself, accompanied by about forty people including Bertrand, Savary, and Lamalmaison, and surrendered himself to the British. He was transferred to the ship Bellerophon. The British captured them and arrived at Torbay (a place name in Britain) on the twenty-fourth day.

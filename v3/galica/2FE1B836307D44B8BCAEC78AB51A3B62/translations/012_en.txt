Karl Johan 《Note: Johan is an abbreviation of Johannes; since he was adopted, this is his restored surname》. Truly, Bonaparte's use of military force is godlike, surpassing everyone's expectations, something unheard of since ancient times. He has already swallowed up one-third of Europe and calls himself Emperor. He made his elder brother Joseph Napoleon king of Spain, his younger brother Louis Napoleon king of Holland, his brother-in-law Joachim Murat king of the Two Sicilies and Naples, and made his own son the Crown Prince of Rome.

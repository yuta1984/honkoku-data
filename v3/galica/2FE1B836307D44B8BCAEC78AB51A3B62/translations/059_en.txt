[The royalists] wanted to use the people of the southern region to defend against Bonaparte, but because his power was strong, they avoided [confrontation] and retreated by ship to Cette. Thus Bonaparte himself gathered his troops at the field of Mai for inspection, [finding] eighteen thousand. About twenty thousand had already been dispatched to various places, but since there remained forty to fifty thousand well-trained strong soldiers, on the twelfth day of the sixth month, he led all his army toward the Dutch border, intending to fight against the Prussian and Austrian armies stationed there, and arrived at that place on the fourteenth day.

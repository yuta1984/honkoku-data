Previously, when the Dutch king was defeated by Bonaparte and was in England with the heir, the English king had one daughter but no son, so they intended to adopt that heir as successor and marry him to their daughter (note: about 180 years ago).

(Note: Willem II of the Netherlands married the eldest daughter of Charles I of England and sired Willem III. The third also married a daughter of James II of England. At this time England lacked heirs, and perhaps because Willem III was a grandson through the female line, he eventually became King of England and ruled both the Netherlands and England concurrently)

Afterwards, because Bonaparte's brother became King of the Netherlands (note: his name was Louis Napoleon), the Dutch heir could not obtain the country, the people would not submit, and he finally fled.

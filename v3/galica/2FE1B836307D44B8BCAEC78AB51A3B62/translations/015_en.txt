When he fled in defeat and reached Poland, the Swedish King Alexander (note: formerly a general under Bonaparte) was waiting in ambush to attack. Not only that, but the military forces of Poland and Saxony (note: country name) betrayed him, so although Bonaparte was brave, with enemies on all sides - front, back, left and right - it was difficult to respond, and he fled in defeat again, returning to France. At that time his forces numbered no more than fifty thousand (note: this event was probably in the winter of Bunka 11). Initially, the Dutch ruler Willem V married a daughter of the Prussian King and sired the heir Prince van Oranje (note: the current King of the Netherlands. Prince van Oranje is the title of the heir apparent).

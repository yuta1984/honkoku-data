hoping to marry her to a good son-in-law, when fortunately an acquaintance offered to serve as matchmaker, they welcomed him and made him Asaka's husband. They intended this to provide security in their old age, but this son-in-law was a man of poor character who treated not only Asaka and her child badly, but was also harsh toward her parents, being cruel and dissolute. Realizing that things could not continue peacefully this way, and that while his eyes were still black (while he was still alive), everything should be under his control, the father arranged to divorce this son-in-law. Since Asaka had never particularly cared for this husband anyway, she ultimately felt fortunate about this. From then on, she lived as a widow, and as days and nights passed, her parents gradually passed away. Now it was just the mother and child in their humble dwelling, as described in the first volume.

Therefore, the reason Otose's appearance and manner seem superior to others must be due to her parentage.

Chapter Six: The Volume of Deception

The tender young peaks appear beautiful, like young grass whose binding threads of fate begin to form. Since this morning the rain has lessened, and as the sound of jewel-like water flowing around the eaves echoes in his sleeping ears, Lord Yoshimitsu awakens. Looking about, he sees that Asaka, who had lain beside him until dawn, is not there. Though it's raining, is the day already advanced? The rain shutters and folding screens are closed up, making his immediate surroundings quite dark, yet the lattice windows shine brilliantly. Thinking he had overslept due to last night's exertions, he sits up and claps his hands softly.

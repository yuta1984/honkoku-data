It was the usual unchanging comparison, but her skin's texture was beyond words to describe. Yoshimitsu could no longer contain himself and thought of pushing her down right there, but that would not only be quite improper behavior, but if they took time, people might come, so even this could not go as he wished. Moreover, sensing Otose's anxiety as she said fearfully, "Oh, someone seems to be coming - I hear footsteps," he released his hand and said, "Then I'll come to you tonight, so wait for me with that in mind." She only said "Yes," covering her mouth with her sleeve and smiling happily. Yoshimitsu then went into the privy and before long returned to his original seat. With various more playful exchanges, that day too gradually came to an end, and as everyone became intoxicated and it was past the hour of the Dog (after 8 PM), it would be good to rest now. Asaka had planned from before to enjoy herself fully with Yoshimitsu that night as well, so she instructed the maidservants to place her sleeping quarters two rooms away from Otose's, and to prepare Yoshimitsu's sleeping area in the upper room above her own, while having beds laid out for everyone else in their respective rooms. Soon, beginning with the master, everyone retired to their bedrooms. Otose, her maiden's heart confused by Yoshimitsu's beauty, remembered he had said he would secretly visit tonight - if he truly meant it, might he be waiting for everyone to fall asleep? With such thoughts, she too could not sleep, deliberately dimming her lamp, her heart unsettled.

where it was pushed back by the woman's love juices and mixed together within her womb, the yin and yang mingling intensely like battling waters, creating such indescribable pleasure that they felt as though their lives might end there, their eyes unable to see and ears unable to hear.

Now Yoshimitsu observed his surroundings and, deciding the time was right, emerged and went to Otose's bedroom, which he had long had his eye on. Standing outside and listening, he peered at the situation within and heard sounds of someone moving about, still not asleep, with small coughs here and there. "Surely this must be the place," he thought, and gently slid open the shoji screen. The lamplight flickered dimly, nearly extinguished, and a folding screen was arranged in a circle around where someone lay within.

Yoshimitsu quietly placed his hand on the screen and pulled it aside. Otose realized what was happening and sat up straight. Though joy overflowed in her body, her heart, still unaccustomed to love, had no words to speak, and she sat looking downward in a manner that was far more charming than if she had spoken hastily about this or that.

Yoshimitsu drew close to her and said, "I thought you would probably be waiting, and I wanted to come earlier, but it seemed everyone was still awake. Others aside, there were some complications with Asaka, so I waited for her to sleep soundly, which made me late. You must have found the wait interminable. However, in exchange for making you wait so long, I won't let you sleep until dawn."

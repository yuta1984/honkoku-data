Though the novelty of things may have withered somewhat with age, her mannerisms and speech were neither vulgar nor boorish. With the inner calculation of having just a taste of Asaka, he settled in for a grand banquet, planning to stay the night. Spring nights pass all too quickly, and it was already approaching the hour of nine (around midnight). Asaka was worrying in her heart about her daughter who had not returned.

After all, the reason this nobleman had come to such a humble grass hut was for her daughter Otose, and if she didn't return tonight either, he would surely be displeased. With this worry, the sake he drank didn't settle well in his stomach, and he couldn't drink pleasantly. All his secretive attentions seemed to be in vain as the night grew late.

Asaka instructed a servant girl to bring out the finest bedding available, and consulting with Saguri, said "Though this place is dirty and uncomfortable, please rest on this bed," and spread it out in the front parlor. An silk brocade futon with damask side coverings. "Please rest here," she said, while in the storage room separated by one interval, Saguri's bed was laid out.

Yoshimitsu-kimi entered the front parlor under Asaka's guidance, rested his head on his elbow atop the futon, and lay down while intoxicated. Asaka knelt beside him with her hands properly placed.

Asaka: "My lord, if you remain dressed like that, your clothing will wrinkle and look unseemly. Please, please change into this. I could massage your lower back or feet if you wish."

At this, Yoshimitsu sat up, grabbed Asaka's hand firmly, and said:

Yoshimitsu: "There's no need to massage anywhere else - just stroke this," as he guided her hand to place it there.

When he claps his hands to call, someone responds "Yes" and quietly opens the folding screen to enter - it is Asaka. Her disheveled hair from sleep has already been arranged, light makeup applied, and rouge and tooth-blackening are appropriately done. Ah, what a pity - if this woman were ten years younger, she would be a beauty without equal. Her appearance is so captivating that one cannot help but stare. Placing her hands on the floor and bowing her head:

Asaka: "Have you awakened? Today is unfortunately a heavy rain, so it would be quite difficult for you to return to your mansion. Lord Saguri also said as much, so I have been staying quietly."

Yoshimitsu: "Is that so? Indeed it is pouring. But Asaka, you got up quite early. I was apparently very tired, and after that I knew nothing at all until I just now awakened."

Asaka: "Ho ho ho, thanks to you, my body has become completely limp, as if my sinews and bones had been drawn out. But while this was happening, I heard the crows calling, and thinking that if Lord Saguri discovered us it might bring shame upon you, I got up and went to the storage room. But my head was spinning and reeling with dizziness. The times when I had to endure this and try not to let it show in my behavior - how painful that must have been!"

Yoshimitsu: "Well then, don't you want to go through that painful experience once more?"

Asaka: "Yes, that would be quite fine. Ho ho ho, you must despise me as a lustful woman."

Yoshimitsu: "You must be quite thoroughly chastened by now."

Asaka: "No, I am not chastened at all."

Yoshimitsu: "If you're not chastened, then let's have a morning drink here. Come now," and as he takes her hand, Asaka smiles broadly.

Because he was a descendant [of Shinra Saburo], he took the name Takeda, and later changed it to adopt the place name of his homeland, Kakizaki. Subsequently, a person from Wakasa Province came to the island (Ezo) and became a dependent of the Kakizaki family. He had relations with a daughter of the family and eventually became a son-in-law, establishing a separate household. In the generation of his descendants, they moved to Matsumae and became chieftains by subduing the Ainu.

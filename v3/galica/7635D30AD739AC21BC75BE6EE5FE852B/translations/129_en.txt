[The Ainu] told the chiefs of Kunashiri Island and Akkeshi that the Russians greatly resented their taking and dividing the goods that were on the ship. They plotted that treasures should be offered to appease this resentment, and [the Russians] desired to seize these. Because their private greed became apparent, the chiefs say that this year they will capture Haushibi and subject him to punishment according to local custom.

Furthermore, [the document] asks: In Meiwa 8, year of the Metal Rabbit (Russian year 1771), a person from that country named Hambengoro drifted to the southern seas of Japan and received protection from the lord of Awa Province.

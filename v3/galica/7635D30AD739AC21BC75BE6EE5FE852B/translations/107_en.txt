Tarakhan Eriskoi (Great Tartary)

What the red people (Russians) call Manzouria refers to Great Tartary's subjugation to the Great Tang (China). The Ainu and Santan people are called Mandju, as we have heard.

Ohotskoi (Located thirty-some degrees east of Irkutskoi. From Ohotskoi via Kamchatka to the Ainu island of Uruppu, the sea route with favorable winds takes approximately ten days. Moreover, Ohotskoi is originally different from Ainu territory. It is a land where people have been civilized. Because they most quickly submitted to Russia and returned to virtue, the country prospers. It is said that there are now over thirty officials equivalent to prefects and district governors.)

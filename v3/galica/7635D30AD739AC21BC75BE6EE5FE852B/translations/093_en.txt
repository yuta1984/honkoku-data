A large force arrived. The Ainu saw this and were greatly frightened, becoming confused and panicked. Without waiting for favorable winds, they launched their boats and fled back home. At that moment, contrary winds arose and more than ten vessels were smashed all at once, with over a hundred people drowning. After setting out to sea, some had no choice but to remain on Urup Island.

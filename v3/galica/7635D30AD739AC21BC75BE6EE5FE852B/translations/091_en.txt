When they moored their ship and came ashore, [the Ainu] immediately surrounded and attacked them. More than ten people died instantly, while the rest all fled and boarded their ship. Although it is said that four or five Ainu also died from being hit by the red people's (Russians') firearms, they still pressed their advantage and continued the attack. Even when they reached the ship, two or three more died from being struck by poisoned arrows.

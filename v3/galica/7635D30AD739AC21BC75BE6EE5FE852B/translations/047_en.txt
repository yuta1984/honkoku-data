Efuriko: This plant has not yet been studied in detail. The people of Matsumae use it as medicine. Its form has characteristics similar to mulberry fruit. Its taste is sweet.

It is the same as the substance called "telemen" that the Ainu people brought.

Although it is said that there are many wild grasses and trees besides those mentioned above, since they do not differ from the plants of the main provinces and their Ainu names are not well known, I will omit them.

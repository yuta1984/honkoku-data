Though common people despise and laugh at them saying they know no proper customs, when examined closely, they calculate years by heat and cold, measure the last and first days of months, observe seasonal conditions to know the four seasons and eight seasonal divisions, and each household has monthly festivals. (For monthly festivals, they make rings of miscanthus grass like those used in Nagoshi purification rituals, call them "Kamui-shika-natsuke," add offerings and erect them by the seashore for purification. They call purification prayers "itaku.") The great festival of the year generally takes place around the winter solstice.

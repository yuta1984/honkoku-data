Our writing system also does not communicate with the red people (Russians).

Among the red people, there is an interpreter named Byodoro who understands Japanese somewhat.

The reason Byodoro understands Japanese is that long ago, a merchant from Sai in the northern district of Mutsu Province named Tokubei, leading sixteen people on one ship, drifted to that country.

Those still alive today are five people: Katsuzaemon from Sai in Mutsu Province, Rihachiro from Okuto, Chomatsu from Omamura, and Chosaku and Ihei from Miyakoura. Katsuzaemon serves the lord of Moscow, and Rihachiro has taken Byodoro's sister as his wife. The other three also receive stipends from the lord. It is because he (Tokubei) was relied upon to learn Japanese, as was told to Nitta and others.

Contemporary merchants occasionally purchase these metal fittings and sell them to the public under the name "Ezo Goto." The items now called "emushi" that are newly made and sent to the Ezo are dull forgings made by crude blacksmiths in Matsumae, Akita, Noshiro, and other places. Although the Ezo know well that these are dull, it is said that following the barbarian custom of treasuring weapons, those who do not possess them cannot become the head of a household, so they seek to obtain them.

There are those who possess broken helmet bowls and damaged belly-wraps (armor). They call all armor "ayotuppe" and treasure it greatly.

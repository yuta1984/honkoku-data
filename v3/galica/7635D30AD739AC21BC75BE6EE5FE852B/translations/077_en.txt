On the Red People (Akahito)

Recently, people called "Red People" (the origin of the term "Red People" is unknown; it is simply the Ainu word "fureisham" translated into Japanese. It is similar to how we call the Dutch "red-haired people") have come to Ezo territory and are secretly conducting trade (according to what common people hear and speak of).

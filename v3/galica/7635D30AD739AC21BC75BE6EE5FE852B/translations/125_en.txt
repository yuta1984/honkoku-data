They live in Irkutsk and have each been incorporated among the officers. The details about two of them are unknown. One person was granted the name "Beitarareonsee-e-ichiya" by the Emperor (his Japanese name is unknown). He is said to be nearly eighty years old, but remains healthy and continues his service. His son (whose name I have not heard) possesses intelligence and talent.

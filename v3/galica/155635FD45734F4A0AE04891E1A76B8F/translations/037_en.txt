THE FISH AND THE CORMORANT

　　　There was no pond in all the neighborhood
　　　That a cormorant had not put under contribution:
　　　Fish ponds and reservoirs paid him tribute.
　　　His cuisine went well; but when old age
　　　　Had chilled the poor animal,
　　　　The same cuisine went badly.
Every cormorant serves as his own provider.
Ours, a bit too old to see to the bottom of the waters,
　　　　Having neither nets nor snares,
　　　　Suffered extreme famine.
What did he do? Necessity, doctor of stratagems,
Furnished him with this one. On the edge of a pond
　　　　The cormorant saw a crayfish.
My good neighbor, said he, go at once
　　　　To carry an important warning
　　　　To this people: they must perish;
The master of this place will fish in eight days.
　　　　The crayfish hastily went
　　　　To tell the case. Great is the uproar;
　　　　They run, they assemble, they send deputies
　　　　To the bird: Lord Cormorant,
Where comes this warning from you? What is your guarantee?
　　　　Are you sure of this affair?
Do you know no remedy? And what is good to do?--
Change place, said he. How shall we do it?--
Don't worry about it: I will carry you all,

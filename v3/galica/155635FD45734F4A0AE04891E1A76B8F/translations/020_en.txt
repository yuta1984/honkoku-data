VII
THE FOX WITH HIS TAIL CUT OFF

　　　　An old fox, but one of the craftiest,
　A great devourer of chickens, great catcher of rabbits,
　　　　Smelling of fox from a league away,
　　　　Was finally caught in a trap.
　　By great chance having escaped from it,
Not unscathed, for as proof he left his tail there,
Having, I say, saved himself without a tail and quite ashamed,
To gain companions (as he was clever),
One day when the foxes were holding council among themselves:
What are we doing, said he, with this useless burden,
That goes sweeping all the muddy paths?
What use is this tail to us? We must cut it off:
　　If you believe me, each one will resolve to do so.
Your advice is very good, said someone from the group;
But turn around, please, and we will answer you.
At these words there arose such a hubbub
That the poor bob-tailed one could not be heard.
To claim to remove the tail would have been wasted time.
　　　　The custom was continued.

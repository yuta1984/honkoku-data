　　　　One after another, to my retreat.
None but God alone and I know the paths there:
　　　　There is no dwelling more secret.
A fish pond that Nature dug there with her own hands,
　　　　Unknown to treacherous humans,
　　　　Will save your republic.
　　　　They believed it. The aquatic people
　　　　Were carried one after another
　　　　Under that little-frequented rock.
　　　　There the cormorant, the good apostle,
　　　　Having placed them in a spot
　　　　Transparent, shallow, very narrow,
Caught them without difficulty, one day one, another day another.

　　　　He taught them at their expense
That one should never have confidence
　　　　In those who are eaters of people.
They lost little by it, since the human breed
Would have likewise crunched its good share.
What matters who eats you, man or wolf? Every belly
　　　　Seems the same to me in this regard:
　　　　A day sooner, a day later,
　　　　It's no great difference.

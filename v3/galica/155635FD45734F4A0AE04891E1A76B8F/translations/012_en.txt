　　　　　　V
THE DOVE AND THE ANT

The other example is drawn from smaller animals.
Along a clear stream a dove was drinking,
When an ant, leaning over the water, fell in;
And in this ocean one would have seen the ant
Struggling, but in vain, to regain the shore.
The dove immediately showed charity:
A blade of grass thrown into the water by her
Became a promontory where the ant arrived.
　　　　She saved herself. And thereupon
Passed a certain peasant who walked barefoot;
This peasant, by chance, had a crossbow.
　　　　As soon as he saw the bird of Venus,
He thought it was in his pot, and already celebrated.
While my villager prepared to kill it,
　　　　The ant stung him in the heel.
　　　　The wretch turned his head:
The dove heard it, departed and flew far away.
The peasant's supper flew away with her:
　　　　No pigeon for an obol.

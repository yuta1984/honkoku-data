THE MONKEY AND THE DOLPHIN

It was a custom among the Greeks
That all travelers on the sea
Brought with them on their voyage
Monkeys and performers' dogs.
A ship with such cargo
Shipwrecked not far from Athens.
Without the dolphins all would have perished.
This animal is a great friend

Thought it owed its salvation to this:
A dolphin took it for a man,
And made it sit on its back
So gravely, that one would have thought to see

If you should have some business there,

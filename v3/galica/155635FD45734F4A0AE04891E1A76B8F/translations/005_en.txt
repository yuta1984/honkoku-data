II
THE HARE AND THE FROGS

A hare in his lair was pondering,
(For what is there to do in a lair, unless one ponders?)
In deep melancholy this hare was immersed:
This animal is sad, and fear gnaws at him.

"People of a naturally fearful disposition
Are," he said, "truly miserable!
They cannot eat a morsel that would benefit them!
Never a pure pleasure; always various assaults.
This is how I live; this cursed fear
Prevents me from sleeping, except with eyes open.
Correct yourself, some wise mind would say.
Eh! But can fear be corrected?
I even believe that in good faith
Men are afraid just as I am."

Thus reasoned our hare,
And meanwhile kept watch.
He was doubtful, anxious:
A breath, a shadow, a nothing, everything gave him fever.

The melancholic animal,
While dreaming on this matter,
Heard a slight noise: this was for him a signal
To flee toward his burrow.

He went to pass by the edge of a pond:
Frogs immediately leaped into the waters,
Frogs retreated into their deep caves.

"Oh!" he said, "I make others do the same
As others make me do! My presence
Also frightens people! I sound the alarm in the camp:
And whence comes this valor to me?
What! Animals that tremble before me!
Am I then a thunderbolt of war!"

There is not, I see it well, such a coward on earth
Who cannot find one more cowardly than himself.

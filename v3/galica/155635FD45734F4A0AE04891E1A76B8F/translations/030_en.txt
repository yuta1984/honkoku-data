　　　　　A pack of hounds settled the quarrel.
The cat said to the fox: "Search in your bag, friend;
　　　　Seek in your cunning brain
A sure stratagem: as for me, here is mine."
At these words, he climbed up a tree quite well.
　　　　The other tried a hundred useless tricks,
Entered a hundred burrows, a hundred times tried to outwit
　　　　All the colleagues of Brifaut.
　　　　Everywhere he sought refuges,
　　　　And everywhere it was without success:
The smoke provided for that, as well as the bassets.
Upon exiting a burrow, two swift-footed dogs
　　　　Strangled him with their first leap.

Too many expedients can spoil an affair:
One loses time in choosing, one tries, one wants to do everything.
　　　　Let us have but one, but let it be good.

　　　　　　XI
THE CRAYFISH AND HER DAUGHTER

　　The wise sometimes, like the crayfish,
Walk backwards, turning their backs to the port.
This is the art of sailors; it is also the artifice
Of those who, to conceal some powerful effort,
Face a point directly opposite,
And make their adversary run toward that place.
My subject is small, this lesson is great:
I could apply it to a certain conqueror
Who alone disconcerts a league of a hundred heads.
What he does not undertake, and what he undertakes,
Is at first only a secret, then becomes conquests.
In vain do we keep our eyes on what he wants to hide,
These are decrees of Fate that cannot be prevented:
The torrent finally becomes insurmountable.
A hundred gods are powerless against one Jupiter.
Louis and Destiny seem to me in concert
To drag along the universe. Let us come to our fable.
Mother crayfish one day said to her daughter:
"How you walk, good God! Can you not walk straight?"—
"And how do you walk yourself," said the daughter:
"Can I walk otherwise than my family does?
Do you want me to go straight when you go crooked?"

　　　　She was right: the virtue
　　　　Of every domestic example
　　　　Is universal and applies
In good, in evil, in everything, makes wise men, fools,
Many more of the latter. As for turning one's back
On one's goal, I return to it; the method is good,
　　　　Especially in the trade of Bellona;
　　　　But it must be done at the right time.

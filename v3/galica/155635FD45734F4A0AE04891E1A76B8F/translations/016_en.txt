The rat was attached by the paw to its foot;
　　　　A blade of rush served the purpose.
Having entered the marsh, our good neighbor
Strives to drag her guest to the bottom of the water,
Against the law of nations, against sworn faith,
Pretends that she will make a fine feast of him.
It was, in her opinion, an excellent morsel.
Already, in her mind, the rogue devours him,
He calls upon the gods; the traitor mocks him:
He resists, she pulls. In this new combat,
A kite that was soaring in the air, making rounds,
Sees from above the poor creature struggling on the wave.
It swoops down, seizes him, and, by the same means,
　　　　The frog and the bond.
　　　　All were taken; so well and thoroughly,
　　　　That from this double prey
　　　　The bird gives itself heart's joy,
　　　　Having, in this fashion,
　　　　Both meat and fish for supper.

　　　　The most skillfully woven ruse
　　　　May harm its inventor,
　　　　And often perfidy
　　　　Returns upon its author.

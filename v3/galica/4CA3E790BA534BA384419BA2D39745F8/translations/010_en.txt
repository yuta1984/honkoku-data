Eighth Month (August)
　Deer-Crying Grass (Bush Clover)
As autumn deepens, what color will it be?
In the blowing wind,
the bush clover of the original fields
will soon change its hues

　First Wild Geese
Gazing thoughtfully
as more than half of autumn has passed
at the cedar door,
the voice of the first wild geese
is clearly heard as I wait

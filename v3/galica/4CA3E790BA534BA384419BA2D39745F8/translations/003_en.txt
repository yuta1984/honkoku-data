First Month (January)
　Willow
Is this the color of the spring wind
that bends the willow branches?
The green willow threads
deepening in hue with each passing day

　Bush Warbler
Spring has come and many nights have passed—
at the morning gate
I hear the bush warbler singing
in the bamboo grove by my window

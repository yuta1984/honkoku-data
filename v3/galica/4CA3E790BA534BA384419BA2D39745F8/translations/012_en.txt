Tenth Month (October)
　Late-blooming Chrysanthemums
In the frosty nights of the godless month
　the fragrance of chrysanthemums
　as mementos of autumn—
　　what shall we await?
　Cranes
In the evening sun's light, flocking together
　　with wings spread as they take flight
　autumn rain clouds
　　circle around the mountains

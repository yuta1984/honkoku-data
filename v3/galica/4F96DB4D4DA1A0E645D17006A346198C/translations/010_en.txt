The disciples who studied under the master could not master the Katsushika style without obtaining the master's model drawings. Why do they not realize this? The master found these words reasonable, and created drawings of everything from landscapes, figures, birds and beasts, plants and trees, to buildings and utensils - all things of beauty and color - carved them into woodblocks, and gave them to his students. Gradually, this reached eight volumes.

I was asked to write a preface, but since I do not understand painting, I cannot discuss the art of painting. Therefore, I shall record the reasons why this collection came to be, and let this serve as the preface instead.

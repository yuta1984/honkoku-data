The Gourd Military Tales in Fifty-four Scenes
　　　　Illustrated by Ichieisai Hōen, a series of fifty-four prints

From the sixty-odd provinces of Japan, needless to say,
to Korea, which was brought under his dominion,
[this depicts] the lifetime of Lord Taikō Hideyoshi, from when
his childhood name was called Sarunosuke, beginning with
his encounter with Kajitsuka Yoroku on the bridge at Yahagi
in Mikawa Province, through to the triumphant
return from the siege of Odawara in Sagami Province—
fifty-four scenes of large nishiki-e prints, with the title
"The Gourd Military Tales."

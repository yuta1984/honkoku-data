What should serve as the conclusion—could there be anything that surpasses this book? Moreover, in this book, without even painting the wind itself, the atmosphere of wind appears distinctly clear; showing dew plainly, the weighty appearance of branches, the colors of flowers blooming and spilling over, the beautiful fragrance of ink from charcoal drawing—though these are simplified, they all appear as if they were the real thing. Even if one were to follow the ancient Chinese legend of the ten days and shoot a single arrow, or follow the legend of five days and paint a single stone, and even if one were to possess the six principles and observe the twelve taboos, it would be difficult for anything to surpass this book. Thus writes Hira Yuzuru, the master of this book, in the twelfth month of the tenth year of Bunka.

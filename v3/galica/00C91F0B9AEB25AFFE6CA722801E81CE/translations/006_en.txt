How could it possibly reach such heights? The great theater of "What is this?"* The leading actor sits in his chair.
Glaring at the walls of the dressing room. Meditation beans from the lunch box. In the empty and silent
rice with tea. Contemplating the twelve causes and conditions with one meal. Both legs bending and
receiving punishment from the Great King of the Entertainment Quarter are the harsh words of dismissal. Cause and effect revolve in
an ancient great mechanism. The hind legs of a horse from a previous life tear through the present iris-leather
haori jacket. In the future, they beat the drums of the dressing room. Therefore,
thinking of this: the sorrows of the opening act. The splendor of the second act.
The final act's      scolding and berating. These are precisely the present world, past, and future. Combined,
the three worlds become   three theaters. The antagonist of the desire realm. The love scenes of the form realm.

If one becomes flustered in the opposite gallery of desires, even if one asks for directions at the lodging of a knowledgeable guide,
it would be difficult to reach the main stage of original enlightenment. Ah,
truly, in the two-block town of both the deluded mind and the path of enlightenment. Young attendant of the floating world teahouse,
if your hands make sound, realize that you are a sake server—
so it is said. At this time, in the frost month of Kansei Kōshin year. Around the time when spring comedies
begin their storytelling. In response to the publisher's request

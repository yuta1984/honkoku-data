This was known as the standard practice of the government office. Generally speaking, what the country people called "kanban" (signboards) appeared to be official notices, with calligraphy spread across the entire surface that was as difficult to read as if one had stepped on excrement left by a Kunlun person (black person) in the darkness, or resembling a cloth merchant's sales records or a doctor's ginger prescriptions - not a single character could be read. For those who were educated, there was a separate system of governance that expressed the full range of human emotions - joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure - rewarding good and punishing evil, properly teaching and guiding them. Looking at the clothing of those who guarded this government office, though it was not particularly a cold country, they wore thickly cotton-padded haori jackets in various dyed colors, mostly clove-brown and light green. They wore fresh hand towels pulled over their heads in multiple crosswise folds or casually draped, sat in singing posture in rows, opened black-ribbed fans with red lacquered family crests, and called out in beautiful voices, "Stage, stage, let's do the stage!" Then someone would climb onto a high platform and read from a scroll, saying things like "nakayo, nakayo," and when finished, a large crowd would stand up.

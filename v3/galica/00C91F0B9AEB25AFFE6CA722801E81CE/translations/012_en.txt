◯Based on the words of a courtesan who said "the backstage of theaters" was something worth seeing, this work depicts actors'
　natural faces without makeup, and includes as an appendix the "Island Tour of Kabuki Land" by the late sixth-generation Ichikawa Sanshō.
　The purpose follows the example of the reading book character Wasō
　Hyōe, making it a popular novel close to common tastes. Therefore, if this book serves to
　dispel drowsiness during evening conversations and provide rest from the fatigue of night work, it will naturally
　become a friend that comforts the heart.
◯Comparing actors to the first butterflies of Mount Fuji in summer, beginning with the New Year ceremonies of the three theaters, ending with a picture of Minshi (Arashi Hinasuke, Yoshidaya) taking
　the name Naritaya. This refers to the fact that the late Hinasuke, when he came down to Edo in previous years, appeared at the end of "Summer Fuji."
◯Following the custom of actor identification, actors' names are written throughout the pictures. For this reason, though the pictures and text may seem
　tedious, this is not intended for true Edoites or theater connoisseurs.
　As a souvenir from the East, when it reaches the ends of distant lands, "if the nose is high, it's Danjū"

Even Hitchōbō would find it difficult to ride on the house's hat pin. That kyōgen performance has its form behind the curtain, with one voice resounding on the main stage - the "Shibaraku" of Naritaya's young master never ceases. When the image of Shinozuka is carved on the chest of a chivalrous man, even the one-armed Inokuma Nyūdō, who was completely trusted, is like a supporting catfish priest. The carp's ascent up the waterfall is already like a dragon, and those who hear his chanting voice stir up clouds. If there are the steaming baskets of Toraya that can roar, there are fan paintings that generate wind. There are those called into the mysterious latticed storefronts. Country folk on their Edo sightseeing all prioritize seeing Danjūrō first in the cheap seats. In the rough-style plays that are the house specialty, they crush their livers along with the fried rice in their lunch boxes. The guides, proud of their three-shō capacity, seek single-sheet prints with prominent noses to seal in their elder brothers' protective pouches for lifelong health and longevity as blessed purification. Living in neighboring shops, whether people of the capital or countryside, high or low in status, there was no one who remained unmoved. However, in the spring of the past Year of the Sheep, he performed the debut role of Sukeroku for his grandfather's twenty-third memorial service. Not knowing the color of that headband, as if seeing his grandfather's visage before his very eyes, the front crossing of the hanamichi opens once again.

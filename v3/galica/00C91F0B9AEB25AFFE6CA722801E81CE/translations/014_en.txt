<<Title: Kabuki Kinmō Zui (Kabuki Primer Illustrated) <<Complete in five volumes, illustrated reader｜Joint work by Edo artists｜Written by Shikitei Sanba>>>>
Leaving the theaters of Kyoto and Osaka to Hachimonja Jishō without further comment, we liken the three theater districts of Edo to a single country, comparing it to the Chinese Kinmō Zui, dividing it into thirteen categories starting from heaven and earth and seasons through to numbers and language. We commissioned various master artists of Edo ukiyo-e to add detailed illustrations throughout, added theatrical annotations alongside, and without selecting arbitrary theories, we referenced the various theories of ancient sages in accordance with national customs. This is truly a complete guide to theater, an unprecedented resource for resolving doubts among connoisseurs. Theater enthusiasts and gentlemen should not fail to see this, says the publisher.

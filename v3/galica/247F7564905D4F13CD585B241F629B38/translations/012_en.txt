On the morning of New Year's Day of the past month, when passing by the edge of the bamboo blinds, the four or five court ladies were fanning the incense that had been burning, with smoke still rising even today—what thoughtless behavior it was. Though they acted heartlessly and intimidated those around them, it is sad that my humble commoner's heart made them think, "Yet I am trembling with excitement despite being of such lowly status." The princess must have observed this and looked upon me with indifference. Who could have reported this and caused her to visit the palace? How distressing it was. Now that I know this, why have I lived so long only to witness such painful scenes? As I continued to brood deeply, I thought that tonight they would surely retire together in the imperial bedchamber without any barriers between them.

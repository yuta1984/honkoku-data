Tartar (Tatar) has the original name Datsu-ji-tan (韃而靼), but nowadays the character "而" (ji) is omitted. This country has two types, eastern-western and black-white, with numerous tribes, and is a great nation divided into forty-eight districts along its borders. It was called Kokoku (胡国) in ancient times, or sometimes called Mōko (蒙古, Mongolia) - these are all alternative names for this country. Its southern border adjoins China, while the north is close to the frozen sea in an extremely cold region where the length of the four seasons and day and night differ greatly from other places in many locations. It is said to be the most prosperous country. The people favor archery and horsemanship, with brave and strong customs. It extends from 43 degrees to 64 degrees from the North Pole, being short from north to south and long from east to west.

The small people (shōjin) are from a country called Hachia (Bohemia). It is located in the northeastern corner of Europe, with the northern region extending to the frozen sea. It is an extremely cold country where daylight continues for half the year and night continues for the other half.
It is传说传说传说 that people's height is one shaku and two to three sun. However, in reality they are said to be over two shaku tall. In China they are called "short people" (tanjin), and this refers to the same thing.

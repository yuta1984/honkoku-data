Java is a distant country located to the southwest of China. It is an extremely hot country where the seasonal order of cold and heat is completely opposite to that of countries such as China and Japan, making it very different. Jakarta, where the Dutch people who currently come to Japan reside, is also at the northern tip of this country. Therefore, we do not separately illustrate people. The North Pole is not visible, and it is 6 or 7 degrees south of the South Pole region.

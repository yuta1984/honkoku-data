Polonia (Boronia) is a very cold country located to the east of Holland within Europe. The people of this country have courteous and gentle customs, and there are absolutely no bandits throughout the nation. They do not even know of the existence of bandits in their daily lives. The king and ministers preserve the ancient national laws without making any changes whatsoever. Also, to the southeast of this country, at the western border of India, there is a country called Judea. Six thousand years ago, a sage established the national laws there. Those records have been preserved without loss to this day, and the king and ministers guard those records while governing the country without making any errors. Truly, these countries are said to be lands of abundance.

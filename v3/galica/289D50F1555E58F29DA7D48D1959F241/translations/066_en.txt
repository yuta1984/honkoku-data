Kafuri (Cafri) is a large nation within Africa, in a very hot country. Their customs are base, the common people have very black skin color, are strong and hardy, and know no fear of death. They are simple and honest, and when they become slaves to others, they serve their masters with great loyalty. For this reason, the European nations purchase people from this country to make them slaves. The homeland of this country is called Monomotatsupaa.

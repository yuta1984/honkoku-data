The illustrated figures of these forty-two countries are based on people from various nations with whom the barbarians and red-haired foreigners conducted trade and traveled during that time. These were copied from drawings made by artists of those foreign countries and then illustrated by painters in Nagasaki, which is how they came to spread throughout the world. Besides these figures, it is said there are many other strange countries, but since there is no contact with barbarians or red-haired foreigners from those places, and their traditions are not yet clearly transmitted, such countries have been excluded. Originally there were forty countries, but later people increased the number to forty-two. Therefore, it is named after these forty-two countries. The illustrated commentary was compiled based on the oral accounts of elders in Nagasaki.

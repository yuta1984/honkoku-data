Chinese lotus (tōren)
【Outside the box】The flowers are numerous in number, with buds that are red, or red at the base, or extremely red, and there are also white flowers. There are varieties called golden thread lotus and silver thread lotus, which have vein-like patterns visible on the petals. There is also Indian lotus.
The color is true red, petals are narrow, buds are small, and the petals fold inward like ten thousand petals. There are also white flowers, white with lotus red, and large lotus with true red and white blooming separately. ○Generally, lotus first produces floating leaves, second-tier leaves, and third-tier leaves before producing flower buds. The leaves gradually flourish and the flowers open.
The flowers open, then fall and become seed pods. Floating leaves refer to those that float and drift on the water's surface. Second-tier leaves are those that emerge next, rising slightly above the water to open, called "second tier." Third-tier leaves are those that stand upright above the second tier. Third-tier leaves emerge, produce buds, the leaves flourish, flowers open, and after opening and falling, become seed pods. When painting lotus leaves, first make the leaves flourish, then arrange flowers slightly below the leaves. When painting lotus flowers, arrange leaves slightly below the flowers. When painting lotus, raise the lotus pod high and arrange both leaves and flowers slightly below.
Sometimes scatter the flowers, wither the leaves and put them in water. The lotus pod seeds fly and lodge in the soil. Buds emerge, flowers flourish, and pod seeds fly. These three represent past, present, and future.

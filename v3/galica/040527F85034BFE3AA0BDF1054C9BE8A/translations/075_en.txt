Small with leaves like stone calamus, flowers emerge on needle-like stalks with many branches ending in star-like round formations. White colored with shine, resembling stars. This is named Star Grass. Another variety exists with larger leaves and smaller, fewer flowers. ○Su Song's statement that it "grows in grain fields, blooms in March, resembles small round stars" is incorrect. Though the form matches, it's not visible in February-March. ○Shi Zhen says "grows in barren fields after grain harvest, thin stems 4-5 inches tall, small white flowers on stem tops like scattered stars, flowers picked in September." Though the timing fits well, this is not so. Being extremely small grass, it struggles to grow against other weeds. ○Alternative names: Loaded Star Grass, Literary Star Grass, Shooting Star Grass.

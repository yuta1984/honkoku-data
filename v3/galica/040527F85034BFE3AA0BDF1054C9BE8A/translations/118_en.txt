【Heading, boxed section】Narcissus flower (suisen-ka)
【Outside the box】The leaves resemble cattails. The flower shape is likened to a golden cup and silver stand (kinsan-gindai). There are six petals. The base is triangular and long. The stem resembles spatterdock. Also, the flower is initially wrapped in a thin silk bag, and when the bag opens, the flower blooms. The flower color is white and slightly pale. In the center cup there are three orbs. Both the one cup and three orbs are yellow turmeric color. Flowers appear from August until February or March of the following year. Autumn and winter narcissus have flowers in the middle section of the leaves. Also, spring narcissus flowers, compared to the height of leaves, generally follow this pattern where summer and autumn flowering plants are tall, while winter and spring flowering plants are short. Four-season flowering plants continue year-round without cease. However, while autumn and winter flowering plants cannot endure the winter climate and wither before waiting for spring, narcissus emerges with its golden cup and silver stand from the thin silk bag, and without waiting for spring, when spring flowers arrive, it serves as the flower that forms and connects the bond that brings them together with its single cup.

○Yang Chengzhai says: "The world considers narcissus to be golden cup and silver stand. Probably among single-petal varieties there is one wine cup, deep yellow and golden in color. The thousand-petal (double) varieties are indeed true narcissus." ○Shangu says: "An alternative name is 'immortal bone' (senkotsu). Narcissus flowers are not ordinary flowers. They have the form of immortal bones. Therefore they are called immortal bone."

△Flower arrangement (coloring method): Paint the center line with gofun (white pigment), similarly apply shading to both sides of the center line with white-green, for the fragrance dish apply gofun base with white-green shading to the fragrance orbs. Also, for the entire flower, apply a mixture of verdigris and gofun. Apply vermillion-yellow to both the center orbs and dish. For the base leaves and stems, apply shading with fourth-grade sixth-blue grass juice and apply vermillion-yellow. For the bag wrapping the flower, apply gofun and yellow ochre, scatter and apply shading with vermillion ink, and draw lines. For the leaf base area, apply yellow over gofun paste with vermillion ink. Draw lines with grass juice.

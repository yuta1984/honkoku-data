**Gojika (Four o'clock flower)** *Flowering period: June-July | Also called Kinsenka (Coin flower) | or Shigoка (Noon-midnight flower)*
The leaf shape resembles ivy grass, but the serrated edges are small and the leaves are hairy. The flower shape resembles Japanese quince flowers with pointed tips, opening sideways. Similar to red quince but with an even deeper crimson color, very beautiful. The flower calyx has very sharp, strong points, with five red stamens standing inside and one pistil standing in the center. Both stamens and pistils are red. At the base of the petals there is peach color, followed by a little purple. This pistil is entirely red. The receptacle resembles that of Catharanthus, but without seed swelling. The buds resemble seeds, and the seeds resemble buds. Plant height is about 1-2 feet.

**Kintaika (Weigela)**  
*Also called: Yūnishiki (Evening brocade)*
The leaves resemble chili peppers. There are large and small leaves, and the flowers resemble mountain cherry blossoms. The flower stems are long with receptacles far below.

**Sennōka (Rose campion)**  
*Senshūra (Autumn-blooming campion)*
Both flowers and leaves resemble Wikstroemia. Colors include original red, white, light red, and purple. There are purple streaked varieties and variegated ones. Plant height about 2 feet, flowers bloom in June-July.

Senshunra (Spring campion) has five varieties. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each have their seasonal names. The spring-summer varieties are yellow-red in color and not particularly beautiful. Only the autumn-winter ones have deep red color and beautiful appearance. Seeds are also divided in spring time. There is also one variety with golden-yellow color that is extremely beautiful, called *Kinsenra* (Golden campion).

**Nokogiri-sō (Yarrow)**  
*Also called: Gangi-sō | also Moshio-sō, also | Hakoromo*
One plant produces 20-30 stems. Plant height about 2 feet. Leaves are narrow and long with serrated edges. Flowers open during summer and autumn. Resembles small chrysanthemum flowers. Colors are red and white. Red flowers are considered superior quality. Flowers appear in May, and those appearing at the end of September are red-purple in color.

This matches the description in the *Bencao Tujing* (Illustrated Classic of Materia Medica) and other sources. Its growth habit is like mugwort, forming clumps, 5-6 feet tall, with 10-20 stems per plant. Flowers appear after autumn, emerging from branch tips. Red-purple in color, shaped like chrysanthemums. This corresponds well. ○ The *Records of the Grand Historian* in the "Treatise on the Turtle and Yarrow Stalks" describes the form of yarrow in extremely strange terms, but one should not believe everything indiscriminately. One should only revere it as sacred. ○ The *Book of Songs* states "soaking those bundled yarrow stalks" *[Ge Feng | Quan Zhang]*, and Zhu Xi's commentary notes that "yarrow refers to divination grass."

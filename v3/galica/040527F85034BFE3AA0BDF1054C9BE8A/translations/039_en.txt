[Heading, boxed section] Ōkei (Yellow Cymbidium) [Outside box] The leaves resemble those of Shiran (Bletilla striata), broad and soft. The flower shape is like an orchid, with a color of fine turmeric yellow. Some have white spots on the leaves, others have yellow spots. This is also called "hoshi-kei," "hoshi-ganzekirk," or "ko-kei." There are bulbs at the base of the roots, like those of Ganzeki (Cymbidium kanran). Flowers bloom in the fourth month.

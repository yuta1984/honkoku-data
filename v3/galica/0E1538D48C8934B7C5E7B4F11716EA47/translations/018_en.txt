VI
THE FOX AND THE STORK

Friend Fox one day decided to entertain,
And invited his companion the Stork to dinner.
This feast was modest and without much preparation.
　　　　The fellow, for all his efforts,
Had prepared a thin broth; he lived frugally.
This broth was served by him on a plate:
The long-beaked Stork could not catch a morsel;
And the rascal had lapped it all up in a moment.
　　To avenge this deception,
Some time later the Stork invited him.
Gladly, he said; for with my friends
　　　　I don't stand on ceremony.
　　At the appointed hour, he ran to the dwelling
　　　　Of the Stork, his hostess;
　　　　Praised her politeness highly;
　　　　Found the dinner cooked to perfection.
Good appetite above all: foxes never lack it.
He rejoiced at the smell of the meat,
Cut into small pieces, which he thought delicious.

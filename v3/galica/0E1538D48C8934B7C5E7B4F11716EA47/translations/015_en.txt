V
THE DRAGON WITH MANY HEADS AND THE
　　DRAGON WITH MANY TAILS

　　An envoy of the Great Lord
Preferred, so history tells, one day before the Emperor,
His master's forces to those of the Empire.
　　A German began to say:
　　Our prince has dependents
　　Who are so powerful as their chiefs,
That each of them could hire an army.
　　The chiaus, a man of sense,
　　Said to him: I know by reputation
What forces each elector can provide;
　　And this reminds me
Of a strange adventure, which is nevertheless true.
I was in a safe place when I saw pass
The hundred heads of a hydra through a hedge.
　　My blood began to freeze;
　　And I believe one would be frightened by less.
I had, however, only the fear without the harm;
　　Never could the body of the animal
Come toward me or find an opening.
　　I was pondering this adventure,
When another dragon appeared, which had only one head
But more than one tail to pass through.
　　There I was seized again
　　With astonishment and terror.
This head passes, and the body, and each tail as well.
Nothing stopped them; one made way for the other.
　　I maintain that it is the same
　　With your emperor and ours.

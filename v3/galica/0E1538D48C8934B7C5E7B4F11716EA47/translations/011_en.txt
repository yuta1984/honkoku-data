THE SWALLOW AND THE LITTLE BIRDS

A swallow in her travels
Had learned much. Whoever has seen much
Can have retained much.
This one foresaw even the smallest storms,
And, before they came to pass,
Announced them to the sailors.
It happened that at the time when hemp is sown,
She saw a peasant covering many furrows with it.
This does not please me, she said to the little birds:
I pity you; for, as for me, in this extreme peril,
I shall know how to distance myself, or live in some corner.
Do you see this hand that travels through the air?
A day will come, which is not far off,
When what it spreads will be your ruin.
From there will be born devices to envelop you,
And snares to catch you,
Finally many and many a machine
That will cause in the season
Your death or your prison:
Beware the cage or the cauldron!
This is why, the swallow told them,
Eat this grain, and believe me.
The birds mocked her:
They found too much to eat in the fields.
When the hemp field was green,
The swallow said to them: Pull up blade by blade
What this cursed grain has produced,
Or be sure of your loss.
Prophet of misfortune! chatterbox! they said,

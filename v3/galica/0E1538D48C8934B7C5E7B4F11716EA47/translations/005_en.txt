and they are numerous, thanks to the brush of the celebrated Utamaro, whose works are so sought after today, particularly the one to which we are alluding.

Finally, Kajita Hanko, a pupil of Yōsai, who was declared during his lifetime by the current Emperor to be the greatest painter of his time, undertook to paint for us "The Cicada" going to implore "The Ant," her neighbor. He represents her so unfortunate, she seems in such present need that one cannot help but be moved in the presence of such great misfortune. We do not think the subject could be better treated. All the fables illustrated by this master of great talent, though still young, are treated with the same artistic sentiment that he knows how to impress upon all his works.

Is it necessary to add that we have not shrunk from any sacrifice to offer to the enthusiasts to whom this first attempt is addressed a work worthy of our great Fabulist and of the eminent Japanese artists who were kind enough to lend us their assistance; we address to them here our most sincere thanks and our congratulations.

Our goal in publishing this work is to make known to those who occupy themselves with this most interesting branch of the art of drawing, the genre for which we are absolutely indebted to this constellation of Japanese artists of whom Sesshū, the Kanō, Kōrin in the past; Ōkyo, Utamaro, Hokusai, Hiroshige in an era closer to us, are the leaders, and whose remarkable works are increasingly appreciated by artists of all countries and all schools.

Tale VII
THE ROOSTER AND THE PEARL

One day a rooster found
A pearl, which he gave
To the first jeweler he met.
"I believe it to be fine," said he;
"But the smallest grain of millet
Would suit my needs much better."
An ignorant man inherited
A manuscript which he brought
To his neighbor the bookseller.
"I believe it to be good," said he;
"But the smallest ducatoon
Would suit my needs much better."

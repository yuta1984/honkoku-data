VIII
THE WOLF PLEADING AGAINST THE FOX
BEFORE THE MONKEY

A wolf claimed that he had been robbed:
A fox, his neighbor, of rather bad reputation,
Was summoned for this alleged theft.
The case was pleaded before the monkey,
Not by lawyers, but by each party themselves.
Themis had never worked on
A more tangled case, within monkey memory.
The magistrate sweated on his judgment seat.
After they had contested well,
Replied, cried, and raged,
The judge, informed of their malice,
Said to them: "I have known you for a long time, my friends,
And you will both pay the fine:
For you, wolf, you complain, though nothing was taken from you;
And you, fox, have taken what is demanded of you."

The judge believed that haphazardly,
One could not go wrong when condemning a scoundrel.

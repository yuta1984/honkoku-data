　　　　　　XI 
THE BIRD WOUNDED BY AN ARROW

　　Mortally struck by a feathered arrow,
　　A bird lamented its sad destiny,
　　And said, while suffering additional pain:
　　Must one contribute to one's own misfortune!
　　　　Cruel humans, you take from our wings
The means to make these deadly machines fly!
But do not mock, pitiless race:
Often a fate like ours befalls you.

Of the children of Iapetus, always one half
　　　　Will furnish arms to the other.

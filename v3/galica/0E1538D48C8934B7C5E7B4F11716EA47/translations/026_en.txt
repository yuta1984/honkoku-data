Springs from a good nature; but abandon this worry:
　　The winds are less fearsome to me than to you;
I bend and do not break. You have until now
　　　　Against their terrible blows
　　　　Resisted without bending your back;
But let us wait for the end. As he spoke these words,
From the edge of the horizon rushes with fury
　　　　The most terrible of the children
That the North had carried thus far in its flanks.
　　　　The tree holds firm, the reed bends.
　　　　The wind doubles its efforts,
　　　　And succeeds so well that it uproots
The one whose head was neighbor to the sky,
And whose feet touched the empire of the dead.

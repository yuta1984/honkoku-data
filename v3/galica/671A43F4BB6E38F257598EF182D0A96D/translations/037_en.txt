Sometimes it subsides, and when the weather becomes clear and fine, the reinforcements withdraw. From throughout the domain and other territories, from the castle town, Lord Tsugaru's retainers and others, and even townspeople and farmers from the upper mountain areas come out to that beach to gather and seek arrowheads. There are very many in the sand and in the sea. When one possesses these arrowhead stones, evil spirits do not approach, and if taken with water, they cure malaria. They are regarded as godlike for protection against bullets, stones, and arrows. Children keep them in protective pouches, and adults use them as menuki ornaments for swords and short swords, treating them as extremely precious things in this region. This beach, extending over one ri and more than three ri in width, is a place where there are no plants or small stones, [the sand being fine] like rice flour.

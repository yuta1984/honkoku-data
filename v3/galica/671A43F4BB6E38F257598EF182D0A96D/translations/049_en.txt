Divine Spear - Twenty-two

This is also a rare stone that I treasure. It belongs to the same category as the sword stone, but its form is greatly different. Its color is like lacquer with a brilliant luster. It is seven sun and five bu in length, with a pointed tip and something round at the base. The broken surface shows a thickness of about three to four bu. These are sometimes found at Mount Haguro in Dewa Province. The local people call them "divine spears."

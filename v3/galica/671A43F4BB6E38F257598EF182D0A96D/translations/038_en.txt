It is fine white sand. The divine presence (of Ōmono-imi Ōkami) is always awe-inspiring. Now, in the aftermath of that divine battle, ordinary arrowheads are rarely found. These are said to be arrowheads offered by those who made vows at the shrine. Hundreds of them are presented before the deity throughout the year, but they all scatter and are lost without a single one remaining due to wind and rain. Also, whoever offers them, there are many arrows fletched with mountain pheasant feathers before the treasure hall. These too are said to scatter away at that time. I do not know whether this is true or not. When I consider the places in our country that produce arrowhead stones, there are rarely large ones in the fields and mountains of Nishi-Tanba-ichi, west of Furu Shrine, three ri east of Hōryūji Temple in Yamato Province. There are rare ones in Mifuchi Village in Owari Province.

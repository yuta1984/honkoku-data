It resembles gold-copper ore or serpentine stone. Also, Mr. Miyake from Ishihara Village in Kani District of Mino Province brought the same object wrapped up last year. He said it was from the Kamatsu Valley of Mount Kiso. It is no different from the specimen I have in my collection. Considering this, it is not a type of ore, serpentine stone, or amber from various provinces, but rather a distinct separate substance. In Sado, this is called "kinchichiri," and in Mino it is called "notafukuri."

According to one theory, it is also found on Mount Tenshin in Ishihara Village, Kani District, Mino Province.

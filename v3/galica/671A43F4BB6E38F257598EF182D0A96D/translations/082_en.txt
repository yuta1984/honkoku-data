He brought them back, but they were very small, measuring only two to three bu (about 6-9mm). However, they were of the same type and nature. Is this not also strange? Furthermore, a man named Yawasuke from Tonomura in Johana Village, Tonami District, Etchu Province, came in the sixth month of An'ei 6 (1777) and said that he had relatives in a place called Shima in Noto Province. Eight years ago, his house was shaking continuously and would not stop. After about two days it finally ceased, and when it did, a tengu claw stone was found standing in the pillar of the front gate. Half of it was embedded in the pillar and half protruded out. They called a carpenter to dig it out, and it measured one shaku, one sun, seven bu in length (about 35.5cm), seven sun, five bu in width (about 22.7cm), and two sun, six to seven bu in thickness (about 8cm). It is treasured to this day as a family heirloom.

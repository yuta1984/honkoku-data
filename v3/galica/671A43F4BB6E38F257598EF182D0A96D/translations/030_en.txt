he obtained one object. When washed with water and examined, it was two objects about the size of peaches arranged side by side, black in color and made of hard stone - a natural stone showing Ebisu and Daikoku seated together. Though it appeared to be carved, it was a natural formation resembling carved figures, and was said to be a very beautiful stone. He treasured it greatly and it has been passed down to this day, but this person moved to another province and no longer lives in Ōtsu. Also, <<I>> possess a natural stone showing both deities seated side by side. It is about the size of an open hand and yellowish-red in color. When viewed from one side, the two gods can be seen, while the other side shows a natural fracture surface. It comes from Tobadani in the mountains behind Taga Shrine in Ōmi Province. Many are produced in this area. The local people call them "human-figure stones." The provenance is from the abbot of Shōsōji Temple at Tsuchida, Hachimanyama, Ōmi Province.

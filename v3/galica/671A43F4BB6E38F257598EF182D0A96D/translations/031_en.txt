　　Daikoku Stone　Thirty-nine
In Kawachi Province, there is a place called Ōguro Village, Daikoku Valley. Since there is a famous Daikokuten deity at this mountain, it became the village name. The local people say that every day a natural Daikoku stone flows out, which faithful people can pick up, but unfaithful people cannot obtain. The one <<I>> treasure is indeed a product of this place. It is about the size of a fist, black and hard. It does not have complete facial features but is a resembling form. Also, along the Tōkaidō at Saya-no-Nakayama in Kikugawa, there is an innkeeper called Tachibana-ya (retired) Yamagata-ya.

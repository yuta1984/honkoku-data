According to this man, about ten years ago, at a place called Kumaishi in a bay adjacent to Esashi village, there was exactly one of these objects at the spot where lightning had struck. The local children and villagers said that "the thunder god had left behind a drumstick for a large drum." This rumor gradually spread far and wide, causing great commotion within a radius of three to four ri. Because of this, they built a small shrine called Raiden (Thunder Hall) and enshrined the object there.

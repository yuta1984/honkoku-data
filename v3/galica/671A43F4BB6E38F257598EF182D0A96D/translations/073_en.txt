from the mountains of a place called Kumaishi in Kinko. In my opinion, according to the Zangqi section of the Bencao Gangmu: "Those obtained after thunder and lightning are not of blue-black mottled pattern in form, but are extremely hard like jade. Some say these are stone objects made by humans and offered to the heavenly court, not knowing the facts." This theory seems quite plausible. The form is as shown in the illustration.

In the ninth month of An'ei 7 (1778), year of the Dog, excavated at a place called Kumaishi on the border between Matsumae and Ezo. The form is as shown in the illustration, with a thickness of one sun (about 3 cm).

Kumaishi: At this place there is a shrine called Raisha (Thunder Shrine). When divine age strange stones are excavated, they are enshrined in this shrine.

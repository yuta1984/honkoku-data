According to the "Shoku Nihon Kōki" (Later Chronicles of Japan Continued), in the sixth year of Jōwa era, a report came from Dewa Province. On the twenty-ninth day of the eighth month past, in the area spanning fifty-some ri from the western beach of Tagawa District to the provincial capital, there had originally been no stones. However, from the third day of the eighth month, continuous rain did not cease, thunder and lightning were severe, and after more than ten days when clear weather was finally seen, stones naturally fell from the seashore. Their number was not small - some resembled arrowheads and spear points, some were white, some black, and others blue and red. Also, according to the "Sandai Jitsuroku" (True Record of Three Reigns), on the twenty-first day of the sixth month of the first year of Nin'wa era, stone arrowheads rained down in Akita Castle of Dewa Province and on the western beach of Kami Shrine in Akumi District. It also states that in the second month of the same year, stone arrowheads fell around shrines in the various mountains of Akumi District in Dewa Province.

There are no words that I could possibly say about the state of my
existence. I wonder what will happen in the next world? Rather than
having such thoughts as these now, even my layered
pillows bring only sorrow, and there is no respite from my tears," she lamented, saying "Now even
this dewdrop-like life has no place
to rest," appearing utterly helpless.
The attendant, weeping, said:
"Ah, what a pitiful state you are in!
Even so, please strengthen
your heart and once more see those beloved
persons whom you long for," she pleaded.

Weeping, the princess said: "Now, as for myself,
because of those beloved people, I have no
hope left, but that is what I deeply trust in, even into the next
world. When I have
died, you must live
long, and the Middle Captain's keepsakes and my
lord's belongings—take out all these various things.
These are what I have been looking at lately for comfort,
but when I am gone,
this sorrowful world turns like a wheel, and
if you should meet them again, please return
everything to them." Saying this, she pressed these keepsake items
against her face and again wept in sorrow.

The attendant (suke) was lamenting and grieving, wondering what could be done about her mistress's condition. As her heart grew ever weaker, the princess said that she was tormented by the thought of how much her attendant would grieve if she were to die, and that this was all that weighed on her mind, with her heartache having nowhere to go. She pressed her sleeves against her face and sobbed with tears. The attendant, weeping and grieving without limit, said "Do not abandon me on any path." The princess spoke of her longing for the people of the capital, her yearning for her lord, and though she thought this was the way of a world that shifts and changes, she said that she still missed the Middle Captain (Chūjō) as well.

As the days and months pass by, she sadly thinks that this year too is about to come to an end. Being in similar circumstances, without letting each other know of their situations, the princess feels no desire whatsoever to continue living long in this world, and spends her days and nights lying down in sorrow. As a keepsake for after she is gone, she wrote this down:

When I recall the past,
it becomes even more painful—
this body that has suffered so,
how much longer
in this same sorrowful world
like the Ariso sea, shall I merely exist (and let it be known)?

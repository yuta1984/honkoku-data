【Beginning of the story】
Among the retainers of
Hangan Tokikane, the great lord
of Kagamiyama in Ōmi Province,
which belongs to the Ashikaga
shogunate, there was a young man
named Shingon Mokujirou.
This Mokujirou, in his youthful folly,
had formed a romantic attachment
to a woman in the inner quarters.
One night, when he tried to sneak
into the garden at the entrance to her chambers,
Kawakura no Shin, who was in charge
of securing the inner palace,
encountered him in the darkness without knowing who he was
and cried "Hey, thief!" Since there was
no other choice, he captured both Mokujirou and Kura no Shin,
but now with no way out,
even when trying to let them escape, the matter had already
reached not only the senior retainers but
even the master's ears. Therefore, inevitably
he was condemned as a thief
and was already determined to be led
to the execution ground to be punished.
At this time, a man named Ibara Tenzen,
wishing to test his lord's character,
volunteered for the role
of executioner.
From evening he went
to the execution ground
and while waiting for the time
to cut off the head,
the sky suddenly became overcast,
heavy rain fell in torrents,
thunder and lightning struck,
and one could no longer
see the color
of anything at all.
The natural
time of execution

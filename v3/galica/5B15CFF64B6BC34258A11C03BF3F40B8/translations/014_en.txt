【Continuation】
On a rough mat,
Mokujirou was laid down, and with a cry of "Ei!"
a sword seemed to flash,
but a retainer nearby
cut off a head and
untied Mokujirou's
bonds, whispered something,
gave him plenty of gold
from his pocket, and
let him escape. Why
did he help him? There was
a hidden motive in Tenzen's
heart that would become clear later.
Thus, on this night,
no one at all knew
that Mokujirou had been saved.

○Here, Lord Ashikaga was a
refined gentleman who especially
loved rare objects. Now,
the Kagamiyama family secretly treasured
a parrot-shaped incense burner
that had long ago been
sent to this country from
a prince of Baekje Kingdom. For certain reasons,
it had been passed down in the Kagamiyama family.
Since Lord Ashikaga had long
desired it, Kawakura no Shin
undertook the role of messenger
and set out for the capital
carrying that parrot
incense burner.

At that time, it was late May,
and due to the continuing seasonal rains,
the Yasukawa River's
water level had risen, cutting off
travelers' passage. However, since Kura no Shin had
an urgent matter for his lord
with a set deadline, he found it
frustrating to wait for the water level to recede.
Moreover, being a vigorous
old man who had long been
skilled in horsemanship, he
tightened his horse's
girth and rode into
the surging Yasukawa River. Just as he was about
to reach the opposite shore,
his horse suddenly panicked,
threw Kura no Shin off, and
he was swept downstream.
While Kura no Shin was swimming,
someone unknown dove underwater
and stabbed through
Kura no Shin's side,
stole the parrot
incense burner from
his pocket, and
disappeared. His accompanying
retainers showed their devotion by pursuing,
so Jirou was shocked and
hurried to that place,
but there was no
evidence of who
the enemy was.
He could do nothing but push
his father Kura no Shin's lifeless
corpse and weep. Now
when this matter was reported
to Lord Ashikaga,

and furthermore,
his son Jirou was
ordered to investigate
the thieves.

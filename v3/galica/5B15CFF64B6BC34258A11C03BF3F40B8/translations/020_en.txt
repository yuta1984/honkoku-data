《Small print: Miraculous medicine for the face》Beautiful Fairy Fragrance (Bien Senjokō) - One packet: 48 mon

This medicine is a miraculous formula for facial treatment that a Qing dynasty Chinese person named Ifukyū, the owner of the 21st ship, gave to the courtesan Kikuno of Ōmiya in the Maruyama district when he was staying in Nagasaki in the 11th year of Kyōhō (1726). According to tradition, in the Qing dynasty (present-day China), court ladies constantly used this medicine to adorn their makeup.

This transmitted formula came to be passed down to my house for certain reasons, and I now spread it to the world. Today there are many medicines called facial medicines in the world, and though their colors all appear like chrysanthemums touched by early frost that deceive the eye, my house's miraculous medicine is a special kind of extraordinary remedy, so please do not regard it as being on the same level as ordinary facial medicines of the world.

The efficacy is recorded below.

When the matter was directly mentioned to the master of the servants across the way, they said he also wished to meet, so they would act as go-between. "Please write a love letter," they said, and the wet nurse, devoted to her master's single-minded love, went to Tokijirō's place - truly admirable behavior.

Now, Urazato's wet nurse Okane met with Somegorō, handed over Urazato's letter, and expressed her heart's feelings. Somegorō, pitying the anguish in her heart, immediately told Tokijirō of this matter.

Tokijirō became greatly angry, saying, "Though I am a man of great ambitions, do you think I should become involved in such frivolous matters and earn the scorn of society? Even looking at this letter is defiling!" When he scolded harshly, Somegorō scratched his head and said, "Master, to think of things without discrimination in such a single-minded way - might that not be called obstinacy? That girl's parent runs a well-known tool shop, so this could serve as a clue in searching for the lost incense burner. In ancient times, there was even the example of young Ushiwaka, who fell in love with Jōruri Gozen and gathered conspirators for revenge." With such skillful and varied persuasion, Tokijirō finally consented.

When he opened the letter that had been sent, the beauty of the brushwork and the refinement of the literary style made his heart flutter somewhat. Seeing Tokijirō's smile, Somegorō offered him paper and inkstone, and he wrote a reply in masculine script with flowing strokes. Somegorō took it and beckoned to the wet nurse across the way to hand it over, and the wet nurse was overjoyed.

When she showed Tokijirō's letter, the girl immediately became cheerful, her complexion glowing. A good medicine that works faster than Giba's secret miraculous remedies would surely be a favorable reply letter.

Now, one day Matsuya Suigetsu was summoned to Higashiyama-dono and it was decided that tonight would run late, so the wet nurse thought this fortunate and arranged with her counterpart the plan for their masters to meet secretly, waiting for nightfall.

○As the cold returned and spring went unnoticed, with the falling snow accumulating, Urazato waited anxiously, moving the bedroom light away, opening her bedding (not rush mats but proper night quilts), and waiting.

"Perhaps his heart has changed - why is my lord so late?" she wondered, sleeping and waking, sleeping again, even her pillow seeming empty, the oil not running out being hateful, counting the striking of the time bell on her fingers, with nothing to do but sigh.

Most Ainu boats are dugout canoes. They are made by carving large trees. There are also boats made by binding planks together with rope. There are boats for two people and boats for three people. One person has the duty of bailing water, and if they don't bail continuously, water will enter and the boat will sink.

This illustration shows a dugout canoe. The illustration of rope-bound boats is omitted here.

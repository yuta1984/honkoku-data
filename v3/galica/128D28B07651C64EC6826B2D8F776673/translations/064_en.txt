This is because no wise men have emerged in that country to provide instruction. Now, if we consider the origins of each nation, Japan, China, Korea, and Holland have all become civilized countries today, but at the time of creation they were all like the present-day Ezo. It was because great wise men emerged successively and provided unremitting education and cultivation over thousands of years that each became a civilized country. If a person of great wisdom were to emerge among the Ezo and provide education, they would gradually develop without doubt. However, perhaps because their country is thoroughly a backward nation with blocked fortune, no wise men have been heard of since the beginning of creation. Since no person of sacred wisdom is likely to emerge even in this degenerate age, neighboring countries should provide education for their salvation, making them understand human morality and develop their natural products to sustain their livelihood. This would accord with the principles of Shinto, Buddhism, and Confucianism. Particularly, the Ezo are close in territory and, moreover, revere and trust Japan.

This Ainu woman is shown in refined attire.
All women tattoo grass flowers or broken lattice patterns on their faces. They lightly tattoo their lips to make them blue in color.

The textiles of these garments are also not from their own country.
They are all textiles from Japan, China, and other places.
The sash is made of hitskoki (bark fiber) and tied in front. Those of lower status use wisteria rope and such.

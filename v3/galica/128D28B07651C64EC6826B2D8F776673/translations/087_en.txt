This is the clothing of 
Ainu men

This is a Chinese product that comes to Ezo via Manchuria and Karafuto (Sakhalin). What is commonly called "Ezo brocade" is precisely this.

They wear it with the cuff turned back four or five sun. This is called "horse leg" (maakiya).
This is a Tatar custom, and even present-day China uses this same style.

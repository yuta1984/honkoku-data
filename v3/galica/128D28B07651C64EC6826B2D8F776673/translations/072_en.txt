Armor (yoroi) is called "yokebe." It is made of three layers of leather sewn together, with a length of 2 shaku 2 sun. The width is 3 shaku 4 sun at the top and 6 shaku at the bottom.
A helmet (kabuto) is called "konchi," and also "takarakushi."
Arm guards are made by using itaya wood like metal reinforcing strips and sewing them onto cotton fabric. Shin guards are made in the same manner.

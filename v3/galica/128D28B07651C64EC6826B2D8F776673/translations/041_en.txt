That country has no medicine. When there is illness, there is only prayer. However, it is unknown to what kind of god they pray. It is surmised that they probably pray to heaven. ○In my humble opinion, it is not that there is absolutely no medicine at all. It is said that they sometimes treat stomach aches and cuts using two medicines called Ikema and Eburiko. These two medicines are recorded in the section on products below.

That country has no cotton or silk fabrics. Their clothing is called "attushi," made by stripping the bark of vine-like plants and weaving it coarsely. The weave resembles matting, and the garment is hip-length with tubular sleeves. This is called "jittoku." This item alone is the native clothing of the Ezo. Besides this, they use animal hides. Also in recent years, they have been given second-hand clothes from our country as well as China, Manchuria, Muscovy (Russia), and other places to wear. Therefore, even within one household, fathers, sons, and brothers wear different styles of clothing.

I have heard this to be so. There are also fourteen naval bases where they conduct naval combat training during peacetime. How much more so for the land forces. These matters are like the common saying "after rain, the ground becomes firm."

At Busan Port there is a Tsushima garrison, where several hundred soldiers are regularly stationed, sent from Tsushima domain. These things are probably places where they show deference to Japan.

The currency commonly used in that country is called Sangpyeong Tongbo《ten small coins equivalent to one》.

That country completely follows the Qing calendar system, but in correspondence with Japan, they refrain from using Qing era names, and simply write the cyclical signs and "such-and-such month." This too is probably a place where they show deference to Japan.

The people of that country are generally larger in stature than people from Japan, China, and other places, and their physique is also stronger. As for food consumption, generally the amount that two Japanese would eat should suffice for one Korean.

Ezo　　A country map is made separately on one sheet and attached to this volume

That country is located north of Ōshū, separated only by a single stretch of seawater from places like Tappizaki in Tsugaru and Ōmagatake in Nanbu.

That country extends from approximately forty-three degrees to fifty-one or fifty-two degrees latitude and is a region of severe cold. Generally speaking, it is a country about three hundred ri from north to south and about one hundred ri from east to west in Japanese measurements. However, the east-west dimension is irregular with curves and varying widths; at places like Ishikari and Iburi, it narrows to merely twenty-four or twenty-five ri.

The land of Ezo island is divided into five parts (note: the seventy ri territory of Matsumae is outside these five parts).

○From Haraki to Kiitapu, the direct distance (sashiwatashi) of one hundred seventy to eighty Japanese ri is called the Eastern part. There are fifty-one settlements (note: The Eastern part is called Menashkur in Ezo language. Menashi means east, and kur is like saying tribe or clan).

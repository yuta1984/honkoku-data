This is doubtful. The Shiribeshi of Ezo is more than seventy ri inland from Matsumae. If the court of Emperor Saimei had brought the Ezo under control to the extent of establishing a government office in this land, then in the present age, everything from Soya to Karafuto (Sakhalin) should have become Japanese people. However, west of Kumaishi and east of Shiokubi, everything remains Ezo in appearance and with foreign language. This is increasingly doubtful. One should examine the context of the preceding and following passages. I secretly suspect that [the chronicler] understood Tsugaru-yama as Shiribeshi. This is greatly mistaken. Furthermore, I consider that more than one hundred years after Emperor Saimei's reign, during the Tempyo-hoji era, a stele was erected at Tagajo in Miyagi district, inscribed with "120 ri from the Ezo national border." This is also increasingly doubtful. I await future scholars {{marginal note: The differences in the Ezo national borders between ancient and modern times, near and far, are discussed in detail in the section on the Tsubo stele}}.

The Ezo are also people of the same kind. However, their country has not developed culturally, and even to this day remains as it was at the time of creation, lacking currency, grain and textiles, writing, ceremonial clothing, calendar systems, etc., knowing only the pursuit of food and the affairs of sexual union between men and women—truly primitive indeed.

Regarding calendar systems: According to one person's explanation, they have a calendar system, setting the month of kenshi (eleventh month) as the first month and the month of kengai (tenth month) as the twelfth month. Moreover, they have dialectal names for the twelve months that differ from our country's terminology, he said. In my opinion, this is a European calendar system. That the Ezo people use this calendar system is something to be wondered at and feared.

(People call this Kamsaska). This is also a continuation of Tartar territory that wraps around the north of Ezo country and extends eastward to distant lands. Around the Kanbun era in Japan, the Empress of Muscovy in Europe was a great hero who raised her ambition to become the sole emperor of the five continents of the world.

She established institutions and issued decrees saying: "From myself onward, through all future generations of children and grandchildren, do not change my system. Make it the imperial enterprise to expand territory and achieve great accomplishments." From then on, day by day and month by month, she promoted talented people and gradually conquered the northern borders of Tartary, until finally by Japan's Genbun era, she made the eastern limit up to the cape of Kamshikatsutoka (that is, Kamsaska) - a distance of over 3,000 ri from Japan - into Muscovian territory, placing governors from that country to administer state affairs. However, that land has no grain or silk textiles, and its tribute consists of taking one animal hide per person.

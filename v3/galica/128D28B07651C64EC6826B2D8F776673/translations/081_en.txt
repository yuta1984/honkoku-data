Among the lower-class Ainu women, there are some who breastfeed bear cubs.

They raise eagles and Blakiston's fish owls to obtain feathers for arrows.

Ainu houses are all single-room constructions. They use buried posts and bind them firmly with vines such as wisteria. In their land, there are no saws or axes. Therefore, even houses of the upper class are all built in this manner.

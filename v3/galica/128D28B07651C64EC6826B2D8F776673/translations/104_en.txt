conducting business, and that ship was sailed around to Izu Province. With Nagasaki residents Shimatani Ichizaemon, Nakao Shōzaemon, and Shimatani Tarōzaemon (these three men were learned and knowledgeable in astronomy and geography) and Hachibei, a carpenter from Koami-chō in Edo, serving as leaders, a total of over thirty people received an official banner and departed from Shimoda in Izu on the fifth day of the intercalary fourth month of the same year. They first went to Hachijō Island, then gradually explored the ocean to the southeast, finally identifying over eighty islands. They conducted detailed surveys of the size of the islands, their latitudes, vegetation, and products, and returned to Shimoda in Izu on the twentieth day of the sixth month of the same year. What is recorded here is based on the records of the Shimatani family. ○In my opinion, the records of the Shimatani family do not mention the Kurosegawa. The Kurosegawa is located between Miyake Island and Hachijō Island, with a width of over twenty chō and extending one hundred ri from east to west as a great rapid current.

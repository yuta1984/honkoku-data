This is based on the records of the Tani family, with no private speculation whatsoever.

The distances of sea and land routes of the three countries are all recorded using our country's road measurement system of thirty-six chō to one ri. I do not use the road measurement systems of foreign countries. This is so that people of our country can easily understand them.

Korea follows the Qing system, using about three and a half chō of our country as one ri. One should know that ten ri of Korea equals one ri of our country. Ryukyu uses the same system as our country, with thirty-six chō to one ri. Ezo is said to consider forty-nine chō of our country as one ri, but since that country has no cities, post stations, or inns from the beginning, there is no one who has measured and determined those distances, so the details cannot be known. What is recorded here is based on the accounts of sailors familiar with those waters, and should be understood as rough measurements.

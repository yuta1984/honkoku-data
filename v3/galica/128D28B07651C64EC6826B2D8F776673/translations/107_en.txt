island," he said. He further stated: "This island is uninhabited, but seeing that it has abundant vegetation, one cannot call it barren. If people were sent from Japan to make it into a provincial territory and cultivate grains and other products, there would be great profit since the sea distance is not far. For the Dutch to establish a trading post there, the sea is too distant and the country too small to justify the expense." I consider Feith's words to be correct. Therefore, I record this again here merely for reference. End of Brief Account of the Uninhabited Island.

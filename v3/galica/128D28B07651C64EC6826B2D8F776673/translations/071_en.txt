In Ezo country, there are neither kings nor daimyo. They simply form settlements village by village, and within each, an elderly person of proper family lineage and popular support becomes the village chief and deliberates on matters. This being so, there is no one who can be called the lord of Ezo country. Moreover, the nature of the Ezo people is extremely simple and extremely good, and I have heard that the entire population of that country yearns for the customs of the superior country (Japan) like orphans longing for their parents. Considering this, even if merchants and sailors were to enter that country and persuade the Ezo people to adopt the customs of the superior country and change their folk ways, publicly speaking, this might be equivalent to loyal service. Privately, since it would be like delivering ignorant people to salvation, for such a person it could be called a good deed. There are many stories about this country and things I have heard that I would like to record in this book, but I refrain from writing them out of consideration for taboos. The end.

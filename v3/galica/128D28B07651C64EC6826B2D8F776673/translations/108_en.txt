This "Illustrated Account of Three Countries" is not my attempt to discourse on economics, nor is it a frivolous dabbling in geographical studies. I merely wish to inform those who serve in military houses about the geography of our three neighboring countries. Though this may appear to be a diversion from martial arts, I secretly believe it could rather be called the profound essence of the military way. Readers should not regard this as a book on economics. In the same year, Hayashi Shihei himself states this single passage in the postscript.

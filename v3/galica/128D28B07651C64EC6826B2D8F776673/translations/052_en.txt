will surely fall ill. It is truly a divine beast. Cattle and horses exist in Matsumae territory but not in Ezochi. Among marine animals, there are sea otters, fur seals, sea lions, and seals. All should be treasured as rarities. Among birds, there are hawks, island kites (peregrine falcons), eagles, and large eagles. Therefore, they produce many arrow feathers of the highest quality.

Among fish, there are salmon and herring. These are major products of this land and serve as staple food for the Ainu people. In coastal areas where seawater and freshwater mix, salmon are produced in quantities unmatched by other regions. In the seventh and eighth months of the year, when salmon swim upstream, the river water becomes blocked by them and does not flow. Then people catch them barehanded in quantities like mountains. They smoke and dry them over fire to make preserved fish (namely dried salmon, karasake). There are also herring. Where these fish school, foam like snow floats on the water surface. They net and catch these also in quantities like mountains. They also make dried fish from them. These fish have eggs filling their bellies. They split them open and extract the roe to make kazunoko (namely herring roe).

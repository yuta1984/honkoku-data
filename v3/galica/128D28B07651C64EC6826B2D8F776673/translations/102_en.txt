In the ocean between Mikura Island and Hachijojima, there is a rapid current called Kurose River, which is considered a dangerous place by sailors. This can be understood by looking at the map.

Among the islands, large and small, there are a total of eighty-nine mountains. Of these, there are two large islands, four medium islands, and four small islands. These ten islands have extensive land with abundant vegetation and flat areas in places where people can reside. The remaining seventy-odd islands are small rocky islets with steep terrain, so people cannot live on them, but products can be gathered there.

Since these islands are in the warm region of twenty-seven degrees, even in mountain peaks and valleys, soybeans, wheat, millet, barnyard grass, sweet potatoes, and other crops can be planted. Also, Chinese tallow trees (Nankin-haze) can be planted to obtain wax. Moreover, rare delicacies can be obtained through fishing and hunting.

The vegetation and various products found on these islands are recorded below. However, there are no wild animals at all.

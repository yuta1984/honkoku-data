Having barely regained consciousness, I managed to emerge from those treetops, but the valley below was still a sheer cliff of several hundred jin in depth, with no way to descend. However, since I had already fallen this far, climbing back up would be even more impossible. While I was wondering what to do, the tree branch I had been gripping for support loosened slightly from my hand. Once again I slid down over the snow, but from about halfway down, my head became inverted and I fell headfirst. While I had been caught in the treetops, Yōken had already fallen down ahead of me, so I fell on top of him. Fortunately, neither of us was injured. Since that spot had a little foothold, Yōken and I took each other's hands and looked up toward the heights above.

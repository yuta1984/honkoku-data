In any case, it appears that Japan has developed from the west.

Walking through snow at Budō-rei (Grape Ridge)

On the eighteenth day of the third month of Tenmei Hinoe-Uma (1786), I departed from a place called Hirabayashi in Echigo Province. In the early morning, a little snow was falling. From there, after traveling a bit over two ri, I arrived at the castle town of Murakami. At the transport station there, when I requested to borrow a horse from this point on, they said the snow ahead was deep and difficult for horses to walk through, so they would not provide a horse. Since it was the end of the third month, no matter how much of a snow country this might be, it shouldn't be so difficult for horses to walk. I suspected this was merely an excuse due to the inconvenience of providing horses and men, but there was nothing I could do about it.

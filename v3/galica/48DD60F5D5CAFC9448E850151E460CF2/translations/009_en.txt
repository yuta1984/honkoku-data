On the Tsubo no Ishibumi (Stone Monument of Tsubo)

The famous Tsubo no Ishibumi is located at the ancient site of Tagajō, northeast of Sendai in Ōshū. It stands along the road from Sendai to Matsushima, just two chō and forty ken off the main highway. A certain Matsui from the ink shop in Nanto erected a stone marker during the Kyōhō era, making it very easy to find. In ancient times, when the Ezo submitted to imperial rule, most of Ōshū was inhabited by people of that lineage, and during the period when they still frequently launched attacks, generals were dispatched from Kyoto to pacify them.

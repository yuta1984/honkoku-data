"Come on, let's go."
〽 (Okame) "Wait a moment. Look, fix up your appearance properly before we go." After tidying themselves up and setting off together, they walked along with Yohei, letting their feet take them where they would. Eventually they arrived at a certain farmer's house and knocked on the gate door, tap tap tap.
〽 (Yohei) "Excuse me, I have a small favor to ask," he said, and from inside came a hoarse voice.
〽 "Who is it?" came the uncertain reply.
〽 (Yohei) "It's Yohei.

Though it's late at night and I'm sorry to wake you, could you please open up here for just a moment?" In response to this request, when the gate opened, they saw an old woman approaching seventy years of age.
〽 (Old woman) "Oh my, who could it be? What an unexpected guest! I'm terribly sorry for not keeping in touch. What brings you here at this hour? Oh my, do you have a companion with you?"
〽 (Yohei) "Yes, I'm with a woman."
〽 (Old woman) "Oh, I see. At this hour. Well, come this way." At these words as their cue, both of them entered the house.

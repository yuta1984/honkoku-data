Okame:
〽 Yohei-san, what an unexpected
  marriage you're having! Please resign yourself to this
  unpredictable floating world and give up your feelings

Yohei:
〽 Listen here, Okame, when just last night we exchanged
  vows and made me feel so deeply,
  now suddenly you're getting
                    married—
  how frustrating!
    Only moonlit nights in darkness

〽 (Old woman) "Oh my, oh my, you must be so tired. This is just a country place, and on top of that it's late at night, so I have nothing to offer you. A proper meal will have to wait until tomorrow. There's still time before dawn breaks. Well now, both of you please get some rest." She brought out night robes and bedding and went into the back room. The two were left looking at each other's faces.
〽 (Yohei) "Oh my, oh my, finally I can calm down. Come, let's sleep." He spread out the bedding.

The two shared one night robe together, their obi sashes and hearts both relaxed, skin pressed closely against skin.
〽 (Yohei) "Unlike at Haranaka, here we can relax and it feels so good." Both of them breathless, they became cloud and rain, mortar and pestle, for as long as their loins could continue. In the bed where they could do as they pleased, they knew nothing of before or after and fell into a deep sleep. Early in the morning the old woman got up and began forcefully stoking the fire under the rice pot to prepare breakfast.

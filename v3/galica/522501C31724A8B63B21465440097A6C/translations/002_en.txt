From then on, the people returned to Ashihara-no-kuni (Japan), and moved to the mansion at Gojo. Furthermore, when the Middle Counselor presented the personally written imperial seal of the Bonten King (Brahma King) to the Emperor, His Majesty examined it carefully and, wishing to make it an example for Japan, removed his father, the Minister, from his official position. He then established what is called "Tenshi-no-miya" (Palace of the Son of Heaven) at Nishi-no-toin in Gojo, together with the personally written imperial seal of the Bonten King.

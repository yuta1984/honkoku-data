〽From evening without pulling out or pushing in
　Just keeping it inserted, and finally now
　It seems the night is about to break

In the long autumn nights
Only the nights I meet my beloved
Feel so short, from this moonlit night
How lonely and sad this moon is
"Don't make me say it, my dear," and the dawn bell tolls

〽I haven't had enough pleasure yet
So do it five or six more times
　　　　please
Even if night breaks into dawn
Wouldn't that be fine?

Due to such blind devotion, retribution came upon Komachi's body, and eventually her own being was no longer at peace.

【Poem within the illustration】
The wind blows and the road too shall be impassable
On this snowy midnight, not coming

With sake as my companion
The resentment that accumulates
in my heart
during this evening hour
These feelings
that I've suppressed
make for a pleasant intoxication

Feeling utterly ashamed, the Chūjō (Middle Captain) went to his father, the Minister, at dawn in a dazed state. When he brought out and revealed what had happened the evening before, the Kitanokata (Minister's wife) looked at it and said, "The Minister surely does not know about this. Could this be the doing of that other Kitanokata? Surely not. Well then, whoever orchestrated such a thing is truly detestable. Very well, don't make a sound," and spoke in secret. The Chūjō, feeling that the world was fleeting and meaningless, withdrew to his own quarters and hardly ventured out. When he opened the blinds that had been let down with a rattling sound at his former residence, spider webs hung unsightly, no one came to visit, and only dust and dirt had accumulated, making it desolate.

《Marginal note: Earth Fiend Star, one of seventy-two members, Earth Ugly Star》General Shi, Shi Yong

This man was from Daming Prefecture in Beijing. He made his living through gambling, sometimes wearing brocade during the day for pleasure, other times sleeping at night wrapped in rags. His character was extremely strong and brave, and when confronting enemies, he was like breaking a sake bottle with a stone. Therefore he was nicknamed General Shi. One year, when winter was already ending and the next day would mark the beginning of the new year, anxious to win at gambling so he could welcome spring even with just the clothes on his back, he went to a gambling den called Shaluocu. When things didn't go as he hoped despite his determination to win at all costs, in his anger he struck down with his stone fist, but instead of the dice showing a good face, his opponent's eyes popped out from his face, and just as the man was about to collapse helplessly, while everyone present was making a commotion, he grabbed the money and fled his hometown. He made his way to Yuncheng County, carrying a letter from Song Qing to seek out Lord Song, but on the way he quarreled with Yan Shun, which was mediated by Jiyu Rain, and here he began to form his sense of righteousness, making his威 felt throughout the Song dynasty.

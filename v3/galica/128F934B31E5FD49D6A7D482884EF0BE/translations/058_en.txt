　The Resourceful Star Wu Yong
At Huangni Ridge, he sells dates to make others thirsty while he drinks his fill from the stolen spring. At the Lu family house, he practices divination and explains how his Eight Trigrams clearly reveal the truth about Gao Qiu's poisonous army. The false priest at the Western Peak Temple waves the five-colored ritual streamers of the Nine Heavens Mysterious Lady as an omen against the Chaotic Heaven Formation. Even Ling Zhen's stone cannons - how could they possibly match the thorough strategems of this master of wisdom?

《Interlinear note: Earth Bandit Star among the seventy-two Earth Fiend Stars》Flea on a Drum Shi Qian

This individual was from Gaotang Prefecture. He ruined himself with alcohol and gambling, fell into poverty and came to Suzhou, where he frequently received kindness from Yang Xiong. He had originally mastered extraordinary arts, able to leap across eaves and run along walls. On the very day he was secretly breaking into graves at Cuiping Mountain searching for silver vessels, he encountered the scene where Yang Xiong angrily killed his wife on this mountain. He fled together with the two heroes Yang Xiong and Shi Xiu, lodged at the Zhu family manor, and in his drunkenness stole and ate chickens. This incident stirred up trouble and he became a prisoner, but was rescued by Song Jiang and others, and now lives peacefully at the water stronghold. He ran along the beams of Xu Ning's house to steal his secretly treasured golden armor, and in the strategy for attacking the Northern Capital, on the bustling evening of the Lantern Festival with its flower lanterns, he burned down Cuiyun Tower in one blaze. He has been most essential in every battle, and his achievements are exceptionally great.

This man is from Zhending Prefecture. He is over eight feet tall and has the most outstanding eyes, so he is nicknamed "Jade Banner Pole" (Gyokubankan).

After injuring someone in a fist fight, he fled to another country. Halfway on his journey, he encountered his sworn friend Deng Fei. Both men of similar circumstances and identical aspirations, they made subordinates of the rogues there and the gamblers here, and practiced banditry for over a year on the peaks of Yinma Mountain. Finally, following Dai Zong's recommendation, he joined the 108 heroes to share their joys and sorrows, and tied the cords of a deputy general's helmet. When attacking the rebels of the Xia Kingdom, in an ambush under Xiling Bridge, he joined forces with the three Ruan brothers, captured Mao Di, one of the ten generals of Gaozhou Castle, and wielding his spear again in good order, pierced through from chest to back Tang Fengshi, who was called a fierce general.

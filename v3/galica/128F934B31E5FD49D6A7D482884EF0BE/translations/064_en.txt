Vegetable Garden Zhang Qing
Cutting down demons and spirits. More frightening than the nine-character method of the secret schools is the cross-shaped slope inn.
Travelers here are cut down by crossroad killing,
The four elements that guard life scatter:
The wind element rises scattering to the wine banners under the eaves, the fire element
circles around the bottom of the pot,
the earth element is shaved into
meat buns. And the water element
in the barrel, mixed with wine, will be
criticized by the people as watery. Will they fear
being numbed?

Such nonsense
is spoken. Though dharma words are
indeed unsuited
to such a
slaughterhouse,
from the vegetable garden
of the bright
temple,
those roots are pulled
and planted.

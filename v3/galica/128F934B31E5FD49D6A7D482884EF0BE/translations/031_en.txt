Leopard Head Lin Chong

Seeking swords and arrow feathers in the streets
cuts apart the harmonious bond of mandarin duck
couples.
The blade of righteousness wielded in the mountains
chooses its master and gleams sharply.
There is no path of escape
from the front gate of the White Tiger, but at the
rear gate of the Heavenly King, there is
a shrine for refuge. When one's heart
runs along the righteous path,
how could
demons and evil spirits
possibly
harm it?

In the battle of Fenyang, he captured the demon army's general Shenkuzi Maling as prisoner. Also, for his meritorious deeds in conquering Jiangnan, he received the teachings of a heavenly monk and captured the bandit leader Fang La in the deep valley of Bangyuan Cave. From this perspective, among the martial achievements of the 108 heroes, none surpassed this great monk.

The four seas were completely pacified. On the journey home after disbanding the army, he stayed one night at Liuhe Temple in Hangzhou. At midnight, when the sound of the tide on the river rang out, the monk was suddenly startled and asked a monk beside him, who answered that it was the sound of the tide. The monk smiled with joy and said, "The time of my rebirth in paradise has come." He spread out his sitting mat, donned his Buddhist robes, sat upright with palms together in prayer, and achieved Buddhahood as peacefully as if falling asleep.

The imperial court held him in great reverence and trust, and with ceremonies conducted by imperial messengers, he was posthumously honored with the title of Great Zen Master Yilie Zhaoqi.

《Interlinear note: Earth Depletion Star among the seventy-two Earth Fiend Stars》White Day Rat Bai Sheng

This individual operated a wine business and gambling den in the impoverished village called Anle Village, east of Yellow Clay Ridge. Having previously received favors from Chao Gai, he joined the group plotting to steal Liang Zhongshu's gifts. He also corresponded to the omen in Chao Gai's dream where a minor star transformed into white light. On the appointed day, his role involved carrying a load of wine with ladles, concealing gunpowder wrapped in a towel dyed deep blue with indigo, disguised as a sweat cloth, and while distracting with vulgar songs, he successfully stole one hundred thousand strings of cash. Before the money could even be distributed, he was bound hand and foot with ropes by He Qing, younger brother of the police commissioner, and imprisoned in the Eastern Capital's jail. However, he eventually escaped and came to Liangshan. The reason for this was that this man originally possessed strange arts—whether rat holes or knotholes, he had mastered the art of making his body thin to slip through them with extreme skill. "White Day Rat" was his nickname.

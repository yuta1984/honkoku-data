《Marginal note: Among the thirty-six members of the Tiangang Stars, the Tianhui Star》　Life-Risking Third Son Shi Xiu
This person was from Jinling, Jiankang Prefecture. When he saw the weak, he would shed tears and help them; when he encountered the strong, he would burn with anger and strike them down. For this, people gave him the nickname "Life-Risking Third Son." He broke his pots and burned his boats to leave his hometown, came to Suzhou and became increasingly destitute. While selling firewood below the city, he beat down Zhang Bao and dozens of others, removing Yang Xiong's troubles, became sworn brothers with him, and took temporary residence in his house. Hating the adultery at the memorial service, he killed the evil monk Ruhai and resolved Yang Xiong's confusion. After having the woman killed at Cuiping Mountain, he traveled the road together with Shi Qian as a group of three and fled to Liangshan Marsh. When the Zhu family's disaster arose, they received help from Song Gong and others. In Beijing, he leaped from wine towers to rescue Lu Junyi, and at Baoyan Temple, he burned the pagoda to attack and capture Suzhou City. His killing intent remained fierce and undiminished until the end of his life.

《Interlinear note: Tiangang Star, one of the thirty-six members, Tiantui Star》Winged Tiger Lei Heng

This individual was the son of an ironsmith from Huncheng County in Jizhou. He was seven feet five or six inches tall, with a complexion like purple sandalwood, and a beard resembling copper needles. Because he could leap across wide valleys, he was nicknamed "Winged Tiger." The county magistrate, recognizing his martial skills, appointed him to the position of infantry captain. One day, he went to see the singing and dancing of the idle man Li Xiaoer and the beauty Bai Xiuying. When Bai Yuqiao, Xiuying's father, criticized Lei Heng for having no money in his purse, he beat him. At this time, the county magistrate's deep affection for Xiuying was considerable, so borrowing his authority, Xiuying had Lei Heng sentenced to exile. The prison warden at that time was his close friend Zhu Tong, who took pity on him and untied his bonds along the way, allowing him to escape. Grateful for this kindness in his time of crisis, he carried his mother on his back and headed straight for Liangshan Marsh.

《Among the seventy-two members of the Earthly Fiends, the Earth Void Star》 Little Overlord Zhou Tong

This individual was from Hongzhou, but seized Peach Blossom Mountain in Qingzhou and became a bandit leader, styling himself the "Little Overlord." He wielded power there for six or seven years. One day, accompanied by Li Zhong, he invited them to the mountain stronghold and for the first time increased the fortress's strength tenfold. Rampaging freely through towns and villages alike, he attempted to force his way into marriage with the daughter of the Liu family in Peach Blossom Village, bringing many subordinates in a grand procession. On the night of the wedding feast, when the banquet was at its height and his spring desires were stirring, he raised the gold-embroidered curtains on both sides. But when he tried to enter—what was this? The beautiful woman transformed into a monk resembling a rakshasa demon, who instead converted him through preaching, causing him to abandon lust and embrace righteousness. Some years later, when Huyan Zhuo was fleeing in defeat and spent a cold night in a village at the foot of the mountain, Zhou Tong stole his fine horse Wuzhui, and from this great trouble arose. Though he was besieged at Qingzhou City, the three mountains joined their forces together, and with additional help from the water marsh, he took his place in the Hall of Loyalty and Righteousness.

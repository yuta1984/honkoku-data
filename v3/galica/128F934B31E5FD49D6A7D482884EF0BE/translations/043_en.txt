　　Winged Tiger Lei Heng

Because rumors of bandits were frequently heard, he received orders from the magistrate of Yuncheng County and came searching to the ridge above Dongxi Village. The maple leaves had not yet turned red when he captured with ropes what he believed to be bandits from the greenwood. He bound a large man resembling a red bear in front of the curtains at Lingguan Temple, but this was at Chao Gai's house. Though his innocence was explained and the ropes on his limbs were untied, anger remained deeply pent up in his heart. Determined to retaliate painfully somehow, he pursued for one or two li to the base of a tree, where with a great shout he drew his sword - this was to settle the grudge from being initially bound with ropes. The voice of a wild tiger roaring as it receives and deflects the sword of a red demon shooting flames, the sound of the blade cutting through air, seemed to reach the heavens a thousand li away. The Resourceful Star (Wu Yong) comes here to calm the blade.

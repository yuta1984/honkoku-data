These brothers were hunters outside Dengzhou city. Both were tall, over seven feet in height, and possessed strength superior to others, so they lived by hunting day and night. When passing by a cliff, they encountered a wounded tiger. They shot the tiger down into Mao Zhongyi's estate. When the brothers went to his house to retrieve it, the father and son of the Mao family were ill-hearted. They would not return the tiger but instead deceived them, tricked and captured them, bound them with rope, and threw them into the official prison. The couple Sun Xin and his wife took pity on them, joined hearts with several heroes, and finally rescued them from prison. Immediately they stormed into the Mao household, slaughtered everyone in the family starting with the poisonous father and evil son, seized gold, silver, swords and horses, and joined the army at Zengtou Market where Song Gongming had deployed. The elder brother Xie Zhen took the head of the third son Zeng Suo as his first achievement. When pursuing the army of the traitorous official Tong Guan, they tormented Fang Mei and Bi Sheng, and destroyed Gao Qiu's sea loach ships.

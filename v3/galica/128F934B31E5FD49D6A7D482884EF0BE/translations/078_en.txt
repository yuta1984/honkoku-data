Since then, his exploits on the rivers and lakes included: starting with Huang Wenbing, welcoming An Daoquan, fighting the bandit Zhang Wang on the Yangtze River, and the evil Gao Qiu of the sea loach ships. At Jinshan Temple Harbor he killed Wu Cheng, and seizing the Chen family's boat, he achieved the greatest merit in the attack on Runzhou. In the battle at Hangzhou city, he alone leaped from Xiling Bridge, diving right and emerging left through layers of bell ropes and gong nets, climbing up to Yongjin Gate. When the sound of him trying to scale the high walls was detected by the guard soldiers, he was shot down by thousands of archers. Though he escaped deep into the water bottom, having not even an inch of iron as shield on his body, this vigorous hero, pitiful as it was, ended up turning into bubbles on West Lake. However, his fierce soul was not in vain - receiving the benevolence of the Dragon Emperor, he obtained the position of Jinhua Daibao and borrowed his brother Zhang Heng's body. His killing in anger of Fang Tianding, who was the castle lord under Mount Wuyun, was truly the utmost expression of loyalty and righteousness.

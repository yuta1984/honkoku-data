《Side note: Among the thirty-six members of the Heavenly Gang Stars - Heavenly Swift Star》Divine Traveler Dai Zong

This person is a jailer supervisor in Jiangzhou. The nickname "Divine Traveler" comes from the fact that when there are urgent public or private matters, he ties two jia-ma (magical talismans) to his thighs and uses the divine traveling technique to run from the hour of the rabbit to the hour of the rooster covering five hundred li, and when using four jia-ma, he has the leg power to cover eight hundred li - this is known to everyone. When the exiled Song Gongming's regular money scattered from the coin holes and he first began his association with the water margin heroes, while traveling as a courier to the Eastern Capital, he met Wu Yong and returned to Jiangzhou with a forged reply to help Song Gongming. However, due to a single oversight among a thousand considerations, the secret leaked from the seal and was discovered by Huang Wenbing. Just when both Song Gongming and he were about to lose their heads at the execution ground, Chao Gai, Wu Yong and others rescued them from the crisis, and they escaped certain death to find safety in the water marsh. Not only does he have the merit of delivering messages on foot, but his acts of using wisdom to rescue righteous friends and help heroic companions know no bounds in all four directions.

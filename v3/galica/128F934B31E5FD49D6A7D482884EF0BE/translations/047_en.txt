Living King of Hell - Ruan Xiao Qi (Ruan Xiaoqi)
Faced with the emptiness of last night's nets that were pulled up in vain, he had no choice but to pawn his only straw raincoat to pay for the wine he preferred over three meals a day. How hateful this morning's boat is! Soaked through by rain at the water's edge, with no spare clothes in his chest. He warms his cold shoulders and waist by a fire made from a handful of reeds.

Short-lived Second Son - Ruan Xiao Wu (Ruan Xiaowu)
Rather than the mesh of the fishing nets he constantly weaves, he pursues the "five" dots of his own name, and at times boldly stakes a thousand gold pieces in a single throw. His home lacks even four walls, and knowing neither wealth nor poverty - this is the normal state of a heroic man.

Black Whirlwind Li Kui
When Song Gong was about to entertain Dai Zong and sought fresh fish in front of Pipa Tower, Li Kui became angry and severely beat Zhang Shun with seven or eight punches. Those fists were difficult to oppose, so using cunning to defeat Li Kui, he rowed a boat out onto the lake. Seeing Li Kui chase after him wanting to pull out the tongue that had pointed and cursed at him, Zhang Shun thought "Got him!" and jumped into the water, dragging Li Kui into the waves.

Zhang Shun's body was whiter than snow, while Li Kui was even blacker than ink. The way they bobbed up and down was like a foolish crow imitating a cormorant being harassed by a heron. Finally their mutual enmity was resolved, and they exchanged brotherly cups of water on the Xunyang River - this was truly the friendship of fish and water.

《Side note: Among the seventy-two members of the Earthly Fiend Stars - Earth Dark Star》Jinbao Zi Yang Lin

This person is from Zhangde Prefecture. He has a round head, large ears, straight nose, square mouth, clear eyebrows, and beautiful eyes, truly resembling a jinbao zi (brocade leopard) in appearance, so it is reasonable that this became his nickname. Seeking to visit heroes from various regions, he traveled through martial arts and literature, and in the mountains of Suzhou received the teachings of Master Yiqing. Joyfully heading toward Liangshan Marsh, at the border of Yishui County, he found it strange to see the Divine Traveler running. Speaking together, their admiration for Song Gongming and others was like a magnetic needle pointing south. He arrived again at Gongsun Sheng's mountain. Midway on that journey, he lured out Deng Fei, Meng Kang and others from the mountain stronghold at Yinma River, and joining the righteous hall of the water marsh, when he displayed his courage on the sea loach ships, he took the living head of Qiu Yue of the Left Guard親軍 and demonstrated his military glory. He is a hero invincible before the battle formation.

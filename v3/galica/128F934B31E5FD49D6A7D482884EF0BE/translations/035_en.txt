《Marginal note: Tianmeng Star among the thirty-six members of the Tiangang Stars》　Thunderbolt Fire Qin Ming

This person was from Kaizhou in Shanhou, and his official position was Commander of Qingzhou Prefecture. His temperament was particularly hot-tempered, so he would fly into a rage even if chopsticks fell over. Since his voice resembled thunder, he was nicknamed "Thunderbolt Fire." He wielded his wolf-tooth club with great skill, and with one swing could pulverize and scatter hundreds of enemies.

Once, when his disciple Huang Xin suffered defeat at Clear Breeze Mountain, he became furious and attacked Clear Breeze Mountain so fiercely it was like cannon fire. Eventually he fell into a trap devised by Hua Rong and others, but with the enemy's help he returned once to the prefectural city. However, since the prefectural governor was originally stupid and wouldn't let him into the city, he lost his place of refuge. Furthermore, he was deeply moved by the profound righteousness of Song Gongming, Hua Rong and others. Moreover, when Hua Rong gave him his sister, he accepted her as his wife, settled peacefully at the water stronghold, and his righteous courage became ever more magnificent.

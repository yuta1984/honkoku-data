descended [into this world]. Those who rely on the Lord of Heaven even once according to my teaching, even if their sins are like mountains, [these sins] shall be extinguished, and the Lord grants them the joy of heaven. Nevertheless, there are shallow and deep levels in religious practice. Suffering and pleasure are likewise so. Together there are four levels of shallow and deep. First, those who turn to other sects and seek salvation in the afterlife cannot be born in that heaven and fall into Inferno (hell) in vain. This is because apart from Deus, there is no other lord of the world. Second, even though they turn to the Christian doctrine, those whose practice is not complete and who do not receive permission from the Lord of Heaven cannot directly be born in that heaven. First, those who remain in Purgatory and receive suffering are light [in their sins].

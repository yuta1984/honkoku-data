It is called "Tejuizo Zeraru" (the Last Judgment), which is also called "Universal Investigation." At the end of the kalpa, by the command of the Lord of Heaven, heaven and earth and all worlds will be burned away, and all sentient and non-sentient beings will be completely destroyed. After this, all people will be revived and return to their original forms. Those who are to be born in good places will shine with their own bodily light, while those who are to fall to evil places will stand with skin and bones connected. Thereafter, all will gather in the valley of Josatsu (Jehoshaphat) in the country of Judeyo (Judea). The Lord of Heaven will descend, lead the good people and seat them on the right, lead the evil people and seat them on the left, thus separating good from evil and determining light from heavy [sins]. The evil people will fall eternally into Inferuno (Hell) and receive suffering, while the good people will follow the Lord of Heaven, be born in Paradise, and receive pleasure. Long ago, Cristo (Christ) in Judeyo

They did not receive offerings [from the converts]. The vast amount of treasure they spent came entirely from their home country. Later on, they established a system where each disciple of the Nanban temple received daily one shō of rice and eight bu of silver per person, recorded in a large ledger. During this time, four scribes, eight people for dispensing medicine, and eight officials for distributing stipends worked from the first quarter of the hour of the Rabbit (around 6 AM) to the last quarter of the hour of the Cock (around 6 PM). These twenty people worked without rest in distributing [aid], so the disciples prospered day by day.

The propagation method of the new sect of the Nanban temple promised immediate Buddhahood in this very life, and people whispered to each other that the joy of ascending to heaven for eternity was beyond doubt. At this time, many people among both the court nobles and warrior families converted to this religion.

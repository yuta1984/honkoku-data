They gave them prayer beads with forty-two beads. The dhāraṇī text is:
　　"Haikōshōten-haraai　Zōuyūzen-shōmaro"
[They taught them:] "For seven days, generate no evil thoughts day or night, chant this mantra, pay respects to the two Padres, receive the sacred scriptures of the Heavenly Emperor, and worship the sacred image of the Heavenly Emperor. Then the future sins and karma reflected in today's mirror will be extinguished, and you will receive the great compassion of the Heavenly Emperor." Thus instructed, everyone chanted the mantra in unison, concentrated their faith for one full week (seven days), and recited the mantra day and night. The deception by which the two Padres and two Irmãos deceived the ignorant masses and led them into heretical practices consisted of such expedient means. 《Marginal note: Later, during the siege of Amakusa Hara Castle in the 15th year of Kan'ei, when the castle was already in mortal danger, there was a mantra that everyone in the castle chanted in unison》Santa Maria

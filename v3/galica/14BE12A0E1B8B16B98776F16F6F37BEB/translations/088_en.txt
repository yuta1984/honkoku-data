and thus he was a human being. Being human, how could he possibly save people? Moreover, when it is said that Shakyamuni made five hundred vows, these are vows made toward the Lord God Deus. Now, regarding vows - the reason there is a person who makes vows is because there exists a Lord who receives those vows. If there were no heavenly Lord to receive them, how could there be vows to be made? People of the world do not understand this principle. They should think deeply about this. What use is there in upholding sutras? In heaven, apart from Paradise, there is no other place of peace and bliss. What kind of Pure Land of Tranquil Light could there be? Those who take nenbutsu as their doctrine rely on Amida Buddha, chant the sacred name with their mouths, and through this merit desire to be born in the Western Pure Land.

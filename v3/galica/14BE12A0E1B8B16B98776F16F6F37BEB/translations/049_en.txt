saying this, he preached extensively about the doctrines of the Heavenly Emperor, exhausting his eloquence. However, this mother was a firm believer in the Nembutsu sect, and the preaching of other sects did not enter her ears. She said to Baian: "Your kind preaching and instruction are most appreciated. However, we have been followers of the Nembutsu sect for generations, and although there are many sects throughout the realm today, we do not listen to the doctrines of other sects. We rely solely on Amida's vow, and with the feeling that we have already achieved Buddhahood and enlightenment in this present world, we know of no other matters in Buddhism. Therefore, while your instruction is gratefully received, we absolutely cannot abandon Amida's vow at this point." Thus, she did not accept Baian's teaching. Originally, Baian intended to draw this mother into the sect through benefits, thinking that if the mother submitted, the Shuri-dayū would also easily convert.

[This teaching] translates as "arising and perishing." First, [God] created numerous angels (anjo) to serve constantly in attendance. Among them was a chief called Lucifer. His possession of all virtues and attainment of sovereignty was the same as Deus. Next, [God] created heaven and earth, and all phenomena in the universe. What was this method? With a single utterance of "Fiat," [God] created all worlds. When Deus raises the single thought of creation, then all things come into being. After this, [God] took pure soil and created a male child, naming him Adam. [God] made Adam sleep for three hours, took one bone from his right side, and using it as a foundation, created a woman, naming her Eve. Making these two husband and wife, [God] made them dwell in the land of Terrestrial [Paradise].

The wind rustled, a shower of rain passed over, and the leaves of the plants and trees in the garden glittered. In that eerily cold (mono-susamashiki) moment, from among the densely planted trees, a strange being appeared. A woman in white robes with disheveled hair and a suffering countenance stood in the garden. Both those behind the bamboo blinds and the outer retainers said: "This is improper entertainment; it cannot serve as pleasant diversion for His Lordship."

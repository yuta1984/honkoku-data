Prior to this, on the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month, the Sumiyoshi Shrine in Settsu Province experienced tremors and sixty-six pine trees fell down, which the head priest Settsu no Kami Sanmi Kunimune reported to the court. The court held deliberations and concluded that while the falling of pine trees was not particularly unusual, the fact that the number was limited to exactly sixty-six trees corresponded to the number of provinces in Japan (sixty-six provinces) and should be considered an ill omen, so they ordered temples and shrines to conduct prayers. This would likely be a portent that such a foreigner would come and spread heretical teachings, causing harm to the people. Thus the foreigner arrived at the castle town of Azuchi in Ōmi Province, entered a temple called Myōhōji where he rested for three days, and on the third day of the ninth month was summoned to the castle where Nobunaga granted him an audience. The Urugan Hateren wore something called an "aito" on his body.

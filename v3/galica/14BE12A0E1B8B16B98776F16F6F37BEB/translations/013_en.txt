ri, when viewed with a map of the world, it is a country located to the west of China and Japan. However, the reason it is called "Nanban" (Southern Barbarians) is that this country's dependencies—Macau, Luzon, and others—are located to the south of Japan. Hence they may be called Southern Barbarians. Macau, Luzon, and others are 800 ri in distance from Japan, and are particularly located south of Japan. They are not neighboring countries of Hispania, but rather its dependencies. Since Macau, Luzon, and other places are islands without governors, Southern Barbarian people frequently anchor their ships at these islands, and now many Southern Barbarians reside there, so they are said to be affiliated countries. There is a country called Inglaterra neighboring Hispania, also known as Anglia or Inglya.

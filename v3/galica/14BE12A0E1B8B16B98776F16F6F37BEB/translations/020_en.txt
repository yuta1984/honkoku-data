They deeply engage in banditry and evil deeds, or sink into afflictions such as incurable diseases, and their wishes for future good destinations cannot be fulfilled. When one is poor, evil thoughts arise. Because evil thoughts arise, incurable diseases again torment the body. Therefore, while the illnesses of this life can be cured through our medical treatment, the incurable diseases of future lives cannot be healed. Though the impurity of the body can be washed away, the impurity of the heart cannot be cleansed even by the tides of the great ocean. However, even those who do no evil in this world but are tormented by disease and poverty are experiencing the results of evil karma from previous lives. Therefore, unless that previous karma is exhausted, one cannot escape from eternal sin. Each person should purify their heart—whether you can escape future evil connections or not, worship this mirror!"

came and stayed one night. The mother welcomed him and invited him in, gradually offering courtesies for the gifts he had sent, and the guest monk engaged in peaceful conversation throughout the night. Baian said: "Generally speaking, the current Buddhist teachings - whether of Shakyamuni or Amida - are Buddhist teachings that call ordinary people 'Buddha' upon knowing their own nature. Therefore, in these latter days, their religious authority has declined and their moral teachings have naturally disappeared, so that achieving Buddhahood through present-day Buddhism cannot be accomplished at all. The Buddhist teaching of the Heavenly Emperor is the Buddha who appeared at the beginning of chaos, and even now exists in the same essence as the sun and moon, with religious authority and moral virtue unchanged since the beginning of heaven and earth. I do not know which sect your religious affiliation belongs to, but if you wish for Buddhahood in the future afterlife, you should quickly convert and submit to the Nanban sect."

When one raises a single thought, taking peaks to make valleys, taking seas to make mountains - this is not difficult. Writing down this intention, [they] press a blood seal and submit it to the Ekirenshiya. This is translated as "temple" here. There is also a teaching that makes people raise aspirations. This is called Karasa. This is translated as "assistance" or "cooperation." When the national law prohibits this sect, people firm in their Hiitesu dedicate their heart entirely to the doctrine and cast away their life and body from the world. Some receive the suffering of hanging upside down, some meet the punishment of fierce fire. At such times, concentrating wholeheartedly on the Lord of Heaven (Tenshu) for even a moment, [they] receive rebuke and endure suffering. Then the Lord of Heaven takes their place, joining his power [with theirs] to receive the suffering. For this reason, that person's anguish [is alleviated].

I finally yielded to my two brothers' earnest persuasion and decided to purchase trading goods. When I examined my two brothers' household finances, the thousand pieces of gold I had previously given them as capital had completely vanished without a trace, and what was piled up in their homes was nothing but dust and dirt. Even so, this old man did not reproach their laziness in the slightest. At this time, fortunately, my business had already accumulated six thousand pieces of gold, so I took one thousand for myself, gave my two brothers another thousand pieces each, and buried the remaining three thousand in a corner of my house as preparation so that we would not panic when we returned if the trading venture proved unprofitable. The brothers each purchased goods according to their own judgment, bought a single ship, loaded it with merchandise, and set sail with favorable winds across the vast ocean.

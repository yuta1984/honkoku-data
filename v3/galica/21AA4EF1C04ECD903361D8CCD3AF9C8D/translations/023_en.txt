From that day forth, the emperor adhered to his evil oath, taking one daughter from among his retainers and common people each night to make her empress, and the next morning immediately having her executed by strangulation. Today one virgin would marry and become the emperor's consort, and tomorrow one empress would suffer the agony of death by strangulation. When the prime minister frequently remonstrated against these violent acts, the emperor became greatly enraged and issued a stern decree: "Hereafter, if anyone dares to remonstrate, I shall immediately separate their head from their body." The people, terrified by this unprecedented violence throughout history, had no respite for peace of mind. Here there would be one father who could not bear the grief and weeping after losing his beloved daughter, while there another would wonder whether he would lose his daughter today, or whether tomorrow an imperial edict would come summoning his beloved child.

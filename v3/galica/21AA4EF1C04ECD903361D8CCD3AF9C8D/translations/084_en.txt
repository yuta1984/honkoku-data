While such mysterious events continued to unfold, what was even more strange was that the two dogs he had brought here were already in his house, and they were extremely obedient as if they recognized the old man. The old man thought to himself, "Originally, we never kept dogs in our house. There should be no reason for dogs to be in the house," and wondered about this.

They are indeed your two brothers."

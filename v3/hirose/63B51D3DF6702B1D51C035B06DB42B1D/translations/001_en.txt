【Main text】
On the dawn of July 19th, first year of Genji (1864), a fire broke out around the area below Kawaramachi Nijo. At the same 4 o'clock hour, another fire broke out around Sakai-machi Gate. The fierce flames were intense and spread to various locations. On the same day, fires also broke out in Fushimi and around Yamazaki, with flames reaching Tenryu-ji Temple in Saga. In a short time, it appeared that all of central Kyoto was aflame, and the chaos in the city was indescribable. Men and women, young and old alike, fled in terror from the fierce flames, and there were reportedly injured people as well. It was truly an unprecedented great fire, so much so that not only the nearby areas but even places like Osaka were preparing to evacuate, wondering if the flames might reach them too. People could think of nothing but escape preparations and had no peace of mind due to this great fire. The fire was extinguished around 7:30 on the 21st of the same month.

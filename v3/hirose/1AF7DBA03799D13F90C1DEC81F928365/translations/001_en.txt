A young child
Being led by a cow,
Playing
Lightly and freely—
What a joyful
Sight to see.

The cowpox vaccination method is an incomparably good technique from ancient times to the present. Now it has spread even to remote frontier regions, and countless hundreds of millions of children have escaped the great calamity of epidemic smallpox and avoided untimely death. This can truly be called a benevolent medical art. However, even now there are not a few people who deeply doubt and refuse to trust it. Despite having such a benevolent technique available, it is truly lamentable that many children continue to be harmed each year whenever smallpox epidemics occur. If the general public were to come to trust this method, there would not be a single person who dies from smallpox. This is what I earnestly hope for.

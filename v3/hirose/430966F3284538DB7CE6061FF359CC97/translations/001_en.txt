〽This is terrible!
At this rate, I
won't be able to handle it
So, old man,
I'll tell the fire god
the same thing

Kashima (referring to Kashima Daimyōjin)

Everyone's gathering around
and bullying like that -
how pitiful!

By the water god's
divine message, our lives
were saved, and we
entered among
the six-tenths
who survived -
how joyful!
【A waka poem about being among the 60% who survived thanks to the water god's divine message】

〽From now on,
we'll keep a low profile

〽Oh my, oh my, this is
terrible that this remains

Craftsman
〽Now, now, gentlemen, don't
do such things - please
show patience
Otherwise we'll be

it's service with life only
Even so, oh dear, this is terrible
At this rate we'll be completely at a loss for gratitude

Great Earthquake in Kyoto, Osaka, and Fushimi

【Main text】
At the time of the 2nd day of the 7th month, from the 7th hour of midday (around 4 PM), the shaking began. In Kyoto, Osaka, and Fushimi, the capital area collapsed, and in the west and east Honganji districts, townhouses and storehouses throughout this entire area were crushed severely. The number of cattle and horses that lost their lives was countless.

During the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th days, about five or six times, the tremors were exceptionally strong. During those times, people carried tatami mats and doors out to the streets, and upon them, men and women both young and old prayed to gods and Buddha. Thanks to this, by dawn of the 4th day at the 7th hour, it finally calmed down, and from then on, heavy rain began to fall incessantly. Particularly in places like Fushimi, tremors continued for three days, causing men and women of all ages to feel strange apprehension. However, since this was entirely the land of the imperial capital, it settled down without defilement, so they say.

The old man's resilience withers,
we too at that time
wondered what
to do, but
with this
situation
it seems
things have
settled down
a bit,
but still
we don't know

Entertainer
Well, you
gentlemen, even in this crisis
you walk around
so grandly
and sell quite well,
so you can rest easy.
But for people of
our status, from now on
we'll truly be in trouble.
However, since the disturbance
is gradually becoming calmer,
next spring should be a good year-end.

Laborer
Ah, this is good sake, and this big catfish
kabayaki is exceptionally delicious! Once you know
this taste, you can't stop. But the boss said
such things don't happen often,
so let's eat our fill while we can.

Rickshaw puller
Well, this is
most grateful.
About this matter,
well then,
I want to
do this
quickly.
I'll ask for a
replacement
right away.

【Lower section】
If it continues
too long, the aftermath
will be bad, so
let's have a good
year-end quickly.

Warehouse keeper
Yes, is that you, sir?
Your order is ready.
My, we certainly
suffered greatly
in this earthquake.
Please come up
quickly.

Carpenter
Hey, hey, miss,
one more dish,
cook it quickly!
Once you've tasted this flavor
you can't stop.
And sake too,
hurry it up!

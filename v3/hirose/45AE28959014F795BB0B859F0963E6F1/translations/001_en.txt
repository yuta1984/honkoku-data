At that time, on the 7th day of the 8th month of Keio 2 (1866), Year of the Tiger,
from around half past the 4th hour of night, wind began to blow
from the southeast direction, gradually becoming a great storm,
and the shaking of heaven and earth was beyond words to describe.
The roofs of people's houses were all blown up and
blown off, making every house look like a birdcage.
Of course, the number of houses blown down was enormous.
In the upper areas, starting with Kamo and other mountains, and also the damage to shrines and temples was
extensive. Toji Temple suffered great damage with approximately eighty
trees knocked down. At Higashiyama's Gion, Chion-in, Kiyomizu, and other
temple precincts also suffered great damage, not to mention the various halls,
with approximately 380 large trees knocked down.
At Higashi Honganji Temple, the various halls had just been completed in construction, but were all
blown down, returning to the original wasteland, which is most
regrettable. Approximately 86 or 87 townhouses were knocked down, and the number of damaged houses was
　　　　　　countless. The dead numbered approximately 200 or more, and the injured were
　　　　　　also countless. The Katsura River flooded for more than three ri,
　　　　　　　　　　　looking like a vast sea, with people traveling by boat.
　　　　　　　　　　　Fushimi and Yodo experienced great floods and the great bridge fell.
　　　　　　　　　　　In Osaka, Tenjin Bridge and Ajikawa Bridge fell.
　　　　　　　　　　　Takatsuki and Ogura in southern Yamashiro
　　　　　　　　　　　were also severely devastated, truly
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　beyond the power of the brush to describe.
　　　　　　　　　　　　Truly this was an unprecedented great storm,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　something to be feared and
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　regarded with reverence.

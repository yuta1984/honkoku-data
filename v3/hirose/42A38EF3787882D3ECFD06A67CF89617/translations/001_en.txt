Kawari-ken (A Different View)

〽Indeed, how precarious this Shinshū earthquake and temple opening!
People swaying, bodies swaying back and forth, everything inside shaking loose
Everything has loosened up, what a predicament
Thinking the earthquake might have
crushed that old woman of Zenkōji Temple
We tried building an embankment, but realized
what a troublesome situation this is

Here, from around the fourth hour of the night on March 24th of Kōka 4 (1847), a great earthquake struck Shinshū Province. From Zenkōji Temple and the Kawanakajima area to the Tanbajima ferry crossing, and likewise the mountains across the river from Koichi collapsed and tumbled into the river, damming the water flow and causing it to overflow into people's homes. The damage to rice fields and farmland was considerable. However, only the main hall of Zenkōji Temple escaped destruction. Now, toward the Echigo route, around Kashiwabara barrier and Echigo Takada, and toward the Jōshū entrance, particularly around Oiwake, Kutsukake, Karuizawa, Komoro, and Iiyama the shaking was especially severe. To the south, from around Aida to Matsushiro and the Ueda vicinity, the Chikuma River was dammed up, and floods suddenly burst forth. The cries and screams of people and horses were unbearable to witness. The next day, around the sixth hour, things finally calmed down, and people felt relieved.

Earthquake Hyakumanben (Million Prayers)

First, this time I have troubled the various provinces for eight thousand years, and have repeatedly apologized to Kashima-sama. Now again I have violently shaken Great Edo, toppled houses and crushed many people. This time I am truly without excuse, so I will become a monk and set out on a pilgrimage through the various provinces. Also, at this time, a wealthy person who possesses priest's robes says that for everyone's request, since it is all for dancing anyway, please perform the hyakumanben (million prayers), so I will do so.

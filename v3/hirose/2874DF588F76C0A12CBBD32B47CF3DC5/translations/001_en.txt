By this rabbit year (the following year)
I have known them for thirty-two years
One: There are other branch families as well
　but we have no dealings with these (families)
Among the above, those who lost their homes and fell into ruin were
only the Wakasaya Jirosaemon brothers

　At the time of the above conflagration
One: Through the thoughtfulness of that person (the benefactor)
　as fire condolence gifts
One: Two gold ryo, cotton-padded cloth jacket  
One: Five to of white rice
One: One tub of miso
One: One tub of pickled vegetables
One: Ten Spanish mackerel
One: Sea bream and various other items totaling
　fifty-one bundles
One: Dried radish strips
　from Owari
One: One kan in weight, these too are
　truly excellent and
　useful items, so
　each time we use them
　we feel deeply grateful

and thankful
shedding tears of gratitude
as we use them, and also
for the condolence visits you gave us
we gave some to Ayatoku (possibly a nun's name) as well
and to other family members
a little bit each
everyone
rejoiced
and we will never
forget this kindness
At that time, when Teikyo was
also ill
One: You gave us much silver
　many times over
　so many grateful
　things, I believe
　there is no way to fully express our gratitude
　Among the seventeen houses
those who lost their homes and fell into ruin were
only the Wakasaya brothers
The others will be reported together later
Regarding receiving such care
first of all, not even one person
died in the fire
this is a truly grateful thing
One: For the souls of those with no connections
　Namo Amida Butsu
The fire victims in Satake were
numerous beyond count
this place seemed like a dream
Namo Amida Butsu
　　Teikyo (author of this letter, likely a nun)
To Zensaemon-sama
The condolences are understood
by conjecture

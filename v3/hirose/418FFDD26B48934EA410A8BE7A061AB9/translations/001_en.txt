"The Great Kantō Earthquake and Fires"

A person without consideration is not human. Upon hearing of the great earthquake and fires in Edo, how great must be the grief and sorrow of parents, siblings, and various relatives in distant provinces? To serve as assistance in informing people as quickly as possible of everyone's safety and survival, I record this in detail. The time was the night of the 2nd day of the 10th month of Ansei 2 (1855), past the fourth hour, with rain.

Near the Outer Palace: The residences of Sukegata Bingo-no-kami, Honjō Satsuma-no-kami, Honda Etchū-no-kami, and Sakai Ukyō were slightly damaged. The residence of Matsudaira Shimōsa-no-kami burned down. The auxiliary residence of Matsudaira Higo-no-kami burned down.

[The text continues with extensive details of damage throughout various districts of Edo, including Shiba, Asakusa, Ueno, Hongō, Kanda, and many other areas, listing specific daimyo residences, temples, bridges, and commercial districts that were damaged or destroyed.]

This was an unprecedented great earthquake. However, there was no particular damage within the castle. The damage throughout Edo's twenty-li radius was extraordinary. The aftershocks subsided on the third night. All people felt relief. How fortunate!

The government, out of compassion, built temporary shelters for the poor who were sleeping outdoors - nine and seventy-one huts at three locations: outside Saiwaibashi Gate, Fukagawa waterfront, Daiku-chō, and Asakusa Hirokōji. We are deeply grateful for His Lordship's benevolent virtue and grace.

Edo had 5,723 districts, and by the end, 113,280 storehouses were sealed, and shrines and temples were damaged.

On the 5th day, due to heavy rain, the ritual offering by the left and right jockeys took place at the sacred pavilion (go-sekiya), it is said.

《Marginal note: If there is rain on the 1st day, this is an example of postponing the ritual》【Red ink】
Kiyoshige further notes that since the 1st day of the 5th month is not a formal divine service, it can be seen in medieval times that if there was rain on the 1st day, it would be conducted on the 2nd day. The Oyonaga Records state: "1st day of 5th month, Bunmei 10 (1478): Rain fell, continuous rain. Today the Kamo ritual was postponed due to rain... 2nd day: Rain fell, occasionally clear. Due to yesterday's rain, there was no Kamo foot ritual. Today it took place... 5th day: Clear and cloudy, rain occasionally fell. Horse racing as usual."

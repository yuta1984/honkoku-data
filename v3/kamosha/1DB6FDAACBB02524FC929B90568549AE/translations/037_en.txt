"I shall go to hear the response, so please assign a deputy steward. Also, since your household has people who have dealings with Nijō-dono, there might be some private arrangements possible," he requested of the assembled people. However, since there were slight differences of opinion among them, and since there was no arrangement to assign a deputy steward early the next morning, in any case, whether or not to hold the horse racing would depend on the response to you. First, I have instructed all the officials about this matter," came the reply. During the night, Kazue-no-suke visited Suruga-no-suke-dono for consultation. When various private consultations were also made with Suō-dono, a reply came from Nijō-dono to Suō-no-kami-dono stating, "There are no postponements of shrine festivals on such occasions." Accordingly, the horse racing was held. Additionally,

Suō-no-kami-dono's horses did not participate. The Imamiya Festival was postponed, and many other shrine festivals were also postponed. Nevertheless, the horse racing meet was held.
Kiyoshige, consulting the Shigemura Records, states: "On the 20th day of the 4th month of Keian 4 (1651), the Great Tree Iemitsu-kō passed away. Regarding the horse racing scheduled for the 1st and 5th days of the 5th month, word came from Itakura Suō-no-kami that if there were precedents, it should be postponed. However, since there were no precedents, when this matter was appealed, no decision was rendered until the 30th day of the 4th month. It was heard that Suō-no-kami inquired of the Nijō-dono household about what was found in old records, regarding precedents for conducting divine festivals when the Shōgun passed away.

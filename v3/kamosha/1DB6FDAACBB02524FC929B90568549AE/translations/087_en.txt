I examined the circumstances of the destruction and was truly
　　shocked by this utterly inexcusable conduct. However, regarding this matter, I hope to pacify him and settle it peacefully
　　without any other reports being made. Therefore, I am returning the court cap and other items." This was his statement.
　　Ujiryo replied: "This matter has already been reported to the first riders and those below the steps.
　　Since this is the case, it would be difficult to settle it quietly based on personal judgment," and
　　with this response, Yoshiaki withdrew.
　　As night fell, twenty horsemen (norijiri) participated in the vigil as in previous years, and at that time there was
　　an announcement from the first riders regarding what Ujiryo had reported. When each person deliberated on this, they found it entirely
　　reasonable, and therefore decided unanimously that "for the sake of the future as well, it would be difficult to settle this quietly."
　　Accordingly, through both Wakasa-no-kami Narisada and Sakon-dayū Kanekiyo,

　　they conveyed this decision to the monk Mokusuke at the meeting place, requesting that it be announced
　　at the next shrine assembly gathering. The response was:
　　"I have received the details. I will make the announcement
　　at the gathering on the coming seventh day. However, it would be better if the horsemen submit this through a written statement."
　　Sixth day, Clear weather. Today, as in previous years, the horsemen each assembled
　　near Tasha shrine, and from there made pilgrimage to Kifune shrine《marginal note: making offerings at the roadside shrines｜as usual, especially at Ume-no-miya shrine》
　　《marginal note: presenting sacred sake and delicacies｜each partaking》presenting sacred sake and delicacies and completing the offerings, after partaking of the sacred sake,
　　Sōichi presented rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves《marginal note: on three-legged trays｜》to the
　　horsemen according to custom. Next, they made pilgrimage to Oku-gozen, presented sacred sake and delicacies, completed the offerings,
　　and each received hospitality as usual《marginal note: arranged by｜the first riders》. After this, each departed and returned home.

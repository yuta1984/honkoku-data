《Marginal note: Matter concerning brothers taking turns in service being inappropriate》【Red ink】
　1　When the sixth race left Mitsukiyo《Marginal note: substitute Suenori》and right Yoshiaki《Marginal note: substitute Harukiyo》reported for duty, the chief administrators made an inquiry to those below the stairs. Regarding the sixth race riders, the left is the actual person Mitsukiyo, but for the right Yoshiaki, his younger brother Harukiyo is riding as substitute - they wondered if this arrangement was appropriate and wished to consult on the matter. Accordingly, both those below the stairs and the left and right riders consulted, and their response was that no one had noticed this issue when the substitute arrangement was reported. While it is indeed an inappropriate matter, given the immediate circumstances and that Mitsukiyo is also serving as a substitute, for today's purposes it should be left as is for now, with an agreement to avoid such situations in the future. When this was conveyed by the guardians of those below the stairs, all the chief administrators acknowledged and the matter was resolved.

　　as follows: When the rider circles to the west of the sacred building, he raises his left knee,
　　completes the hair arrangement, straightens his knee, takes his fan and performs the ritual gesture. Also during the pairing,
　　during consultation with the head priest, he does not raise his knee, completes the right side, then raises his knee,
　　records the pairing, and gives instructions to the rider while keeping his knee raised.

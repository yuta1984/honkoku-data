Meireki 2nd Year

Third Race: Left - Zusho-no-jō Yasutake
           Right - Gagaku-no-suke Kiyoka 《Marginal note: Victory》

Yasutake served as a substitute for his uncle Yasuka, hence the seating arrangement was thus. Yasuka had fallen from the veranda at the night duty quarters on the second day night and injured his elbow and thigh. Since he was wearing court dress, he rode from that position. This is according to ancient shrine precedent.

Fourth Race: Left - Hyōbu-gon-no-shōyū Kiyomura
            Right - Chikara-no-suke Yasudai 《Marginal note: Auspicious horse | Fell from horse》

This year there was a factional dispute (shisai) within the Sueki family, so Suekane was excluded and Kiyomura was invited.

Sixth Race: Left - Awaji-no-kami Ujimori
           Right - Mokku-no-jō Kazeaki 《Marginal note: First》

Because the contest ended quickly, one person approached the shrine for his first ride but fell from his horse, causing a particularly severe delay. At Sofukuhisa (left side below stairs) there was a question of pardon or defeat, so the left side approached the shrine again.

Ninth Race: Left - Daikenmotsu Ujikane
           Right - Nuido-no-kami Suehiro 《Marginal note: Auspicious horse》

This year there was a factional dispute within the Yasu family, so Yasuuji was excluded and Ujikane was invited.

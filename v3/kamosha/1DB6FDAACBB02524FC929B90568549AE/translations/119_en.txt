wearing their ranso (ceremonial cords), both kaidanka performed the divine offering ceremony at the chō-za. The kaidanka
　　entered through the Hira-chū gate as in previous years and made offerings at the norito-ya《Marginal note: both did not clap hands》. The left-side
　　kaidanka approaching and making offerings at the sacred door while positioning to the left of the approaching deity is
　　not appropriate. The left and right positioning of people should be used as in previous years. The left kaidanka's attendant was
　　Kiyotora《Marginal note: formal court dress》, with Hirotoku《Marginal note: hunting robe》 as his supporter. Although Kiyotora should properly
　　wear hunting robes, he wore formal court dress because Hashikiyō was making rounds inside the barriers. The right kaidanka's
　　attendant was Ujimoto《Marginal note: hunting robe}}. The left attendant separately set up a raised floor table
　　and sat upon it.

　　《Marginal note: Above omitted》Chief Administrator Junior Fifth Rank Lower Ujitatsu, Deputy is Junior Fifth Rank Lower Shigetatsu.
　　The chief administrator's main register is Kenuhaku. Official chief administrator deputy Narimichi serves throughout the year,
　　while the chief administrator deputy role is served by Yoriaki. Due to Yoriaki's illness, Ujitatsu
　　suddenly took on the duties. Ujitatsu is the deputy. In that case, the chief administrator deputy and deputy representative are
　　the same person - how is this appropriate?

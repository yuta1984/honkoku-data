　　Therefore, the deputy administrator Hiraki inquired of the shrine community how the horse arrangements for the fifth day should be handled. After deliberation, it was decided that all matters would follow the horse assignments of the first day of last month, with Sawada hafuri Yoshikiyo, who was transferred this time, serving in place of the Fukuda-no-shō deputy, and the horses would remain tied as they were.
　　This decision was communicated.

　　were proclaimed. Therefore, on the fifth day, the Fukuda-no-shō horse, Ume no Ha Uemon's horse《Marginal note: Sawada hafuri》
　　was tied at Yoshikiyo's residence. This Sawada hafuri should have been tied at Takehara-no-shō, but since the horse inspection and assignments had been completed, the horse assignment document approved by the deputy administrator left Uemon's horse at Fukuda-no-shō as assigned, and it was completed without rewriting the document.

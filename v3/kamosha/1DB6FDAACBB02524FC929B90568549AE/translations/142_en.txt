《Marginal note: Matters concerning horses, horse armor, and other items from Shitori-shō arranged within the shrine》【Written in red ink】
1. Since Lord Sakai Sanuki-no-kami, the goshi (shrine administrator), has been replaced and the replacement goshi has not yet been officially appointed, the horses from Shitori as well as guards and others have been assigned to the entire shrine as in previous years, so they are being dispatched as a matter for the entire shrine. Regarding the horse armor (kōsō), previously they used the one bestowed upon Tsuguhisa, but this time they wished to use ordinary horse equipment, but this was not approved, so they are again borrowing and using the armor owned by Tsuguhisa.

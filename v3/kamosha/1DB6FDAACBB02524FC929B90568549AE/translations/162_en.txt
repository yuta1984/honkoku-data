   a reciprocal bow was performed from under the eaves of Hirajū gate and the matter was concluded. 
   Considering how such irregularities might become precedent, on the later date of May 8th, inquiries were made to Tsunekata regarding the first race left side

   participant Moriyasu, asking how he understood his position as direct participant and chief, and why he blocked
   the ceremonial space of the lower-ranking officials. He replied that it was entirely
   a misunderstanding and extremely improper conduct, and requested that
   the matter be handled with discretion. This matter was reported to Lord Suehashi,
   and since it involved service at the same palace, it was acknowledged and resolved.

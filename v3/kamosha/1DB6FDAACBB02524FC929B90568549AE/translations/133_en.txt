However, when the right side's rider was brought to the curtained area and told of the loss by the lower officials, he protested that it was not a loss and did not dismount, leading to prolonged disorder. Therefore, the head magistrates suggested that it would be appropriate to make it a draw since it was causing delays in the sacred ritual. The lower officials responded that while they had determined it a loss, if it would cause delays in the sacred ritual, then whatever was appropriate would be acceptable, so the matter was settled as a draw.

was sent to request that the right side's horse be replaced, but the response from Shigemoto was: "Replacing the horse now would be troublesome, so please have the riders continue to serve as they are, and I ask that you make appropriate arrangements among the riders."

1. On the same 2nd day, when an application was made to Kiaki's side regarding the first ride, they said "Regarding the matter of horse replacement that was requested as mentioned before, please continue to serve as is," and sent this message repeatedly. Therefore, after nightfall, both messengers Shigetsubu and Seiaki were sent again to make the request: "We have received your response, but since this is an important sacred ritual, please by all means replace one horse from the right side." However, they responded that "Shigemoto's daughter is critically ill and he is preoccupied with this matter, so please continue to serve as is," and repeatedly declined. Having no choice, we first proceeded to serve in that manner.

1. On the 5th day in the 9th bout, left side Kiaki and right side Kaneaki served, but as you all witnessed, due to the bad horses, Kiaki fell from his horse. As a result, his sashinuki (court trousers) were damaged, and due to the time needed for changing clothes, the sacred ritual was delayed. The riders are troubled by this matter, so we humbly request that from now on, the shrine community make appropriate arrangements for safe horses to be sent to the general Horse Bureau. The above.

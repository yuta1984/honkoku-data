Regarding the Horse Racing on the First and Fifth Days of the Fifth Month

Hōreki 2nd year (1752)
《Marginal note: The thick horse trappings and complete set for the Shidori-shō horses to be prepared by the shrine》【Written in red ink】

1. Regarding the horses from Shidori-shō, since the goshoshi (shrine administrator) has not yet come to Kyoto, this matter was handled as a decision of one shrine. The decorations and other items were prepared as usual, with gold nashiji lacquer saddles. One monme worth belongs to Shōkyū, and one set is owned by the shrine for decoration. Concerning the large horse trappings (ōbusa), after the death of Lord Matsudaira Bungo-no-kami, they came from Yamamoto Kanai Seiko to Umetsuji Mino-no-kami. We had previously petitioned the magistrate's office, stating "Regarding the large horse trappings, while our single shrine does not possess them, there are those among the seven family shrine administrators who do possess them, so we would like to use them." In response, there was an inquiry asking "How exactly are they possessed among the seven family shrine administrators?"

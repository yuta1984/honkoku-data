《Marginal note: Matter of reporting when suddenly changing horses》【Red ink】
1. Regarding the matter where Kibune Chief Priest's horse had an injury and was suddenly replaced, requiring notification - since the head priest was also unprepared, when Suefumi Shiaki was consulted, the accounts of both parties were inconsistent. Shiaki made his submission based on the precedent from Kanpō 3rd year, but answered only that it was a matter to be reported to the deputy, so the notification came from the horse office.

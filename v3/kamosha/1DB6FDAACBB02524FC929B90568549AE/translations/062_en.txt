Sueyoshi said: "Because the sacred ritual did not proceed properly, there was a restart, and the right horse fell at the exit."
{{Marginal note: Right side fell twice at exit and maple tree area, left side had no restart at all |}}
It was declared a loss. The right horse fell twice - at the exit and above the maple tree. However, the left horse

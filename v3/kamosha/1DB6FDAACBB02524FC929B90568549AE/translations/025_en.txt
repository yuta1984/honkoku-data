《Marginal note: The matter of holding the fifth day's sake ceremony on the evening of the fourteenth day in the office building》【Red ink】
At this time, the fifth day's sake ceremony was held on the evening of the fourteenth day in the office building. The details are as follows:

Hitachi-no-kami fell from his horse in the first heat, and Ōsumi-no-kami was in the pursuing position. When Hitachi-no-kami sent out his horse, he fell, so after waiting for a while, Ōsumi-no-kami sent out his horse and claimed victory. However, Hitachi-no-kami mounted his horse and returned within the barrier, had his horse withdrawn, and his clan members and other supporters argued that he should appeal to the office building. But there was no precedent for the loser to appeal to the office building. Some said that if so, Ōsumi-no-kami should also return, while others argued that Ōsumi, having won, should not have to return - the debate was divided. The ceremonial sake of the year-end sequence could not proceed, and when the shrine officials departed, all the riders also departed. At that time, the fifth day's sake ceremony was held on the fourteenth day.

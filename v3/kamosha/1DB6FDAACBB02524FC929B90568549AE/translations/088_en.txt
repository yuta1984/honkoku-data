Sueteru《marginal note: Sueteru is｜the brother-in-law of Ujiryo's sister}}. The content was that regarding Ujiryo's matter, this time from the eighth group
they had requested Kanerui's services《marginal note: Although Ukyō-shin Yasumasa was a left horseman of the eighth group, he declined｜so the eighth group suddenly requested Ujiryo to serve as Kanerui}}
{{marginal note: for this reason｜}}, and a disturbance occurred, which they found regrettable. Therefore, should this matter be settled quietly,
or should an investigation be conducted? They wished to know the decision."
The response was: "I have received the details. This matter was initially reported
to the horsemen and those below the steps, but it should still be investigated and

reported to the entire shrine community." This was the response given.

　　Memorandum of Statement
Regarding the recent horse race on the fifth day, when I lost
while riding the horse of the chief negi of the horse grounds,
the horse owner Rokubei spoke terrible insults in front of those below the steps. With various
people listening, I thought I could hardly bear it, but considering it was an important sacred ritual,
I thought it unavoidable and was returning home when, at the corner of Yamamoto-chō, a large
crowd was waiting and again hurled insults, surrounding me and continuing to speak, so in distress I tried to clear them away with my whip,
whereupon they grabbed the whip and beat me severely, striking my court cap

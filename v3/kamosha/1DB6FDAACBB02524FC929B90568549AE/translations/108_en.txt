matter. We were also commanded to report on this point, etc. Therefore,
　　there should be a meeting tomorrow.
26th day, clear weather. After breakfast, there was a shrine meeting. We disclosed what was
　　commanded at the Magistrate's Office yesterday regarding the precedents for postponing the horse racing,
　　which should be received later. This is as per the document to be submitted to the senior court liaison.
　　However, writing "according to the Nisui-ki" on the right, and "Suiki extract" on the left,
　　and omitting only the two characters for "abbreviation." Kiyoshige wrote this out. Thus
　　the oral statement was completed and brought to the Magistrate's Office. Draft
　　　Statement in response to inquiry
　Item: Regarding the postponement of the Kamigamo horse racing ritual, upon investigation

　　On April 7th, Daiei 6 [1526], Emperor Go-Kashiwabara passed away. At that time, the horse
　　racing was postponed and executed on June 1st and 5th of the same year, as recorded in the shrine records
《I note: This precedent shows June 1st and 5th in the shrine family records, but the Nisui-ki shows June 11th and 15th. Should we follow the Nisui-ki?》
　　as visible, Your Honor
　Item: Since the horse racing ritual is a matter of enjoying horse racing, spectators
　　crowd together, and market vendors gather, making it difficult for the shrine families to control through their authority alone.
　　Therefore, unlike ordinary rituals, we humbly believe it cannot be conducted without
　　security officials being dispatched from the government, Your Honor
《Since ancient times, there has been no negligence in the horse racing meet》【in vermillion ink】
　Item: Since ancient times, there are no records of this ritual being neglected,
　　we humbly request to execute it, whether postponed or not
　　　As stated above, we will postpone it at this time and again

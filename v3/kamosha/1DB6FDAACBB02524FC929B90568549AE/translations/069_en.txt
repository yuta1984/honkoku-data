《Marginal note: Matter of dispute regarding determination of victory/defeat between head priest and lower rank officials》【Written in red】

This year there was a dispute regarding the determination of victory and defeat between the head priest and lower-ranking officials. On the evening of the 3rd, there was a confrontation at the council chamber with many matters disclosed. The first point was that matters of horse racing victories and defeats should be determined by the head priest, with the head priest making direct announcements. At that time, the assembled council members and newly appointed judges remained silent and speechless. Upon hearing this, Ujizamurai said, "This is a rare and novel request. Generally speaking, how do you understand the matter of the head priest taking a seat?" He requested to hear the details. Though there was silence, Ujizamurai said, "Well then, the seating is for the messenger who determines victory and defeat. However, it is also for the attendants of the divine procession," and thus inquired.

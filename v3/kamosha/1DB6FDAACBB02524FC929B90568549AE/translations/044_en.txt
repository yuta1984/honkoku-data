Third Race: Left - Tajima-no-kami Seigen
           Right - Hyōbu-no-jō Yasuki 《Marginal note: Late defeat | fell from horse and lost consciousness》

Such were the substitute horses. At that time, Seigen and those below sent a messenger to the horse office.
Head Priest Norifumi replied: "Regarding this matter, sending a messenger from the horse office directly to me without going through the deputy officials is unprecedented" - a most reasonable response. Yasuki and those above sent a messenger to inform the deputies "the situation is thus" and presented their case to the horse office.
The reply was "most reasonable."

Fifth Race: Left - Shuzei-no-suke Yasudai
           Right - Minbu-no-shōyū Nagaaki 《Marginal note: Right slightly late, carrying defeat, deemed adequate》

we humbly request, as we previously stated
　　The above
　　　　　　　　Kamigamo Single Shrine Representative
　Year of the Dragon　　　　　　Fujiki Hayato-no-kami
　　April 26th　Same　　　Torii Oji Sakyo
　　　To the Magistrate's Office
After submitting the above, we were commanded to appear
on the 28th of this month at the hour of the Horse (around 10 AM)
【In small characters】On the 26th, representative Sahei Shōken wrote this up
Also, we were asked: "When Tōshō-gū passed away, were horses offered?"
This matter also remains unclear. During the time of Daiyū-in,
were horses indeed not offered? During the time of Princess Onna-san-no-miya, whether horses were offered
remains unclear. Were these matters also as reported the other day? we were asked, therefore
we replied that it was as stated. Then the intermediary said that a written statement should be
submitted accordingly, so both representatives immediately submitted a written statement, etc. The content was:
Tōshō-gū
　Died on April 17th, Genna 2 [1616], whether horses were
　offered to the Imperial Court office, we could not investigate
Daiyū-in
　Died on April 20th, Keian 4 [1651], horses were
　not offered to the Imperial Court office. Officials came out

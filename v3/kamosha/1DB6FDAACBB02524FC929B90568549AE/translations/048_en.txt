Using the imperial whip of Retired Emperor Go-Toba, Mikawa-no-kami Kanesato, who was the retired emperor's craftsman, made a transcription. Especially through the convenience of Kōken, Daigo Rishō-in-dono performed the blessing ritual. This is recorded in Ujinawa's private notes.

Kanbun 5th year (1665)

　　　Left　Nuido-no-jō Yasufuku
Second race
　　　Right　Hyōbu-gon-no-shōsuke Kiyomura

The left rider violated precedent by charging ahead slightly. Even so, without re-entering directly, he should have maintained a winning posture.
The right rider, thinking this violated precedent, withdrew and changed. Therefore, there were several decisive words, and due to the judgment of those below, since it was not considered a loss, there was much ridicule. However, due to exceptionally heavy rain, the event concluded without incident.

Eighth race

{{Marginal note: Matter of roof defeat, not considering defeat, direct court seating}} [Red ink]
In the eighth race, the left rider suffered a "roof defeat." However, the right rider decisively re-entered directly. Though it was also a "roof defeat," there was much ridicule in the direct court pavilion seating. Later it was heard that connecting the paired horses of the ninth race, they decided victory and defeat themselves, running out from near the trees. Creating such horses was ridiculed as being unprecedented.
The right rider broke away and ran, but since there was combined whipping, it should have been considered a victory. However, there were words again, and due to the decision, he re-entered directly. Though he ran alone, the left rider was not considered defeated. Therefore, resentment remained.

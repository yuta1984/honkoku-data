When the above document was submitted, it was accepted without objection. Later we heard that from Kii-no-kami to the Buke-densō (court-bakufu liaison officials - Yanagihara Former Dainagon Sukakado and Takano Former Chūnagon Yasuharu), an inquiry was made to Shirakawa-dono regarding the details of earth defilement, and the two documents (from the 25th and 27th days) that had been submitted from the shrine families to the warrior houses were also forwarded.

Accordingly, on the same 28th day, one written response was submitted from Shirakawa-dono, which was then sent from both densō to Kii-no-kami's residence.
That document reads as follows (This document is not recorded in the shrine's official diary. It was privately copied in confidence):
　　　Memorandum of Oral Statement
1. Regarding Matsudaira Kii-no-kami having been contaminated by defilement on this occasion, we have acknowledged the inquiry as to what should be thought about sending people and horses to the Kamo foot inspection and horse racing.
1. If they are people and horses mixed with earth defilement, we believe respectful abstention is most appropriate. Naturally, since defilement has three levels of severity (kō, otsu, hei), there are considerations to be weighed.

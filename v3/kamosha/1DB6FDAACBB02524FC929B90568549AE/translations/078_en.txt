It was thus decided. At that time, the substitute Shigetatsu withdrew. That night, deliberation was conducted by the group, and Nuinodono-no-jō Yasutomo was urgently requested to ride. This matter was communicated to the administrator. Also, due to the urgent nature, all arrangements were handled by the group for the riding.
《Marginal note: Because the person in light mourning was suddenly replaced, regarding the purification ceremony on the morning of the 4th day after breakfast》
Due to the urgency, Echigo-no-kami Suetome's residence was requested to serve the purpose. Tomorrow, on the 4th day after breakfast, the Onmyō-dayū will perform the purification ceremony near Suetome's gate. I record this as an example.

Jōkyō 4th year
　　Left　Daizen-no-suke Suetoki《Marginal note: victory》
7th race
　　Right　Jibu-no-jō Sennao《Marginal note: did not bring out horse and forfeited》
《Marginal note: The matter of not bringing out the horse and forfeiting》

　　Left　Nuinodono-no-kami Ujiyoshi《Marginal note: fell from horse at exit, lost》
10th race
　　Right　Ukyō-no-suke Suemoto《Marginal note: victory》

Jōkyō 5th year《Marginal note: month day era change, became Genroku 1st year》
　　Left first　Izumi-no-kami Sadahisa《Marginal note: lower left》
2nd race
　　Right　Sakyō-no-shin Yasushiro《Marginal note: upper right, subsequently won》

Sadahisa was slightly delayed at the exit and stumbled in front of the temporary hall, therefore becoming disordered and delayed in front of both lower steps. Due to umbrellas blocking the view, the delay at the exit resulted in a loss.
《Marginal note: The questioning before the lower steps was unseemly, so returned as a loss》
Sadahisa had previously been known for unseemly questioning, and especially since it was overseen by those at the lower steps, he returned as a loss.

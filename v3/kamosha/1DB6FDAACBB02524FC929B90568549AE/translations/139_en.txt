In response to this inquiry, a person named Umetsuji Mino-no-kami stated that he had "received it from Lord Matsudaira Bungo-no-kami." When asked "If that is the case, is there no ritual impurity?", he replied "There is absolutely no matter of impurity," whereupon he was told "Then you may do as you wish." Therefore, decorations were prepared as usual, and four hakuchō (attendants) each were assigned as jōryū (riders). The horse owner was Takeno Matauemon, and the substitute horse was provided by Ume no Tarōzaemon.

1. On the first day of the fifth month, Kibune negi Yoshihirohisa was transferred to become Kataoka hafuri, and Semefune hafuri Yoshihisa was transferred to become the same negi, with imperial permission granted. This was announced in the evening. Although this transfer took place, regarding the horse entries, things remained as per the original ketsuke (pairing) for the first day, with the horse tied to Kibune negi Hirohisa for the third race. After the transfer, only the shōtsuke (nominal assignment) would change to Kataoka hafuri Hirohisa, but the horse would remain in the third race. Yoshihisa's horse and the deputy's horse followed the same pattern - only the nominal assignment changed, while the horses remained according to the original pairing.

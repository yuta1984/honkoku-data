Oral report submitted for notification
　　This time
　　Regarding the matter of the Empress Dowager's residence, concerning the horse racing ritual, we consulted the old records of how this has been conducted even during periods of mourning for noble persons, and inquired of Lord Bōjō, Major Counselor and court liaison. As the ancient precedent is clear, he issued the directive that it should be conducted as in previous years, and the shrine humbly accepts this. The above is submitted for notification. Above stated.

　　After this, the court liaison summoned [us] again, and when the chief representative attended, [he said] regarding the horse racing matter, we did not request that it be carried out as on the previous day, and since it is a ritual involving crowds, should it perhaps be stopped? Furthermore, since such matters also involve the military government, when we said that the military government should also be consulted, there was a discrepancy in what was reported to the military government, as if we had instructed them to "carry it out immediately." Due to this directive, here on our side, the shrine administrator Nakatsukasa, according to the written document, then made the report to Nakatsukasa, whereupon Nakatsukasa was astonished. Consequently, he directed that this should be resolved harmoniously without it becoming an error on the part of the shrine families. Accordingly, the written notification to be submitted to the military government is recorded below:

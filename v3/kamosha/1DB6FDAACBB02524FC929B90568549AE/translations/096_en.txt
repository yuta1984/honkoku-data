Whether it is light mourning or heavy mourning would be acceptable?
Regarding the above matter, there would be degrees of severity in formal mourning - are there any written records of precedents from such occasions? Kii-no-kami's formal mourning period is brief, and there may still be earth defilement. Even if purification is ordered, a written document with an official seal should be submitted stating that there are still no impediments.
　　　4th month, 27th day of the Year of the Boar

According to the above matter, we immediately convened at the shrine for discussion and brought a written response. The draft is as follows:
　　　Oral statement in response to inquiry
1. Regarding the horse inspection on the 1st day of the coming 5th month, the horse racing on the 5th day of the same month, and the guards for these events: we respectfully state that if purification is ordered for Kii-no-kami's organized groups and retainers who will attend, there will be no problem. We state this believing that they will certainly not come into contact with earth defilement, but if they do encounter earth defilement, we believe it would be a matter requiring respectful abstention.
1. Regarding the decorated horses that are to be purified in the Kamo River starting from the 28th day (of this month) by order: likewise, if they encounter earth defilement as mentioned above, we believe it would be a matter requiring respectful abstention.
　　　Here there is a posted notice: "If nobles residing in other residences attend, there is no earth defilement."

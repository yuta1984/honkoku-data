Sakon-no-taifu Mitsuaki rode as a substitute for Shigeaki. For Hachirōza, Koto-no-taifu Sukesuke rode as a substitute for Miki-no-kami Suemasa. Kura-no-suke Ujiyutaka rode as a substitute for Minbu-no-jō Ujiei. This change occurred suddenly due to the Kyōfuku ceremony of the court ladies.

One source says that initially Minbu-no-jō Ujiei's mother died at dawn on the fifth day, so Kura-no-suke rode as his substitute.

《Marginal note: Concerning Tanaka Jūrōzaemon's provision of horse racing hakama》【Red ink】
The horse racing hakama were provided by Lord Tanaka Jūrōzaemon through the intermediation of Kunai-no-shōyu Yasumochi.

The above sequence of horse races from Tenbun 11th year to Bunroku 4th year was copied in his own hand by the late Bizen-no-kami Hideaki.

Keichō 2nd year (1597)
《Marginal note: Red ink》
One source says that this year there were unruly horses. When there are unruly horses, having them ridden by the right rider of the first race is ancient law. However, the right rider of the first race did not ride, thus violating old precedent. The precedent should be investigated again. It also says that Echizen-no-kami made a request. That Echizen-no-kami was sent as a messenger from Lord Ichijō to Ōmi Province before the festival and then made this request is unprecedented. Therefore, both on the first and second days, there were nineteen people on night duty. Nineteen people also presented the ceremonial costumes for the third day. One person's portion remained. There was a gathering of old and young at Ei-dō Hall. There were no purification ceremonies for shrine visits or purification collars - such examples have never been heard of since ancient times.

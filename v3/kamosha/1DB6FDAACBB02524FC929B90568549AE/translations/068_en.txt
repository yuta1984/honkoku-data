Regarding the matter that guidance of victory or defeat by the supervisors (kanjin) at the exit is unnecessary

One: According to the Seirei Diary, on the 5th day of the 5th month of Enpō 6 (1678), in the fourth horse race, the left rider was Saheiji-no-kami Yasumitsu and the right rider was Uemon-dayū Toraaki. In the match, Toraaki won and Yasumitsu lost.

The seated head priest and messengers from below sent shrine attendants (jinin) to communicate that it was difficult for both riders to coordinate, and since their coordination was poor, they should perform an irinao (remount) as supervisors within the barriers. However, both left and right riders had fallen from their horses, and particularly the right rider Yasumitsu was in pain. Nevertheless, it was determined that a remount must absolutely be performed, so Yasumitsu's son Tsurufuku-dayū, wearing his father's pure robes, though inadequate, hastily changed his attire and rode. This was an unprecedented and extraordinary procedure.

○On the 6th day of the 5th month, at the meeting, the head priest disclosed the circumstances of the victory and defeat in the fourth horse race and the manner of the remount. For the future, it was decided that guidance regarding victory or defeat from the supervisors should be deemed unnecessary, and so forth.

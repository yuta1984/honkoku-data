One: In the third match between left Shigesa【Representative: Yasutake】and right Tomikiyo, when Tomikiyo's horse did not appear, it was determined to be a stay-loss, but Tomikiyo argued that since the signal did not sound properly he had held back, so it was not a stay-loss and he should be allowed to re-enter. Although there was a long argument by the right side before the lower officials, since both the lower officials and the starting gate supervisors confirmed that the signal had sounded and the horse did not appear, it was determined to be a stay-loss, and he was made to withdraw.

【Since both left and right fell from their horses in front of the decisive marker, it became a re-entry, but the right side claimed to have injuries and requested a substitute】
Also in the seventh match, left Moriaki and right Kanemoto, both fell from their horses【The left side also requested a substitute】in front of the decisive marker, so it became a re-entry. At this time, since Kanemoto had injuries, Suminao【(second right)】rode as his substitute, so it was decided that Moriaki should also have a substitute, and Nobuho【(first left)】rode, resulting in a draw.

"Is that so? Then we shall make an appeal to the shrine community," etc. The second reply said, "Indeed, I humbly accept." Therefore, the matter was resolved peacefully. Generally, when Kanatsu loses in horse racing, he does not appear at the shrine front according to ancient law, so this is recorded for future generations.

On the morning of the 6th day, when going to visit Kawakami Shrine according to old custom, due to unprecedented heavy rain in recent years, the large drum and bell were struck early and the locality was in commotion. However, when visiting Kawakami, the villagers reported that Ichihara Bridge was dangerous, so they returned from Bishamondō, prayed at the Shinmei shrine south of the bridge, and performed libations. They made offerings again at the front of the New Shrine.

At that time, one of the first riders, Hōrō, said alone: "We should return to our village and have evening meals at the meeting place. Everyone should attend wearing only eboshi caps."

In reply, Ujinawa, one elder among the nineteen people, responded: "Today there is heavy rain and flooding, so the locality will be disturbed. Under such circumstances, wearing pure robes and having ceremonial meals at each meeting place would not be appropriate. We should simply postpone it." Again, one first rider said: "There are expenses for provisions, but we have enough to carry it out." He spoke invoking the divine name. Regarding the actions of the three people, since not even one person's sworn response was adequate, Ujinawa disagreed.

At that time, on the road, Shōhei approached Ujinawa for private consultation, saying: "The first riders' arguments are insufficient. However, since this is a celebration, what about holding it simply at the imiko-ya (purification hut)?"

Ujinawa replied: "That would be acceptable," and it was carried out at the imiko-ya. As the heavy rain intensified and caused great flooding, the public embankments and fields near the riverbank suffered great damage. Particularly, the great flood in the shrine's horse racing grounds was unprecedented in ancient and modern times. Immediately, the head of purification and the jockeys together carried the Kawao Shrine into the Sakura Gate and relocated it within the Middle Gate.

1　Regarding the Shingū ritualist's horse, while it was recorded as "skylark-colored" in the preliminary inspection,
　　when observed during the grooming ceremony, it was actually a deer-colored horse. Therefore it was recorded as deer-colored, and
　　after the races concluded, the inspector was summoned and questioned, whereupon he
　　admitted his negligence. He was then instructed to ensure that such discrepancies
　　would not occur again, and the matter was resolved.

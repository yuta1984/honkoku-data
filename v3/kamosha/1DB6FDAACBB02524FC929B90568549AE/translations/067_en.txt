[The horse] was strong. It crossed over the bridge of the Mitarashi River and at the eastern end had a slight fall, but entered the御生囲所 (onyō-kakoisho, an enclosure area) and stopped on its own.

Left: Uma-no-jō Yasumasa (fell behind due to running down at the exit, resulting in defeat)
Third match
Right: Gagaku-no-suke Kiyohide

Left: Mikawa-gon-no-kami Suetō (Since Suetō was bedridden with malaria, his substitute who wore the pure robes, Ujiaki, was extremely reluctant, and his brother Suenori who was to substitute was also suffering from malaria, so for some time...)

Seventh match
Right: Jibu-no-jō Sennao (The head priest questioned the lower ranks about whether calling knowledge "sudden" was appropriate and how about the insufficient substitute service. The answer was that if pure robes were worn, there would be no problem and no mistake.)

This time the shoshi-dai (deputy administrator) was replaced, and Lord Toda Echizen-no-kami Tadatsugu reformed all matters and came to give orders for both days of horse racing, among other things. First, the complete horse equipment was magnificently prepared, unprecedented in recent years, causing all people to be amazed. Particularly within the barriers, no common people were allowed entry, and above and below, two sword-bearers each in formal dress held spears, while over twenty dōshin (constables) held staffs to keep people away. Therefore, not a single person entered within the barriers, and of course there was no striking of horses with sticks. The area within the barriers maintained a sacred dignity, an unprecedented sight in ancient and modern times, truly an honorable occasion.

Enpō 6 (1678)
Left: Saheiji-no-kami Yasumitsu
Fourth match
Right: Uemon-dayū Toraaki

The left rider, Saheiji-no-kami Yasumitsu, was very strong but fell from his horse. However, he walked and remounted. This was an入直 (irinao, remount). For this remount, his son Tsurufuku-dayū Yasuharu rode.

1. In the fifth race, both left and right riders fell from their horses before reaching the decisive point (hoko) of the match, so the left side's kajika (lower-ranking official) requested a rematch (iri-nao). The right side's kajika also conveyed this intent to the chief coordinators (kimoiri-chū) at the starting point, and a rematch was to be held. However, Yoshiyasu from the left side stated that due to his fall, he was in considerable pain and riding would be difficult. Nevertheless, since the match remained undecided and such matters could not be left unresolved, and furthermore, since he had ridden his horse to the starting point again after the fall, it was argued that riding should not be impossible. Despite this appeal, he maintained that riding was absolutely impossible. When it was suggested that a substitute rider could be appointed, this matter was referred to the shrine authorities, but the response was that riding would be difficult without the personal dedication (ichibun no nyūkon) of the original participant.

Since the kajika also responded that appointing a substitute would be acceptable under special circumstances, it was considered that continuing would cause delays and complications, so it would be better to settle the matter through kyoi-make (default loss). However, such direction from the kajika would be difficult, and the kajika expressed complete dissatisfaction (fuzombun) with this arrangement. Eventually, the matter was resolved with a default loss, allowing only Narifumi (the right side winner) to complete his ride. However, the default conducted without proper cap adjustment, without releasing the horse's bit, and particularly with the horse facing south, involved various irregular procedures that should not serve as precedent for future cases.

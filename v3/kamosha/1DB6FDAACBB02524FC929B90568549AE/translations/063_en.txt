He answered again, saying that those words meant "The magistrate disclosed this matter to the assembled seat the other day."
At that time, the evaluation of the seat said that "The results of the three examinations should be
disclosed to the shrine community," and this should be appealed to the meeting place, etc. Therefore, when informing
the meeting place, when there was a disclosure to the seat of the shrine magistrate's council concurrent position, 
the answer from the shrine was "By all means, new riders should be accepted. When there are no such people
at that time, veteran jockeys would be unavoidable," etc. In any case, upholding the ancient laws
is essential.

Enpō 3rd year (1675)
This year also, like last year, the jockeys made requests and asked for horse-exit supervisors.
{{Marginal note: Supervisors of the 1st day come from the jockeys of the 5th day. Supervisors of the 5th day come from the jockeys of the 1st day |}}
They requested supervisors within the barriers of the 1st day, and through evaluation, twenty people from the festival

jockeys were sent out to serve as magistrates. Also, for the festival, twenty people from the 1st day jockey
group came out as magistrates within the barriers. Also, the supervisors to stop
the spectators of the Kurakake who break away in groups at the end of the horse grounds, as well as the troublemakers,
were four people, namely four from among the 1st day jockeys: Yōken, Yasumasa, Yasutomo, and
Ujioki. It was indeed a heartfelt situation, etc.

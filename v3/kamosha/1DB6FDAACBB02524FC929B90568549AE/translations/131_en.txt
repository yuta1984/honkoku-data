【Matter of dissatisfaction regarding the third match left side's loss】【Written in red ink】
One: Regarding the left side's loss in the third match, when the lower rank officials reported this matter, the left side's representative Kyoken (for Yasunobu) did not accept it, stating that since the cap sounds did not match, it should be a draw. However, the right side's Tsuneuji claimed victory, saying their cap sounds matched properly. This led to a dispute between left and right sides. The exit supervisors stated that the sounds did match, so it was decided accordingly. The right side performed the horseback ceremony and rode to the left side's lower rank pavilion. They repeatedly insisted it was not a loss, but as this was not accepted, consultation was held with the seated officials through Ujimoto. Head Priest Ōhei said that when such disputes arise, it causes delays in the sacred rituals, and moreover, since the left side sent a representative while the right side participated directly, it would be proper for the representative party to withdraw. This matter was conveyed to the horseback participant and the issue was resolved.

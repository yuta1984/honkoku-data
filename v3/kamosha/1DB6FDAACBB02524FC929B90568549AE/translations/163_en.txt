《Marginal note: Matter of the lead horse and chase horse order being incorrect but allowed to proceed》【Red ink】
1. In the second race, Kifune Negi should have been the chase horse at Shōjō and Shingū Negi should have been the lead horse,
   but due to a misunderstanding by the exit supervisor, Shingū Negi's horse was made the chase horse,
   and the ceremonial procedures and other matters were incorrect. Neither the deputy administrator nor the supervisors
   noticed, and it was allowed to proceed. In such cases, corrections should be made and
   the procedure should be restarted.

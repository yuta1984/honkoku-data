《Same》　Shrine Priest Sanni　(seal)

When the above was brought, it was asked whether there would be a difference in procedure between the mourning period (kichu) and the formal mourning (fuku) for Kii-no-kami. We replied that both formal mourning and mourning period should be treated the same way, so we revised the aforementioned document《stating that the mourning period should be treated the same》and submitted it. However, the same details were also reported to both magistrates, Andō Suruga-no-kami and Nakane Settsu-no-kami.

On the same 27th day, summoned by the magistrate Nakane Settsu-no-kami, the Kamo shrine family representative immediately went to him, where various questions were asked and handed over in writing as follows:

Memorandum
1. Regarding the horse inspection on the 1st day of the coming 5th month and the horse racing on the 5th day of the same month, and the guards for these events: if purification is ordered for Kii-no-kami's retainers and organized groups who will participate, there will be no problem.
　　Although there may still be earth defilement, would this be acceptable?
1. Decorated horses are traditionally purified in the Kamo River starting from the 28th day (of the 4th month) each year by order.
　　Same as above
1. There are precedents of guards being dispatched during the formal mourning periods of Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami, Inaba Tango-no-kami, and Gomi Bizen-no-kami.

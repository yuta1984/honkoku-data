1. Regarding this year's horse selection, omitting the preliminary rounds (ko-buri) and proceeding directly from the second main race is against precedent. This seems to be entirely due to carelessness among the chief magistrates.

[On the night of the 4th, Yasuo became incapacitated, so Ujiikiyo substituted and the finger-pointing ceremony was not necessary] 【Written in red ink】
1. The eldest son [4 years old] of Jin-suke Dayū Yasuo, the left rider of the third race among the five riders, died around the hour of the dog on the night of the 4th [smallpox, it is said]. Due to this, Echizen-no-kami Ujiikiyo from the same group immediately took his place as substitute and was additionally assigned to substitute for the left side of the third race. Since this occurred after the shrine purification, the finger-pointing ceremony was not necessary according to precedent.

However, that same night, there was no need for the Onmyō master to go to Ujiikiyo's residence to conduct a new purification ceremony; it was sufficient to transfer the arrangements from Yasuo's residence to Ujiikiyo's residence.

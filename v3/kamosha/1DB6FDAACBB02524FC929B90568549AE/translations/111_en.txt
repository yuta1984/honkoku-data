On the 28th, the representatives Bingo-no-kami, Gunhisa Hayato-no-shō, and Shōken, both serving as magistrates, visited the residence of Magistrate Settsu-no-kami-dono, where the official Kumakura Ichinodayū served as intermediary and conveyed that during this time, examples of postponing horse racing should be submitted, and a formal petition should be submitted subsequently.
If so, we shall do accordingly. Furthermore, when the ritual defilement is resolved, we shall petition in advance.
Regarding this postponement, it was stated as a second point that it was not ordered by the military houses. The representatives accepted this, and the magistrate

went to Suruga-no-kami-dono to report this matter, then proceeded to the Imperial Messenger Magistrate
to make the report and withdrew.

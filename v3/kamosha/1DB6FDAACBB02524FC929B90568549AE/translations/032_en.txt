The left side of the seventh match above was Kura-no-jo Tamenao's first ride. He rode in place of Sama-no-jo Toshinao. The left side of the ninth match, Shume-no-suke Naonao, was the brother of Kura-no-jo.

《Marginal note: At the time of first riding, brothers have not ridden since ancient times》【Red ink】
It has been the ancient custom that brothers do not ride at the time of first riding.
However, Naonao came up from Edo on the 28th day of the 4th month and was suddenly made to ride. This was an oversight and extremely irregular. It should not be used as precedent in the future.

Kan'ei 14th year (1637)
This year, the horse of Hosokawa Sansai appeared. There was talk that it was a strong horse.
However, it was an exceptionally docile horse. On the 1st day, Kunai-no-taiyu rode it,
and on the 5th day, Senmatsu-no-taiyu (Yasusuke) rode it. It stood in the dirt field. On the 5th day, it went up to the left of the second match.

　　　　Fourth match
　　　　　　　　《Marginal note: It appears that two people fly over, but if both sides are drawn apart, one person crosses》
　　　　　　Right　Ōsumi-no-kami Shigenobu《Marginal note: Upper right》　　　　　　　《Marginal note: This precedent is common》

There is talk that for the first time, two of the riders crossed over. However,
this is what ignorant people say. If both sides are drawn apart, there is no reason for two people to cross over.

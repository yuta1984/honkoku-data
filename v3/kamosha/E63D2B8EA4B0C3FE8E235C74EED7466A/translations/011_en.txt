Respectfully Submitted Petition
In the third month of the previous year of the Dog, abstinence was ordered for Torii Oji Dewa-no-kami Masahira, Fujiki Echizen-no-kami Suminao, and Nishiike Ukyo-no-gon-no-suke Sueyoshi. At this time they are in extreme difficulty. We humbly wish to petition for their pardon and would like to consult with the entire shrine. Although we feel it is presumptuous to repeatedly submit such petitions, given these circumstances, if you would graciously grant pardon through your compassionate judgment, the entire shrine community would be most grateful. The above.

Third month of the Boar year　　　　Representative of Kamo Shrine
To Lord Hino Ben and the administrative staff

Since postponement was a difficult matter, two people were kept behind while two were sent back to Shimogamo. Given this situation, everyone was first dismissed, and it was arranged with Gakuaki at the meeting place that another small council meeting would be called once responses came from both villages later.

Today's attendees were head priests Masahisa, Naruhisa, Tsunekiyo, Kunishi, Sueshū, Yasukaku, and Yasutsu. Yoaki was absent due to guard duty, and Yasuka from the mountain attended. Nobuyasu was absent because he was attending to the cutting of stakes. Tsunekiyo, Kunishi, and Sueshū were there because they had been entrusted with water-related duties since last year.

Today as well, to collect stonefish to be sent to the Shinka family, Hirohisa, Yasukaku, Mikiyo, and two day laborers went out to the river. They were scheduled to be sent immediately today via the servant Kihachi.
According to this plan, the stonefish caught yesterday were sent today via Seishichi in place of the servant Kinpachi. They were specifically sent to three people at Nishikata Shinka: Irie Zenbei, Nakai Naojirō, and Watanabe Jūrobei. A reply letter came from Nakai Naojirō, but the other two were away from home. The names from our side were the three construction officials. Also, the stonefish caught today are scheduled to be brought by Kihachi early tomorrow morning, and he will wait at the intermediate lodging for the representative to appear.

Around the middle of the hour of the Sheep (around 2 PM), written statements with seals were brought from Koyama and Nakamura villages. The text was as follows:

　　Memorandum
One: We acknowledge what was ordered today. However, since we have not yet reached a decision after consulting with other village headmen from our main offices, we have requested an extension until the 20th, so we must also decline today's matter. The above.

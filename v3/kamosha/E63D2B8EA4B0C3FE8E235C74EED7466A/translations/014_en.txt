was not reached, so the petition was returned.

1. Around half past the hour of the Sheep, those attending the small meeting were: Head Priest Masahisa, Tsunekiyo, Yoken, Sueshū, Hoshika, Hokaku, Hodo, and Scribe Naoyasu. Since there were matters concerning silver coins to discuss, Hoshō, Tsunekiyo, Kunishi, and Sueshū were requested to join the small meeting. The monthly duty officers Narahisa and Nobuho were absent as they had gone out to the mountains. Hoshō declined due to being very busy at this time. Kunishi had gone to Kyoto. Gakken made the announcement at the meeting place.

1. Regarding the matter previously discussed, one kanme of silver was borrowed from Maruya Zenbei, and while the interest was paid last winter, the promissory note was valid until the eleventh month of last year. They are now requesting repayment. While the discussion concluded this was reasonable, since funds are currently depleted, it was decided to revise the promissory note and handle the matter through direct negotiation.

1. Regarding Kiage and Eikei, while the principal was repaid last winter, the interest has not yet been settled, leading to repeated demands for payment. Should funds be raised to make repayment? The head priest said that since funds are currently depleted, perhaps two or three people should visit them to ask for forbearance for a little while longer. While the discussion found this reasonable, since this silver matter is particularly important, it was decided to ask for a temporary delay and make repayment as soon as funds could be arranged. This matter will be communicated to both meeting places.

1. Regarding the roving flower assistant performers previously discussed and ordered, since negotiations with the temple lecture group could not be concluded, a petition was made to the shrine, and orders were issued from the shrine to the festival officials. Although they had served as assistant performers for ten years and requested exemption this year, it was decided that this year would be no different and ten people would continue to serve as assistant performers as before. Furthermore, regarding the sake offering, instead of the temple lecture group sending it the following day, it would be sent the day before with fish accompaniment added. This decision was communicated to both sides, and the festival officials were pleased.

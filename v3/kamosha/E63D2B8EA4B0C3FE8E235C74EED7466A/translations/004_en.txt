- Regarding the festival dance that the Umegasuji-chō administrators had previously requested: although they were instructed to continue the dance as before this year, they petitioned that if the dō-kōchū (temple association) could provide sake money, they would gladly perform, but otherwise they are in financial difficulty and request exemption. In response, instructions were given to the temple group that ten dancers should discuss the matter, and if they cannot reach agreement among themselves, the shrine association will issue directives and provide sake money and other support.

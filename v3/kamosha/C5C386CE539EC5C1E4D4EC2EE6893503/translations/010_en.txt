Next, the white horse is brought across to the sacred courtyard (this also begins with Kataoka Shrine)
　The ceremony proceeds as follows: the stable administrator arrives at the sacred horse stable before cockcrow and
　summons various officials including the groom and below to perform the single offering ceremony. At the urging of shrine attendants,
　the groom performs the role of tail rope handler (served by the head priest's attendant) and leads the white horse
　from the first torii to the south of Hashimoto Shrine. At this time, Taguchi
　receives it and leads it across the stone bridge, then from in front of the tower gate across the jeweled bridge
　to present it at Kataoka Shrine. Crossing Kataoka Bridge, from the gate of the new shrine
　it is led in through the eastern gate. Near the board screen, clan members receive it and
　present it before the deity, passing through the standing sand area and turning the horse's head toward the divine presence.
　At this time, the senior attendant of the sacred horse grass (employing one young girl) comes out to feed it with fodder rice (washed
　rice) (placed in the sacred container, overseen by the head priest). Afterward, it is led down and exits through the middle gate to the tower gate,
　crosses the jeweled bridge and western side bridge, exits through the second torii, and
　returns to the stable via Nara Bridge

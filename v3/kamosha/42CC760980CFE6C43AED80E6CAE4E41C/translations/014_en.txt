　　Matters concerning the approach to offer prayers at the altar
First, regarding the timing on the festival day: When the Konoe messenger's ceremonial procedures are completed, one person in suō robe and two hakuchō attendants come from the Administrator. At this time, no celebratory sake is served. At this time, they also bring the viewing box.
The Deputy Administrator wears formal attire: pure white robe, collar robe, plain silk, pointing hakama, standing eboshi hat, and moto-hiro fan. However, all use items from one's own possession. In ancient times there were colored waist sashes and colored dew ornaments, but these are not used recently. Two copies of prayer words (prepared in advance) are placed in the viewing box. Accompanying attendants: one person in suō robe (carries the viewing box, at least to the shrine grounds), two hakuchō attendants (one carries footwear, one carries umbrella). Passing through the front of the bathhouse, the boundary fence, the third torii gate, etc., entering through the second torii gate and approaching the shrine grounds to wait for the horse racing. At that time, one copy of the prayer words (read by the head priest at the bridge hall) is handed to the Administrator. However, after this is finished, it is returned from the Administrator to the Deputy Administrator. Also, the suspended forehead protector (made from wisteria vine bark) - like the riders, this is prepared and offered by the shrine attendants. After the horse racing is finished, when the riders approach the sacred hall, they proceed from the shrine grounds to the sacred hall. The procedure is: first, two shrine attendants carry torches and arrow-swords, etc., with the viewing box going ahead. Most importantly, before this, all three shrine attendants should be summoned and stationed at the shrine grounds. The arrow-sword bearer is often a representative. The Deputy Administrator puts on footwear, exits through the back gate, and proceeds to the junction of the sacred path. After each of the horse racing participants has advanced, he then proceeds forward. The riders ascend via the sacred hall path, dismount and line up in formation facing east with north as the upper direction. However, facing north and west, when the Deputy Administrator advances, they kneel. The Deputy Administrator ascends via the sacred hall path, climbing from the middle section and proceeding to the front of the temporary pavilion. Although some people proceed directly via the sacred hall path, because horses and such are present there, recently it has become the practice to advance from the middle section as described. At about three ken (approximately 18 feet) in front of the pavilion, he takes out the prayer words from the viewing box, removes the outer wrapping, and places them in his breast pocket. However, at this location, the viewing box carrier and accompanying attendants are kept waiting. The two shrine attendants with torches both advance to the front of the pavilion. Also, in case of rain, the person in suō robe holds an umbrella. From there, he advances and stands about one and a half ken in front of the pavilion and makes one bow. Since the pavilion faces southeast, the Deputy Administrator faces northwest and makes one bow.
Next, he places the moto-hiro fan in his breast pocket, takes out the prayer words, removes the ceremonial paper (however, the ceremonial paper is held layered beneath after opening the prayer words), and opens the prayer words (however, opening them shifted slightly to the left side). Next, he raises them to eye level and signals to the riders. At that time, each rider prostrates themselves flat. At this time, he approaches slightly and reads them. After finishing, he rolls them up as initially (however, shifted slightly to the left side) and places them in his breast pocket. Holding the moto-hiro fan, he makes one bow and immediately withdraws. However, the shrine attendants are sent back from around the shrine grounds. In this sequence, he receives one copy of prayer words, etc. from the Great Circuit official and the Administrator present at the shrine grounds and returns. Sometimes both copies are returned on a later day. At the office building, sacred offerings

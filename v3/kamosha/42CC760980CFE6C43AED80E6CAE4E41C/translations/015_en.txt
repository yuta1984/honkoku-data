Direct meeting (naori) {{Recently, they do not take seats and leave early}}
{{Regarding the Deputy Administrator's approach to the sacred hall, in ancient times he would advance to the altar before the riders, and would withdraw after seeing the riders advance to the inner area, but recently he advances later and withdraws first}}

First, regarding the Deputy Administrator reciting prayers at the sacred hall, there are deeply secret oral transmissions. Sometimes one copy of the prayer words that the head priest reads at the bridge hall is handed to the Administrator on the previous day or on the morning of the day itself. However, it is not appropriate to hand over the secret prayer words in advance. Moreover, having the person in suō robe carry the viewing box as they proceed attracts the attention of many people, so sometimes they put it in the viewing box and send it to the shrine grounds at the Administrator's convenience. This too may be inappropriate.

On the day itself, a notice is given regarding the timing {{around the hour of the dragon (7-9 AM)}}.

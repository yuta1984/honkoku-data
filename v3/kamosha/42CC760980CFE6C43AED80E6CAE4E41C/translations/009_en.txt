　　Hōreki 11th year, First month

1. Regarding the manner of posting the notice: It is posted at the hour of the Tiger at dawn on the 11th day. On the night of the 10th, since the Shoshi-dayū holds the court meal at the office building, arrangements are made to give notice at an appropriate time after completion, and preparations for mounting paste and other necessities are arranged. Upon notice of the appointed time, one puts on ritual white robes, carries the notice document in one's breast, and goes to the office building. First, one knocks at the southern entrance of the room next to the retreat quarters and informs the Shoshi-dai duty head that one has come for posting the notice, then proceeds to the office building. One waits for the headmen to come out. Although all five should come out, recently it has been abbreviated to one or two attendees. Once the headmen come out, the notices are posted in order starting from Kawakami-gō, with north as the upper direction, north of the center pillar on the western side of the office building's long horizontal beam. There are traces of yearly postings. After finishing the posting, celebratory sake is served with pine and plum delicacies at the retreat quarters. Additionally, retired mirror cakes from Nara Shrine are received and carried in one's breast, and one withdraws after the celebration is completed.

《Marginal note: According to Kōken's transmission, it is good to return immediately after finishing the posting. It is the rule that one cannot rewrite once one has returned as far as the gate of Jūrakuji Temple.》

On the 11th day's court meal, the Shoshi-dai attends the seating. According to ancient law, if there are discrepancies in the posted notice, correction patches should be applied to revise the writing. For this purpose, paper identical to the notice document is cut into pieces about the size of one person's name, and paste and writing implements are prepared. After the court meal seating is completed, the representatives of the five villages each take back their village's posted notice. Later, the representatives return them to the Shoshi-dai. Return

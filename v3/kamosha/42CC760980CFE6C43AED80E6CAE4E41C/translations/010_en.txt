　　First Day of the Monkey - Ujigami Festival
1. All details are recorded in the section on the frost month (November), therefore abbreviated here.

　　Regarding the Great Procession of the Festival
1. The grouping method is as follows: In the Aoi section, thirteen family retainers (keishi) are recorded, and sixteen or more including deputies (azukari), stewards (bettō), and poetry officials (uta-yaku), listed in order of seniority. The Administrative Officer (Shoshi-dayū) is recorded as the sixteenth person regardless of age. The Deputy (mokudai) is recorded separately at the end, so is excluded from this count. For the Administrator (shoshi), "Shoshi-dayū" is written without adding a separate name. For the others - head family retainers, stewards, and poetry officials - only names are written. If there are absences or impediments among the family retainers, deputies, stewards, poetry officials, etc., they are excluded, making it fifteen or fourteen people. The number depends on availability. However, even if the Administrator or Deputy has impediments or absences, they are written as "Shoshi-dayū" or "Honored Deputy" as customary. Also, when there are many impediments among the three offices of family retainers and fewer people than usual, substitute names are written for those with impediments among the three offices, with small characters like "Deputy Representative," "Steward Representative," or "Poetry Official Representative" written at the shoulder.

Sand, First Elder, Eighth Elder, Boat, Second Elder, Ninth Bridge, Third Elder, Tenth Elder, Road, Fourth Elder, Eleventh Person, Wild Goose Teeth, Fifth Elder, Twelfth Person, Wipe, Sixth Elder, Thirteenth Person, Pine Plant, Seventh Elder, Fourteenth Person. In this way, two people each are allocated among the lodge elders. Those with impediments are examined in advance and excluded, family retainers, deputies, stewards, poetry officials, etc. are excluded, and the remainder is divided into seven groups. If the numbers are uneven, the extras are added one person at a time starting from "Earth." The division method is like dividing into five villages as recorded in the duty head's diary, determining in order from the First Elder by household rank, deciding how many people go to "Sand" and up to "Boat," and writing in order of seniority. 《Marginal note: In Kōken's transmission, lodge elders》《Marginal note: Though it says to write others besides the two people by household rank, now it is different》If among those from First Elder to Fourteenth Person there are family retainers of the three offices, that person is recorded in the Aoi section, and the lodge elder positions are moved up in order. However, when there are sons of the three offices' family retainers, the sons are recorded in the Aoi section and the father is written in the lodge elder position.

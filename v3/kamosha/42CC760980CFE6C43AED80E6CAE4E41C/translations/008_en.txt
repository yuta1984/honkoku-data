1. Although there is a distinction between "kami (governor)" and "zenji (former governor)" among provincial governors, according to recent practice, all are written as "kami."

1. Previously, shoulder notes such as "ko (child)," "tei (younger brother)," "dōko (same child)," and "dōtei (same younger brother)" were written individually, but recently, after consultation with senior members, they are only added when someone reaches three years of age for the first time. If the eldest son follows after his father, "ko" is written; if the second son follows after his elder brother, "tei" is written. Except for the first time, shoulder notes are omitted. 《Marginal note: However, this has been the practice since Kanpō 3rd year》

1. According to Yasutane's transmission: "If a person from the substitute rice fields (shikaeда) holds the rank of provincial governor or official position, their name should be written as is. For bathhouse notices as well, those who serve days in the substitute rice fields have their names written in their proper seats. Those who do not serve days are completely excluded."

1. According to the same transmission: "When there are conflicts among the representatives, a substitute should be written. This should be written in the original person's seat. There is no concern about the substitute's seat."

1. Previously, receive from the Shoshi-dayū ten small folded papers for the dancers and six sheets of Sugihara paper for circular documents, etc. 《Marginal note: Particularly, more than seventy sheets of Sugihara paper are needed by the time of the horse race, therefore one should receive either a full book or half book as convenient》. Then write up the dancers' names, inquire about seating arrangements within the seating group, and after deciding, prepare the horse dispatch circular, riding attendants, elder tokens, etc. 《Marginal note: There are ceremonial paper outer wrappings, write according to old document formats》.

Horse Dispatch Circular

　Head Priest
　Senior Miko
　Senior Hafuri
　Assistant Miko
　Assistant Hafuri
　Kataoka Negi
　Kataoka Hafuri

Regarding the matter of dancers at the ujigami festival on the upcoming [date]:
　First position　　Kamo Agata-nushi [name]
　――　　　　　　――――――
　Tenth position　　――――――
The above circular document is as stated.
　Era name, 11th month, [day]

Particularly regarding the dancers' appointment documents, in old document formats it appears as "San'i Kamo Agata-nushi [someone]," but the two characters "San'i" are inappropriate, so after consultation with seniors, they have been removed in recent times.

After both documents are completed, they are handed to the Shoshi-dayū. Alternatively, regarding the horse dispatch circular, on the day itself in the evening, a shrine attendant receives one wooden tablet at the Shoshi residence, comes to collect it for the Shoshidai, brings it to the horse grounds, and after the marking is completed, brings it to the Shoshidai 《Marginal note: Sometimes it is returned by the Shoshi on a later day》. The dancers' appointment document is collected by the Shoshi-dayū and brought to the head priest's residence; after the dancers' addition ceremony is completed, it is brought to the Shoshidai when the Shoshi returns home 《Marginal note: Sometimes it is returned on a later day》.

The fourth month ujigami festival follows the same procedures as above.

After finishing writing the above, he presents it to the seated officials. At this time, pairings are made. Following the instructions, numbers one-one, two-two up to ten are attached above the names, then a clean copy is made on vertical paper. As follows:
One - Saemon no suke Shigenobu
One - Iki no kami Aidaira
Two - Mino no kami Yasusuke
Two - Sahyōe no suke Hidehisa
Three - Tachi no tō saemon Kiyogu
Four - Minbu no shōyū Seigen
Three - Uhyōe no jō Yasutake
Four - Higashiichi no kami Yasushi
Five - Hyōbu no jō Yasuki
Five - Chiyomatsu dayū Kiyoka
Six - Tango no kami Kiyoyoshi
Six - Chikara no suke Yasudai
Seven - Shūnin no kami Yasuaki
Seven - Genba no jō Ujiyoshi

However, when among the twenty riders one family is serving at the seat, a junior official from that group is sent for, the above matter is communicated, and it is requested that a suitable person be selected from their retainers to participate. First that person is excluded, and a person of suitable rank is included in the pairing to prepare the ceremony for that day. This is ancient practice. There was such an example in Shōhō 3rd year.

Notification: Regarding riders for the coming 5th day
First pair: Left - Saemon no suke Shigenobu | Right - Iki no kami Aidaira
Second pair: Left - Mino no kami Yasusuke | Right - Hyōe no suke Hidehisa  
Third pair: Left - Tachi no tō saemon Kiyogu | Right - First generation Uhyōe no jō Yasutake, moving up right
Fourth pair: Left - Minbu no shōyū Seigen, moving down left | Right - Higashiichi no kami Yasushi
Fifth pair: [blank] | [blank]
[remaining entries blank]

The above notification document is as stated
Shōhō 3rd year, 4th month, [day]

Sometimes it is written "Notification: Coming 5th day of 5th month," but generally the fifth month is not written. Also, while some say "The above designated document is as stated" may be written instead of "The above notification document is as stated," few people write it this way recently. The date should be written as "4th month, day." There are examples of writing "5th month, day" but this is considered incorrect.

The dots are not present when it concerns today. These are dots that conceal the clean copies of left and right sides during the lineup ceremony.
The ceremonial paper and outer wrapping use the same paper.

After finishing the clean copy above, the ceremonial paper and outer wrapping are prepared and the paired document is placed on top of a three-legged offering stand, positioned to the left of the three sake cups.

Regulatory Document
1. Among the shrine families of this shrine, those who unavoidably serve in duties or public service, or reside elsewhere, shall observe the two-season day count of 120 days according to ancient law.
　　　However, counting from New Year's Day through the large and small months, the completion of 120 days constitutes the spring day count. Counting from the end of the eighth month through large and small months until New Year's Eve, the completion of 120 days constitutes the autumn day count. Furthermore, although notification was given that spring day counts should be established, when the shoshi-taifu travels elsewhere for private business after reaching the halfway point of the required days, the practice of stopping the spring day count and switching to autumn day count shall be discontinued henceforth.

Excerpts from the Annual Events of the Three Groups
1. Regarding the articles established when the three groups assembled at the council chamber on the last day of the ninth month of Kyōhō 3rd year: it was decided that those who fail to attend three meetings must provide one barrel of sake. At that time, even if they are retainers, those who are off-duty should be treated the same as those in the group who are on duty for attendance.

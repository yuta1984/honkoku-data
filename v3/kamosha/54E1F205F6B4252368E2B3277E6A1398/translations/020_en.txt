The local and monthly magistrate officials shall attend and decide matters regarding the rotation of rice field assignments.

The details above are due to complaints brought to the shrine community regarding the rotation of rice field assignments between younger and older members. For the future, we establish regulations that younger and older members shall alternate in different years. Also, in recent years, there have been those who travel back and forth on business to other places and then perform rice field rotations, so these regulations are for examining such cases.
As stated above.

Kanbu 10th year, 8th month, 27th day - Shrine Community

During the aforementioned Kanbu period, the shojin-gashira (purification head) was executed around the age of thirty. Therefore, until age fifty-five, with intervals of several years, the shrine families prospered according to their traditional hierarchy, but presently the shojin-gashira already reaches fifty years of age. When following the written instructions above, it would be only about five years. Therefore, it is reasonable that both old and young have the same wishes. Henceforth, those sixty-five and under shall be considered young members, and those above that age shall be considered elders. If in future years the shojin-gashira returns to the conditions of the Kanbu period, the rice field rotations should also be revised according to that year's circumstances. Other regulations shall remain as previously established.
As stated above.

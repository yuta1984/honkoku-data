...serve elsewhere.

Currently, there are 110 people who receive these reciprocal fields. Of these, 18 people currently serve concurrently in positions such as imperial palace attendants, court attendants, non-chamberlain intermediary roles for the Northern Guards, and various retainer positions in noble houses. As initially stated, since these are minor shrine families, they cannot sustain themselves without the shrine's consideration, so the shrine officials of the Seven Houses, head shrine officials, and uji-jin have traditionally served in concurrent positions.

1. How many uji-jin without stipends are there?

Currently, there are 322 uji-jin without stipends who are three years of age or older.

1. Regarding the consultation records from Kyōhō 6 (1721), when the shrine decided through consultation to distribute reciprocal fields to ten people per year, establishing written regulations with the shrine seal - these consultation records exist within the shrine community and should be submitted.

These shrine community records were created when the shrine officials of the Seven Houses, head shrine officials, and uji-jin held meetings. Each time, they consulted with officials, and after everyone's understanding and deliberation was completed, the documents were sealed and stored. Therefore, the shrine's general representative brings them on this occasion.

1. How much borrowed silver does the shrine community currently have?

Regarding borrowed silver, borrowing is conducted through written agreements signed jointly by shrine officials and uji-jin, so the shrine's general representative brings the relevant documents.

Kami-Kamo [Upper Kamo Shrine]

The above is as stated. End.

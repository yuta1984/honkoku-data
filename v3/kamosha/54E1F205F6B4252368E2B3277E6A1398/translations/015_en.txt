There are documentary proofs that the full complement of 140 people was maintained during the Genroku and Hōei eras as well. From around Hōei 5-6 (1708-1709), deaths and vacancies continued to occur year after year, and thereafter the full complement of 140 people was never maintained. Therefore, we stated it began around the Hōei period. Furthermore, regarding the period before Tenna, while there are no records documenting year by year that 140 people were maintained, there are privately kept documents within the shrine families from the Kan'ei period, and it appears that reciprocal fields were received as vacancies occurred.

1. From Bunmei and Tenshō through the Hōei period, historical ancient documentary proofs showing that 140 people were maintained have been transmitted among the uji-jin (shrine parishioners). These documents should be submitted.

We respectfully present for your examination the historical documentary proofs showing that 140 people were maintained, along with an attached catalog.

1. What circumstances led to the creation of the Enpō 8 Report?

The aforementioned report refers to when, in Enpō 7 (1679), the shrine's general representatives went down to Edo to express gratitude for the shrine's repair. The shrine and temple magistrates Matsudaira Yamashiro-no-kami and Itakura Iwami-no-kami made inquiries through an official list, ordering that detailed written responses be submitted. After returning, the shrine officials of the Seven Houses, the head shrine official, and the uji-jin each participated in deliberations over several months before compiling the document, which was submitted in the same year's 8th month to the general representatives [marginal note: Hayashi Shume and Yamamoto Tamba]. The draft of this document exists within the shrine community, and the shrine's general representative brought it on this occasion. The original copy held by the uji-jin is also presented for your examination.

1. How many people currently receive reciprocal fields, and of these, how many serve elsewhere...

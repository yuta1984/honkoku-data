Regulations Regarding Ōraiden Duties
　　　The details are as follows: Among the shrine parishioners of this shrine, 140 people have traditionally served shrine duties at the Ōraiden since ancient times. However, in recent years, it has become difficult to perform duties such as arranging shifts before the deity and other shrine services. Therefore, following precedent, consultations were held, and it was unanimously decided by the entire shrine that in the Uedama area, ten people at a time should serve in age order as has been customary. Accordingly, the following articles are established:

1. From now on, even those who are in service elsewhere or reside in other places must each perform the shrine duties that those worthy of participating in Kibune shrine visits and other appropriate attendance have traditionally carried out.

1. For those serving in other provinces, daily shrine attendance and shrine duties may be determined at discretion. However, those who have not visited the shrine for ten years or more must, according to the previous written directive, serve as regular attendees for three years.

Records of the Deputy Administrator
Kyōhō 13th year, Head Priest Shigetō (Deputy Administrator's official title, ceremonial court attendance)

Item: Today, regarding the matter of the jōjiri stipend silk. The retainer below the steps wears a suō robe and is sent to collect it. From around the middle period, there have been instances where shrine families, both high and low ranking, came to receive it. Previously, there was a person called "peasant messenger" (hyakushō-bu), and there are written records stating that this messenger role involved bringing items from the head priest to those below the steps. This peasant messenger position was the responsibility of the Narifusa family according to the records. Narifusa was the ancestor of the current Naritoshi. It appears that this family would dispatch the peasant messenger to collect from the head priest and then send him to deliver to those below the steps. This messenger position was also discontinued and no longer exists now. It existed until before the Kanbun era. However, in recent years, as mentioned above, retainers below the steps wearing suō robes are sent to collect, and Mori Tsuruhisa, Okamoto Yasutaka, and the current Hayashi Shigetō also handed it over to those wearing suō robes until last year, but this year they say it should not be handed over to those wearing suō robes. (The rest omitted)

Hōgen 3rd year (1158), March 27th
　Five horse races were held at Kitano Shrine on the Ukon-no-baba (Right Guards' riding ground). The names of the racing teams, left and right riders, and horse colors were all recorded. On March 28th of the same month, there were seven horse races for court nobles, all of which were recorded in detail.

Since the Ashi horses were declining, we made a perpetual donation for these horse expenses. Previously, when His Excellency the Taikō borrowed horses, they were stationed at the Ashi horse grounds. His Excellency the Taikō expressed his intention to borrow one more horse. When this was announced to all the senior and junior members, considering the public reputation,

　it was decided to graciously lend the horse. Through consultation among all senior and junior members, it was decided that His Excellency's horse would be stationed at Yamato-bumi, and the Ashi horse at Kanazu. Although the shrine administrator raised various objections, it was decided by unanimous consultation that one horse would be stationed with the shrine administrator, and was immediately stationed at Yamato-bumi. The Ashi horse was supposed to be stationed at the information office, but this imperial horse was moved up and stationed at Kanazu. For the riders, the person riding at Yamato-bumi had been predetermined as Shuzenshō, but upon consideration, since all senior and junior members were arranging the hiring, we decided to ride at Yamato-bumi. Shinkichi rode at Kanazu, so father and son rode at Yamato-bumi and Kanazu respectively. This was celebrated by all members. His Excellency the Taikō also gave his approval.

　The two riders for the second horse race 《Left: Gon no suke Banhisa｜Right: Uneme no suke Sanhisa》 was a rare occurrence in recent years. However, there was precedent in the first year of Tenbun era. There were circumstances regarding this matter, and there were separate instructions, but there was no proper guidance. There were various discrepancies.

Bunroku 2nd year
　In the horse race, Minbu no jō Ujiei was to perform the ceremonial first ride, but his mother died at dawn on the fourth day. When the old and young gathered to discuss the matter, there had never been such a case since ancient times. He should have ridden wearing purification robes, but since no one could ride in light mourning dress, it was decided that Uchinomyō Kuranosuke would ride.

　There were opinions that the seating order was inappropriate, but since it was an urgent matter and would not set a precedent for the future, Kuranosuke rode according to written agreement. This was an unprecedented case with no prior examples. However, there were rumors that it went against heavenly principles due to filial impiety.

May 5th
　His Excellency the Regent visited. For the three-race series, only the first race was held, and from the second race onward, competitions were held up to the stirrup-polishing ceremony. The community offered five loads of sake barrels, sea bream, one hundred bundles of rice dumplings, and fifty steamed buns, whereupon the sake barrels and rice dumplings were immediately bestowed upon the community.

　　　Left: Ōmi-no-kami Yasukado
　Fourth round
　　　Right: Hyōgo-no-suke Tsuguaki

【Both left and right receiving salary rewards on foot】
Both left and right riders fell from their horses, and both horses ran away freely. Although they waited for a while, not knowing where the horses went, they completed the ritual reward ceremony on foot. This goes against ancient customs. In such situations, one should borrow other horses to ride and perform the reward ceremony. The right rider's runaway horse was reportedly brought back at night in Kyoto's Teramachi district.

　　　Right: Chikara-no-kami Ujitatsu

Both left and right riders fell from their horses, and because both horses were in poor condition, both sides led only the horses up while the riders walked up on foot.

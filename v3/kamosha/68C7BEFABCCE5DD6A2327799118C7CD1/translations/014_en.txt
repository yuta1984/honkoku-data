　　　　　Regarding Artemisia (Mugwort) and Sweet Flag
One: In the fifth month of Tenpyō 9, an imperial edict was issued stating that all court officials and people must wear sweet flag garlands (kazura), and those who do not wear them shall not be permitted to enter the imperial palace. The Kōnin-shiki also states that on the third day of the fifth month at dawn, sweet flag and mugwort are to be placed in front of the Southern Hall, as recorded in the "Kuji Kongen." According to "Shūi," on the fourth day of the fifth month, the Bureau of the Imperial Palace had sweet flag placed on the roofs of the palace buildings. A poem by Provisional Middle Counselor Kimio reads:
　　When we say "today," only sweet flag is added to thatch
　　At this dwelling of mugwort fallen upon the eaves

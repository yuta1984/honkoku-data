Ujinaga's horse ran to the reverse racecourse, and Suemasa won. After a while,
　　　　　　Ujinaga ran alone.
[From the same records]
《Interlinear note: [Above]｜》First race　3rd year of Eiroku, 5th month, 5th day
[Case of falling from horse after whipping and re-entering]
　　　　　　　　Left　Master of the Palace Table, Sadenori
　　　　　　Seventh race
　　　　　　　　Right　Assistant of Military Affairs, Tsugunao
　　　　　　It is questionable that Sadenori fell from his horse after whipping it in pursuit and then re-entered, etc.
[Written in red ink]《Interlinear note: In my opinion｜　　This should be considered a loss. Falling from horse after whipping and re-entering is the height of carelessness》
　　　First race　1st year of Kan'ei, 5th month, 5th day

[Case of losing by not re-entering when should have re-entered from the steps below]
　　　　　　　　Left　Master of the Left Gate Guards, Yasueda
　　　　　　Fifth race
　　　　　　　　Right　Assistant Master of the Palace, Narihide
　　　　　Narihide's horse was an inner horse and the whip didn't work, so although there was a message that he should
　　　　　re-enter once more from the steps below, since Narihide returned to his residence, it became a loss,
　　　　　and the Master of the Left Gate Guards' horse was superior (probably ran and won (written in red)), etc.
　　　First race　1st year of Kanbun, 5th month, 5th day
[Case of居負け (staying put and losing)]
　　　　　　　　Left　Governor of Hōki, Chūken　《Interlinear note: Won by running alone upon the signal voice｜》
　　　　　　Sixth race

　　　　　　Eighth race
　　　　　　　　Right　Assistant Governor of Buzen, Mizunao　《Interlinear note: Lost by being late, and lost even more decisively because his cap fell off, etc.｜》

Left's Fukuhisa headed toward the barrier in front of the temporary shrine and tightened the reins with his right hand, so before crossing the barrier and taking his seat,
he rode in and immediately fell from his horse. Right also followed and entered but did not fall. Left withdrew to the west and returned, then immediately galloped.
Right also followed out, but was delayed by several ken. At that time, claiming it was right's loss, the right sent a messenger to the authorities below. The
authorities below on the right side answered, "It is unusual for someone who falls from their horse within the grounds to win. I myself should not
be considered a loss" etc. At that time there were minor objections but it was resolved peacefully.

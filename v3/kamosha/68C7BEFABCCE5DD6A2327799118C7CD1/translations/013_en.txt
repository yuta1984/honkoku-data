Since this record contains many matters with which I am unfamiliar, there will likely be numerous misunderstandings. Therefore, I should gradually adjust it to suit those of understanding and rewrite it cleanly. Moreover, since this is not for others but rather a duty record for my own preparation, its contents are extremely rough and careless.
If there should be anyone who reads this, I am only ashamed that they might seek to ridicule my poor writing.

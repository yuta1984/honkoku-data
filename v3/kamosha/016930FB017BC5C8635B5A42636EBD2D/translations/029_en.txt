3rd day, Kinoto-U, clear: Regarding the adoption of Shinzaburō by the Seo Yahyōe family on the 13th of last month, today I made a courtesy visit wearing formal hemp attire.

6th day, Tsuchinoe-Uma, clear: After lunch, assembled at the shrine for preliminary arrangements for the seventh Kagura gathering. All matters as usual. However, after the death last year of the late Bungo-no-kami Katsusei, financial difficulties arose, and regarding the borrowed silver for the Kagura gathering, in the eleventh month of last winter, the relatives submitted a petition offering one plot of family land in Koyama village, earnestly requesting compassionate consideration. After the officials reviewed this petition last winter, it was discussed today with various consultations, but as Koho was absent and Tekken left early today, the matter remains undecided. It was agreed that a decision should be made by the next accounting period, and everyone departed.

The assembly and announcement for the main event proceeded as usual.

29th day, Kanoe-Tatsu, clear: Today is the day for final arrangements. At the early part of the Snake hour, wearing hemp formal dress and jacket, I brought the fair copy of the middle finger assignments and went to the Chief Administrator's residence. On this occasion, I also brought three documents that had been prepared beforehand: the circuit for the New Year's Day horse racing, the circuit for special items, and the kana spear decisions, and handed them to the Chief Administrator. After the seated officials Kyōshō and Kyōi arrived and the assembly was complete with those wearing formal dress and jackets, I first took out the fair copy of the middle finger assignments, removed the ceremonial paper and outer wrapping, presented it to the seated officials, and made the courtesy inquiry whether there would be another examination. After their review, they said it was acceptable, so I spread it out on the left side.

To prepare the assignment slips for the 5th day, I first wrote the left side. Writing each person from first to tenth group individually, I placed a mark on the upper character of each person's name in the middle finger fair copy, and after finishing, presented it to the seated officials. Next, for the right side, I did the same and placed marks on the lower characters. After both documents were reviewed by the seated officials without discrepancies, ceremonial paper and outer wrapping were added to each, with "left side" and "right side" written on the outer wrapping. The "right side" was written one character space lower.

After this business was completed, both documents were placed on the left side of the single-cup three-legged tray that was on the floor. After scattering the inkstone and writing paper, there was a presentation ceremony. There was a three-legged tray with a single cup ⟪marginal note: three times, earthenware⟫, a three-legged tray with standing arrangements of mugwort and iris, ray fish, ceremonial sake ⟪marginal note: warmed sake⟫, and figures of people wearing formal dress without tin additions. Today, following precedent, it began with the Deputy Administrator, then moved to the senior seated officials, and the Chief Administrator received it. Next, small dishes, rice, and ceremonial sake were served as follows:

Grilled dish ⟪marginal note: fresh ray fish⟫  Soup ⟪marginal note: three times with soy sauce, herring roe⟫  White chopsticks ⟪marginal note: Nikko tableware⟫
Boiled dish  Rice
Ceremonial sake, three cups, lacquered hat, small bowl, inkstone lid ⟪marginal note: octopus, inner board, red ginger⟫
Rice basket ⟪marginal note: grilled conger eel skin⟫  Small bowl  Boiled dish

After this concluded, I put the two assignment slips in my breast and departed. It was past the Horse hour at that time.

○ After the midday meal, there was a meeting of all senior members, which my father attended.

Last day of the month, Kanoto-Mi, clear: Past the late Sheep hour, one attendant in hakama came from the Chief Administrator. However, a document box with aoi crests was requested from the shrine by the Administrator, and today that attendant brought it. Therefore, the two assignment slips for the 5th day were placed in that document box, and for the attendant to carry it, Kyōsen wore ritual robes and court trousers ⟪marginal note: light purple⟫ with a double indigo sash, dressed as a head priest...

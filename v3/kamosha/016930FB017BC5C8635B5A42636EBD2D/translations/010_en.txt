Next, they consulted with Hitsuke and performed the ground ritual according to precedent. Regarding today's matter, Keisen sent two servants, Kanzaburō and Kameshirō, from his household. Additionally, one to (measure) of sake was sent from the three households of Bunkyō, Keimoto, and Keii. For funeral implements, they borrowed a complete set of coffin bearers and other equipment from the local community association's first funeral group, and prepared various other purchased items and implements.

Around the half-hour of the cock, the funeral procession proceeded as usual, so this is omitted here.

However, the aforementioned Uncle, Higo-no-kami (Governor of Higo), Junior Fourth Rank Lower Grade Lord Tsunaoka, served at Ōtsu Enman-in Palace from the age of eleven and was called Kurando-chū.

This sentiment must be preserved even unto our descendants - Lord Tsunaoka's benevolence must never be forgotten.

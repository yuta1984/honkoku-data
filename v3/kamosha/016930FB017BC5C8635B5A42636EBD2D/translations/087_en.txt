Ukon made his first formal visit to the palace today. ○ I requested Teisei to serve as substitute for shrine head duty.

3rd day, Kinoe-Inu, snow - The adopted daughter Ume from Seo Jihei's household, who was received in marriage last June, had circumstances incompatible with the family traditions, so this time Seo's side proposed divorce. Recently, Ume's brother, non-chamberlain Matsumuro Hyūga, finally agreed to this divorce matter. Accordingly, Seo's side sent 30 pieces of white silver to the said Ume as clothing money, and the matter was settled peacefully. Regarding this, today Seo sent me lacquered red soup bowls for ten people, one string of dried squid, etc., as a greeting for having consulted with me privately about this matter. Originally, the Seo household has old obligations to our house, and since their handling of this matter was most considerate, I accepted these items for now.

5th day, Hinoe-Ne, clear - I visited Seo's place and repeatedly declined the items sent recently, but they insisted I accept them as a favor, so I accepted them as offered.

6th day, Hinoto-Ushi, clear - I sent one salted salmon to Seo's place as a greeting for recent matters. ○ Tonight, for Omi-no-kami's first entry visit to the Shingū household (the actual family of his adopted son Ukon), Keisen, Shimohashi Saemon and others were also invited. We departed around the hour of the Cock. Everyone wore formal hemp dress, and from Keisen we sent celebratory gifts: one box of three fans, one fold of side dishes, one fresh sea bream, one package of trumpet shells, and one tray of seven ark shells. I brought along one attendant, Ishimatsu, carrying a box lantern. Namba Bizen-no-kami was also invited and attended the same gathering. After the celebratory sake and cuisine, more sake was served. The event concluded at the hour of the Rat, and I returned home before the hour of the Ox.

13th day, Kinoe-Saru - Light snow in the morning, then clearing. Since I had privately handled all arrangements for Horikawa Omi-no-kami's adopted son Ukon's succession petition, Gōshū sent 500 pieces of gold as hakama fabric money today as a greeting. ○ One ryō of silver was delivered from Katoshi as a greeting for the three-group diary duties. ○ The noble households conducted their customary year-end cleaning.

20th day, Kanoto-U, clear - Setsubun (seasonal division). Taking ages: the household elder is 80 years old, Keisen is 42 years old, Keiki is 12 years old.

21st day, Mizunoe-Tatsu, cloudy - Rain fell in the evening. Since Horikawa Gōshū's adopted son received his first court rank the day before yesterday on the 19th and the succession petition was completed, as celebration for the completion: one box of three fans, one barrel of sake (3 kin)

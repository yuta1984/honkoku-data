[that this request] be granted as wished, I earnestly request your kind intervention and favorable consideration. Above stated.

Bunsei 12, Year of the Ox, 9th Month - Kondō Oribe (seal)
To Lord Shimohashi Samon
To Lord Fujikake Kura

Both of the above petitions were submitted to Shimohashi, who was on duty.

9th Day, Kōshi, Clear - The Goke-mon's Double Ninth Festival celebration proceeded as in previous years.

11th Day, Mizunoe-Tora, Clear - Regarding Horikawa Danjō's illness and his request to retire from Goke-mon service, and consequently my youngest son Chishirō's petition to succeed to the family name, due to the convenience of both parties, the matter was decided as requested at the senior retainers' office, as conveyed by Yasuda Tōtōmi-no-kami. The announcement was made accordingly. Therefore, I immediately dressed in hemp formal wear and, accompanied by Goshoku-bantō Shimohashi Samon, went before His Lordship to express gratitude. However, since the person in question is still very young, he was excused from this formal thanks. Subsequently, similar thanks were offered at the Young Lord's residence, and notifications were made in order to the stewards, close attendants, junior samurai, and the inner quarters. Furthermore, upon leaving, still in hemp formal wear, courtesy calls were made to the residences of senior retainers and above-ranking close attendants, with calling cards presented. The written notice was as follows. Returned home at evening; this was the first time Yasuko was informed of this matter.

Calling Card:
This time, regarding Horikawa Danjō's family name
succession by youngest son Chishirō,
the petition has been granted
as requested. Grateful thanks. - Kondō Oribe

13th Day, Kinoe-Tatsu, Clear - Regarding Chishirō's succession to the Horikawa family name being granted as petitioned, fresh seafood offerings (one conger eel, red clams for Tanabata) were presented in gratitude, accompanied by bantō-dai Nari■'s congratulations before His Lordship. However, this was done in regular clothing. Additionally, regarding the same matter, as a greeting to both bantō Shimohashi and Fujikake, both Danjō and I sent two shu of sake money.

14th Day, Kinoto-Mi, Clear - With Chishirō's Horikawa succession matter concluded, various sake gifts of two shō were sent to Horikawa Ōmi-no-kami as greetings. Regarding his financial debt matter, a meeting was convened at the lodging with Lord Inomoto, Ogawa Shōsuke, Kawai Kurōdo and others participating. After thorough discussion, the matter was concluded and everyone dispersed.

15th Day, Hinoe-Uma, Clear Weather - As is customary, the Kyō family gathering took place at Kyōken Pavilion, with the usual morning meal assembly as in previous years.

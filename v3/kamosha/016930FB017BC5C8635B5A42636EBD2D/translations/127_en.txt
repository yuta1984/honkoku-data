This matter was brought to box consultation from the standing meeting. The response was that it was acknowledged in the discussion. Next, according to Naoichi's speech, regarding when impoverished people among the Koyama annual rotation request advance silver payments, while the interest has been one-and-a-half bu until now, since this is a time when kōgin and other funds are being lent to other regions at about eight or seven shu, regarding silver that must unavoidably be accepted due to the poverty of shrine families under our jurisdiction, one-and-a-half bu is too high interest. If borrowing could be done at about eight shu in the future, this would correspond to compassionate benevolent governance, so he requested that the senior and junior members make such a proposal. In discussion, this was deemed reasonable, but it would be inappropriate to decide with just today's single discussion, so it would be better to make the proposal after a decision at a later meeting. With this, everyone dispersed.

23rd day, Kinoto-Tori (Wood Rooster): Clear. The Great Lord previously submitted a decline regarding the imperial inquiry about personnel numbers, but it was announced the day before yesterday on the 21st that this time the request would be heeded as desired. Therefore, today after attending court, I wore hemp formal wear and expressed gratitude.

26th day, Tsuchinoe-Ne (Earth Rat): Clear. Recently there have been evening thunderstorms and thunder daily in the afternoon. The private birth mother of the Young Lord, Kinuyama, died suddenly tonight around the Tiger hour (4 AM) in the women's quarters. Consequently, one attendant, Mizuguchi Shōsō, was appointed, and this evening after the Rooster hour (past 6 PM) she was taken down to the temple gate of Myōden-ji. Since the connection with the Young Lord is extremely private, there are generally no official notifications, and he observes private mourning in the women's quarters with separate fires from this evening, not appearing in the public areas. Of course, for public duties he is described as being absent due to illness. Therefore, this morning I inquired about the health of both Lords in regular clothes and privately offered condolences. Regarding this, at home there is no need for concern or separate fires.

Meeting Notes

This past ninth month, when Mizuno Dewa-no-kami came to Kyoto, the shrine representatives went to his lodgings to request written authorization for eight laborers and two horses for the annual journey to the Kantō region to present葵 (aoi leaves) as tribute. However, they were told that making such requests to the lodgings was improper procedure, and that if they wished to make such a request, they should petition the magistrate's office. Accordingly, they petitioned the magistrate's office, but after thorough investigation, it was determined that while they claimed to have consulted with the entire shrine community, the representatives and monthly duty officers who should have been mindful of proper procedure failed to do so, bypassing the official offices to petition Mizuno Dewa-no-kami's lodgings directly. This was done under the mistaken belief that since they had traveled to the Kantō region and presented aoi tribute in the Year of the Sheep, such action was acceptable. Due to this misconduct:

Shrine Representatives:
Tomino Ise-no-kami
Horiuchi Sagami-no-kami
Monthly Duty Officers:
Fujiki Suruga-no-kami
Nandairō Shinano-no-suke
Yamamoto Awa-no-kami

All five of these individuals were sentenced to house confinement. Therefore, this matter received official attention. Regarding shrine duties, it was requested that they be carried out through personal representatives due to shrine business. This matter was also officially communicated.

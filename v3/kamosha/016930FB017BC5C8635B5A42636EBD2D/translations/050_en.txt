Uhyōe-no-jō, Minbu, the accounting official Oribe, Shuzen and others went after the Hour of the Horse to complete the inspection and ordered that drawings be submitted. Next, we rested at petitioner Rihei's residence where sake and rice were served, and everyone dispersed in the evening.

September

3rd day, Mizunoe-Uma, cloudy. The sixth session of the three-group lecture was held after lunch at the usual lecture hall, which I attended.

6th day, Kinoto-Tori, cloudy. Regarding austerity measures for the entire shrine community from this ninth month of Tsuchinoe-Inu year until the eighth month of next Tsuchinoto-I year due to this summer's drought damage, there was a circular notice with written records following what was announced during the drought of the sixth year of Bunsei (Hinoto-Hitsuji). When compared with the austerity records from the Hitsuji year, there were slight discrepancies, so I noted these differences in red ink in the Hitsuji year records. ○This year, Raikyōsen serves as tax collection head for Kawakami regular tax. Today I went in formal dress to inform Narutaka, Azukari-bun-shi and others of the annual granary staff that the Kawakami regular tax rice should be delivered to our place on the 8th as usual. For Ichijirō and Ume-no-Saemon in the lower district, I sent the same message through servants. However, since this concerns Kawakami regular tax rice, it should properly be handled through Yatone with individual notifications, but following recent precedent, I handled it only as described above.

7th day, Hinoe-Inu, clear. After lunch there was accounting for the sixth session of the three-group lecture at the lecture hall. Kyōeki, I, Tamihiko, Yashichi and others attended, finishing in about half an hour.

8th day, Tsuchinoto-I, cloudy. This year Kyōsen serves as collection head for Kawakami regular tax, with deliveries made to each household. The rice distribution to head Seiki, Ujimi, and the four intermediaries was managed by Kyōsen as in previous years. Details are recorded in the regular tax intermediary accounting records, so I omit them here. Upon completion, this was forwarded to Chōken. ○There are no preliminary payments for the domain house at present.

9th day, Tsuchinoe-Ne, rain. The Double Ninth festival celebration was as in previous years.

10th day, Tsuchinoto-Ushi, rain. Although Shūshi's first birthday was on the 3rd of this month, the celebration was postponed and held today.

13th day, Mizunoe-Tatsu, clear. Regarding this year's drought-damaged rice fields, after the Hour of the Horse, Naoichi, Shuhitsu, Akira, Kyōsen and others went together, taking Kameshirō along for inspection.

15th day, Kinoe-Uma, clear. As in previous years, the Kyō family gathered to stay at Kyōtoku's, but at elder brother Kyōshō's residence

There was a withdrawal, and Hiroaki was suddenly asked to take on additional duties. He earnestly requested that arrangements be made for the matter of the small folded paper that had been submitted. After finishing the morning meal and returning, I immediately rewrote the duty roster and then arranged my hair and performed ritual ablutions.

After the second large drum was beaten, three attendants came from the Assistant Administrator and offered celebratory sake. The items to be carried included borrowed items from the Fifth Rank group, including vermillion umbrellas and market women's hats. However, this was through the earnest arrangement of the Administrator from beforehand. The items placed in the document box this morning were: two wooden boards, an inkstone, brushes ⟪marginal note: white hair, white shaft⟫, one ink stick ⟪marginal note: however, dragon-shaped, but lacking, so paper⟫ ⟪marginal note: wrapped with twisted paper, tied in three places⟫, five sheets of half-paper ⟪marginal note: for wet paper use⟫, two copies of the horizontally-folded duty roster ⟪marginal note: for use by the two supervisors⟫, and in a document box bearing the double hollyhock crest were two assignment slips for the 5th day and two duty rosters. One copy was placed without礼紙 outer wrapping and without writing the Riding Officer's name. This was for when the Riding Officer would be replaced during court attendance. Additionally, records of the duties of the Deputy Administrator and Riding Officers, and notes on supervisory procedures were included. However, among these items, the inkstone, ink, brushes, wooden boards, etc. came from the Administrator.

When the third large drum was beaten, there was a notification from the Head Priest ⟪marginal note: as usual, from the divine master⟫. Accordingly, I donned ritual robes, court trousers, light-colored eight-fold garments, wisteria-colored waist sash, colored dew ornaments, collar undergarment, red-covered silk court cap, short sword ⟪marginal note: small scabbard, hair ornament⟫, summer fan ⟪marginal note: yellow with black ribs⟫, tabi socks, straw sandals, etc., and assembled at the Head Priest's residence. My attendant was one miscellaneous servant carrying the document box ⟪marginal note: with carrying bag as usual⟫, and white-robed attendants carrying umbrella and shoes. Earlier, Yamato-no-fumi Riding Officer Hiroaki and others had already assembled, and rice gruel was served ⟪marginal note: ray fish, pickled vegetables⟫. Rice and chopsticks followed, then ceremonial sake in three cups, lacquered appetizers ⟪marginal note: dried cod, kelp⟫, and a small portion of mackerel sushi to conclude.

At that time, the Inspector sent Deputy Toshisue to me with an apology, saying that the provisional inspector's document handed over yesterday had been damaged, asking what should be done. When I inquired about the nature of the damage, he said that the names of Lord Matsudaira Suō-no-kami and all the shrine officials below had been written throughout. Kyōsen immediately deliberated and suggested that for the matter of that article's deadline, it would be appropriate to patch it with white paper. When told this would be acceptable, he briefly returned home for the necessary materials and came back safely.

At that time, Head Priest Nobuhira-kyō appeared and took his seat in the center of the next room off the main hall, wearing hunting robes, large-crested garments, and court trousers. To his left and right sat Kyōsen, Hiroaki, Toshisue, Hideaki, Takeuji, and Kyōkō, each in ritual robes and court trousers. However, Deputy Administrator Kyōsen, Yamato-no-fumi Riding Officer Hiroaki, etc., wore wisteria-colored large-crested garments as usual. The Inspector at the end wore court dress. Beginning the wine offering, the Head Priest had a three-legged stand with appetizers ⟪marginal note: dried cod, wakame seaweed⟫, the Deputy Administrator and below had large wooden board appetizers of the same kind, three cups three times, earthenware three-legged stand sake vessels, with the divine master in ritual robes and the master carpenter in formal dress. Starting with the Head Priest, it passed to Kyōsen, then in order to the Inspector, where it concluded. At that time, Kibu-ne-no-ne Yoshi and Riding Officer Hideaki said to the Head Priest, "We should proceed ahead..."

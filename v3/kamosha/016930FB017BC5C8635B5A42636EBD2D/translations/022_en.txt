7th day, kanoe-tora, clear. Regarding the birth of a princess on the 5th of this month to a court lady at the Imperial Palace (daughter of Lord Kanroji), today there was a congratulatory visit from our house to the Young Prince's residence.

○My uncle's (the late Tsuneoka Agata-nushi) eldest grandson Tsunewaka (Yasutoshi's eldest son) died yesterday on the 6th (from smallpox, how regrettable. He was born on the 27th of the 4th month). Immediately today, with Yasutoshi in attendance, they moved to Tsunetake's place, established the retirement residence there as the main residence, and held the funeral this evening. Therefore, Tsunesen left our house in the morning, went directly to Tsunetake's place, took care of everything from beginning to end, participated in the preliminary ground ceremony, and since the aforementioned Tsunewaka had not yet received a formal name, after consultation it was decided to call him Tsuneyasu (however, he was Tsunesen's charge). Naturally, Tsunetō did not participate due to shrine duties. Tsunesen sent ten blocks of tofu to Yasutoshi and dispatched two servants, Kameshirō and Ishimatsu. The funeral procession took place after the hour of the Rooster. Before this, everyone donned their formal dress and, after consultation, organized the funeral procession as follows:

Attendant carrying viewing screen (formal dress), torch and box lantern bearer (formal dress), torch and box lantern bearer (formal dress), long sword bearer (formal dress with sword), bow and arrow bearer (same), incense burner bearer (same), register and sacred sakaki branch with black offerings bearer (white court dress), box lantern bearer (formal dress), coffin (four people in white court dress), shoe bearer (white court dress), group procession.

At the hour of the Dog, Yasutoshi of Sagami immediately departed for Ōtsu, and thereafter everyone dispersed.

11th day, kinoe-uma, clear. It was the turn for monthly prayer service attendance. My father served as substitute. ○After the midday meal, the Second Ban Dengaku Guild held a meeting at Kōhō Pavilion. Those who gathered were Teisei, Kōsei, Kōhō, Funkyō, Daikyō, Senshō, Kenshū, Yasushi and others. The rest did not attend. The purpose was that the collection of loaned silver by the Second Ban Guild has become extremely difficult in recent years, so after today's consultation, they decided to distribute the current silver among the members this time, and from next year forward, they will rotate to appoint one person at a time as leader, have the leader take one to (measure) from the annual rice tribute as sake offering fee, have sake presented as offerings, and the remaining rice will be distributed annually by that leader to all members. They held a drinking session and everyone dispersed after nightfall. The details of this matter are recorded in the group records, so I abbreviate here.

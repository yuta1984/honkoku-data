6th day, Hinoto-I, clear. Due to flood damage in the domain territory last year, a request for borrowed rice from the Kantō region had been submitted since last winter. On April 15th, there was notification from Monthly Duty Courtier Lord Kanroji that 300 koku of borrowed rice had been approved. Since the Deputy Administrator's countersignature was completed yesterday the 5th, today Kyōsen went to Nijō Granary and met with agent Aoyama Gen'emon, informing him that the countersignature for the borrowed rice was complete. Regarding when the rice would be delivered, and that documentation should be brought the day before delivery to exchange with the rice inventory list, in the precedent case of Bunka 5, when we went to inquire about the deadline, we made earnest requests and the documentation and inventory were accepted for exchange. So this time too, when we earnestly requested the same handling, we were told that if we brought the apology document, the exchange could be done today. Thus the exchange was completed, and the rice will be delivered on the coming 14th. This matter was arranged through Kameya, who had privately conveyed the deadline from our side. Also, I privately told Gen'emon that since this was recently ordered, I requested that he please ask the magistrates to ensure it would not be poor-quality rice, to which he agreed. Next, I went to the magistrate's office and met with Satake Sanshirō, expressing gratitude for his various assistance regarding this borrowing request and approval, then returned home. ○Around the Hour of the Rat (midnight), about 1.5 chō of peasant houses in the shrine community district of Yoshida Village burned down.

Item: The elder lord, having long suffered from illness, petitioned for leave from palace service for convalescence. As there was no heir to the family name, my youngest son Chishirō was granted succession to the family name as petitioned, and [the elder lord] accordingly retired from service. Henceforth, regarding Chishirō's status, there shall be no interference whatsoever with official duties. Therefore, I record this matter for posterity. As above stated.
Bunsei 12, Year of the Ox, 9th Month - Kondō Oribe (seal)
To Lord Horikawa Danjō

18th Day, Tsuchinoe-Tori - Due to rotation duty for daily worship at Kifune Shrine, I went on duty from early morning. Ōta performed the first worship at the shrine as usual. Returned home in the morning hours. ○ Regarding the Tōfukuji wealth matter from last year's first month: Keisen at the Ichijō family, to ensure his duties would be free from disaster, through the same year's head person Hissaken, made prayers to the main shrine for seven days. Although afterwards the various persons involved were each reprimanded, Keisen completed his duties without incident and was allowed to continue in his position. Therefore, ceremonial sake should have been offered immediately in gratitude, but from the fifth month Keisen entered deep mourning and this was postponed. Today, with Hissaken on duty, the long-delayed ceremonial thanksgiving sake was offered, with the customary group sake implements. Moreover, when Keisen performed daily worship, he combined this with thanksgiving prayers.

○ At the Seo Jibei residence, there had been a prior agreement regarding an adopted daughter, and tonight she was to be brought from the Matsumuro family. Tsunehitsu left the meeting early and went to the Seo residence after the Hour of the Cock. He brought his attendant Ishimatsu and changed into hemp kamishimo at the Seo residence. Earlier, Seo Yahei, Shinzaburo and others had already gathered, each wearing hemp kamishimo. However, regarding this adoption of the daughter, Tsunehitsu privately sent one hundred taki manjū sweets and one load of wicker baskets to Jibei by promissory note. Around half past the Hour of the Boar, Matsumuro Chikugo (Hyūga's younger brother, serving as representative since Hyūga was indisposed), Keishin-in (the adopted daughter's mother, a woman from Shimogamo Nashinoki), and others arrived bringing the adopted daughter Ume. After a rest, Tsunehitsu introduced Seo's son Genkurō (wearing hemp kamishimo) and the adopted daughter Ume in the sitting room for the wedding ceremony with the ritual of three-three-nine times cups. However, since this was a private affair, there were no lady attendants, and the go-between Tsunehitsu directed everything. After completion and rest, Tsunehitsu introduced Chikugo, Keishin-in and others to the sitting room, where Jibei, Genkurō, Ume, and Tsunehitsu took their main seats. After congratulatory greetings from each, noshi kelp was passed around to everyone, followed by the ritual of binding cups with three cups, with Jibei going first and Tsunehitsu giving directions throughout (this had been arranged beforehand with the clerk taking notes from the adjoining room). The servers throughout were the clerk's wife and kitchen staff. After this concluded, everyone dispersed for a rest, then reassembled with Seo Yahei and Shinzaburo joining. After the two greeted Chikugo and others, noshi kelp was passed to them, followed by zōni soup, then clam soup, then small dishes (sea bream), with sake served in cups for the second round. The third round was also like the first with three cups, beginning with Jibei for the ritual binding cups with Yahei and his son and all present. As before, Tsunehitsu directed everything, and afterward the main meal was served - one soup and three dishes. After tea was served, sweets were brought out, then Ume was taken to the kitchen to be introduced to the clerk's wife and others. After returning to their seats, Tsunehitsu, Chikugo, Keishin-in and others were taken to the kitchen area to meet the clerk's wife and others, then returned to their seats. Next, the final soup course was served. At this time, Genkurō and Ume withdrew privately to the kitchen. It was still before dawn. More sake and delicacies were brought out continuously, and before sunrise the final cups were completed. Everyone then dispersed and Chikugo and Keishin-in departed. Everything proceeded without incident most auspiciously - truly fortunate.

7th day, Kanoto-I, clear - Celebratory gifts arrived from Seo's adopted daughter Ume. For the family elder and Tsunehitsu, one box each of fans (three fans per box), and for Mother and Saya, two bundles each of letter paper. This was as previously arranged.

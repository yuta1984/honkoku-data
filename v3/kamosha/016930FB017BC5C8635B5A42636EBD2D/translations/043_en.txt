This was the reason. My father met with the messenger and acknowledged the intent of the reply that was sent. Since both persons are currently away from home, he said he would still convey this matter to them and returned. Regarding this matter, Kyōsen found it strange and examined about three copies of the Deputy Administrator's duty records, but could not find it in any of the records. So he inquired of one or two others, but they said it was not necessary to pursue the matter. Therefore, when the aforementioned messenger came just as we had parted at Naka-ōji Bridge and returned home today, I immediately went to Kyōshō's place, explained the circumstances, and held consultations. It was concluded that since one would usually accompany to the gate, it would be good to be considerate and understand this as the proper course. Therefore, I went directly to the Head Priest's residence ⟪marginal note: wearing next-level formal dress⟫. I was shown to the inner quarters and met with Lord Shinpei. Regarding this matter, since it was not found in our duty records, I inquired of several people and heard rumors that it was not necessary to pursue the matter, so I had concluded without accompanying to the main gate. However, since you have now sent a messenger, I further inquired of the elders, and indeed according to recent precedent one usually accompanies, so I stated that I hoped you would understand that I should have accompanied today as well. This was quickly acknowledged, and while it was not a matter to insist upon strongly, it was merely to make a thorough inquiry. Therefore, I apologized that not conducting one more level of investigation was due to my misunderstanding and carelessness, and returned home.

○Today the new Head Priest of Higashi Hongan-ji ⟪marginal note: 13 years old⟫ made an appearance and observed the foot-washing ceremony at the sutra hall. This was because a daughter was born to the local clan member, the Resident County Governor, etc.

2nd day, Mizunoto-Hitsuji, clear. From early morning, I prepared two copies of horse assignment notices, left and right, to give to the deputy officials for the 5th day. ○Due to heavy rain on the 20th in Kodera Village of the Domain Lord's territory, over six koku worth of land became wasteland, so a request was made for inspection. Taking along fellow official Kawase Shuzen and the provisions manager, they departed today.

4th day, Kinoto-Mi, clear. After nightfall, I delivered two copies of the horse assignment notice for the 5th day to Deputy Official Hitsaaki. ○After nightfall, Kawase returned to the capital from Kodera Village.

5th day, Hinoe-Inu, clear. Auspicious festival, most precious indeed. Temple duty direct service, general receipts. The divine service was around half past the Hour of the Rabbit (6:30 AM), along with the horse racing meet, all matters as usual. After the third large drum beating, a notification came from the Head Priest that the horse of Shizuori-shō would be changed to chestnut with light mane and tail. There were various apologies for delays, and notices also returned from the deputy officials. Due to this, my father brought paper notices etc. to the shrine and conveyed the above circumstances. Therefore, immediately at the shrine, only the left side of the notice was rewritten, and after a short time, the shrine attendants

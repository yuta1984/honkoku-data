Eighth Month (30 days)

1st day, Tsuchinoe-tatsu: Clear. The Hassaku celebration for the family residence was conducted as in previous years.
4th day, Kanoto-hitsuji: Light rain. Mother and Kyōsen were instructed to visit the grave. Measurements of the stone monument were taken.
6th day, Mizunoto-tori: Cloudy with occasional light rain. Fushimi-no-miya's consort Sumii-gokata (age 32, younger sister of the family residence's great lord) passed away yesterday on the 5th at the hour of the Boar due to illness during pregnancy, as announced this morning. In fact, she passed away on the 1st of this month at the hour of the Dragon. Accordingly, both palaces of the residence will wear provisional mourning for 20 days and full mourning for 90 days. All offered condolences in regular dress. Regarding this, Kōho Agatanushi has maintained separate fire and separate quarters at home since yesterday the 5th. I, being in deep mourning, am not required to observe this. The consort's posthumous Buddhist name is respectfully called Kōjōan-in-den.

7th day, Kinoe-inu: Cloudy. Regarding the matter of inscribing the tombstone surfaces for the late Bunkei Agatanushi and Shūshi, today I consulted with and requested this of Kōho Agatanushi.

9th day, Hinoe-ne: Clear. Due to the death of Kankishin-in-no-miya, from yesterday the 8th through tomorrow the 10th, a three-day cessation of musical instruments is officially observed. ○ I had someone visit the grave of the late Kondō Kyūma at Sanpōji temple. However, this had been delayed as the death anniversary fell within the fifty-day period.

10th day, Hinoto-ushi: Wind and rain, clearing at the hour of the Horse. I visited Ōtsu Yasutoshi to offer greetings regarding the unfortunate matter, and presented gifts for father's 100th day memorial including one bag of shiitake mushrooms and a box of lidded tea bowls as mementos, as well as one bag of purple bracken for Shūshi's 100th day memorial. I returned home at evening.

11th day, Tsuchinoe-tora: Clear. Kōjōan-in-den's funeral procession to Shōkokuji temple took place at the hour of the Cock.

13th day, Kanoe-tatsu: Clear. The 12th meeting of the Kagura lecture was held as usual at Okudaya in Sanbon-ki. I did not attend as I was on leave from family residence duties.

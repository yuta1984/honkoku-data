When Kinan came and examined [Shūshi], from this afternoon she suffered severe anguish, grinding her teeth and showing signs of internal attack. We urgently requested examinations by Kyōi, Chokushin and others, but as it appeared to be a difficult case to treat, we tried various rare medicines, but ultimately her recovery was not achieved, and she died at the half-quarter of the Hour of the Dog. She was four years old at this time. How extremely pitiful and lamentable. Accordingly, Kyōdō, Kyōi and others were summoned, and the household servants, both men and women, came in one after another. Formal mourning attire notification was submitted: no mourning [■], Tsunechika temporary two-day wear, Tsunenori, Tsunehiro and others temporary three-day wear. As stated above, this was reported through Kyōdō to the meeting place Kikatae.

11th Day, Tsuchinoto-U, Clear - Early morning, reported to the lord's household that a four-year-old girl died last night, therefore no mourning [■], temporary two-day wear. Specifically addressed to both Samon and Taitō. Next, reported the death to physician Sai Kinan. Next, sent the same notification to Horikawa Ōmi-no-kami for his information. ○ After consultation regarding the late Shūshi's burial site, it was decided upon the southern area of the late father's grave and Kyōagata-nushi's cemetery in Nakano-kawara. Then the ground ceremony was requested from and performed by Kisei. Ritual implements were sent as usual. ○ At the same time, mother and Tsunechika's grave visit was as yesterday. ○ This evening was Shūshi's funeral. Accordingly, for funeral implements, we borrowed one long sword, one set of large and small [swords], one box lantern, etc., from the third group of the village compact association. Today notification was submitted to the palace, messenger Ishimatsu was sent to inform, and buying messenger Soshirō was sent for necessary items. From around the Hour of the Monkey, sake, soup, rice, etc., were served to the upper and lower [servants] as usual. At evening, the body was placed in the coffin and each person offered incense. Although it was during the summer earth season, today was said to be an "interval day." Nevertheless, as it was a U day, around the Hour of the Dog, calling it the Hour of the Rat, the coffin was carried out for burial. The procession was as follows: 《Note: However, prior to this, notification was sent to Kyūshin-an as on previous occasions》

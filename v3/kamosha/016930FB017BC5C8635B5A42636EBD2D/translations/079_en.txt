27th day, Kanoe-Uma, clear - Around the Hour of the Sheep, Kyūemon (over 60 years old), a village elder and farmer from Okazaki village, threw himself into the well in the garden of the shogun's residence. Immediately servants rushed over and pulled him up. He had fainted but soon regained consciousness. On the same day, his son and relatives were summoned and entrusted with his care. From then on, both Kyūemon and his son were prohibited from making official visits, and strict day-and-night surveillance was ordered. This was completely due to mental derangement and senility - an unprecedented incident.

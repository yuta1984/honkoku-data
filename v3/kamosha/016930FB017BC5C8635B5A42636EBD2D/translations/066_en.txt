Akiaki, Suefusa, Michiyasu, Suehatsu, Kiyonori, Atsuhira and other twelve members submitted a written inquiry to the Left Santé. However, regarding Akataka, the truth was that he had gone down to the Kantō region this spring as an attendant to Lord Takakura.

　　Oral inquiry submitted

Signatories《Hokai and others》
To the Santé

Regarding this matter, it was deemed appropriate for all senior and junior members of the Santé to convene together, so on the 16th day there was a mixed assembly. The evaluation council wished to inquire of Akataka himself, so they summoned him through the ceremonial official, but he was away, so his adoptive father Shimousa-no-kami Hirosune appeared as his representative. When shown the inquiry document, he immediately replied: "At this time, due to urgent matters, he has gone down to the Kantō region from Lord Takakura's residence, so we humbly request your merciful consideration," and then withdrew. Therefore, it was roughly decided in the evaluation that those who return after an extended absence should either take the lowest seat, or serve after completing ascetic practices, or be assigned to the rice field rotation. Furthermore, it was decided that all senior and junior members from Shingū and below should convene together, so on the 22nd day there was an assembly of Shingū and others. Although adoptive father Hirosune submitted a petition, it was deemed inadmissible, and it was decided he should serve after completing ascetic practices. Regarding this matter, Hirosune and one or two of the next-ranked members who had been inquired about were summoned《Suefusa, Suehide》, attended, and were informed of the decision.

29th day, Kinoe-Tatsu, clear weather - Magistrate Mizuno Echizen-no-kami entered the house for the first time today. At this time, the Great Retired Shōgun was slightly indisposed, so there was an audience with the Young Shōgun. When the Great Retired Shōgun was in good health, there would be the customary exchange of sake cups, but today only congratulatory words were offered.

Last day, Kinoto-Mi, clear weather - For the third memorial service of the late Keoka-agatanushi, I visited Yasutoshi in Ōtsu combining it with a seasonal courtesy call. As in previous years, I brought pickled vegetables in jars and returned with Michie. I arrived home at the latter part of the Hour of the Monkey.

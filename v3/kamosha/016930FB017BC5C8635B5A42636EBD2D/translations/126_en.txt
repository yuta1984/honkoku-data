11th day, Mizunoto-Tori (Water Rooster): Clear. Boarded the noon boat after the Snake hour (past 10 AM). Light rain and thunder in the afternoon, arrived at Yodo in the evening and lodged there. For the periodic prayer duty rotation, Hitsugen-shu served as deputy.

12th day, Kinoe-Inu (Wood Dog): Cloudy. Returned to the palace around the Snake hour (10 AM), reported arrival, inquired about his lordship's health, then returned home.

15th day, Hinoto-Ushi (Fire Ox): Clear. Visited Seo Jibei's house. His son Genkurō (age 23) has long had bad conduct and dissolute habits. Despite repeated admonishments, he recently left home again without returning, making the matter of family succession problematic. This time he submitted a written pledge to his father Jibei, shaved his head, and requested that his father and relatives handle the succession matter appropriately. He changed his name to Terai Jōun with the designation Maruya Bettaku. While it was agreed that Jibei would provide his annual living expenses, passage to and from the main house was strictly forbidden to everyone from the main family, relatives, clerks, to servants. This was conveyed to me today by Jibei. This matter had been privately discussed when Seo Yahei, myself and others were invited some days ago, and was thus settled as described.

16th day, Tsuchinoe-Tora (Earth Tiger): Clear. At the palace, received ceremonial sake cup for the Kashō celebration as usual each year.

18th day, Kanoe-Tatsu (Metal Dragon): Clear. In recent years, visited the grave site of the late Kyūma at Sanpō-ji temple. This was delayed due to being in Osaka during the mourning period.

22nd day, Kinoe-Saru (Wood Monkey): Clear. After lunch, the senior and junior members of the three groups under Shingū assembled, and I attended for the Kyōsen fifth group's duty rotation. According to the announcement by职中's Ki, regarding the matter from last winter's settlement where Yūki's days were difficult to establish and correspondence was submitted, the question of how future议定 should be handled was assigned to the 职中 at the previous meeting, so it was announced today. According to the discussion, when such matters occur in the future and there are those who finally submit correspondence after paying for one or two years, since this would result in actual replacements among the servants, it would be appropriate to establish that those who collected for one or two years and then submitted claims should be suspended for three years. However, today's decision was also questionable, and it would be better to make a rough determination after another meeting and consult in conference. After this concluded, the groups under Shingū and others dispersed. Next, the 职中 announced to the senior and junior members that according to notes, due to financial difficulties at the kitchen office, trees in Takigaya mountain would be cut.

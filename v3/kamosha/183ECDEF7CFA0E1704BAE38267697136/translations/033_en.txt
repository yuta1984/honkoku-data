The ceremonial guards, imperial stable attendants, and imperial cattle herders
followed the usual customs. Female messengers, court ladies,
and kurōdo (chamberlains) were also recorded. When the Saiin (Imperial Princess serving at Kamo Shrine)
was present, the purification ritual officials crossed Ichijō Avenue,
the court ladies visited the shrine pavilion, and there were
return festivities at Murasaki Plain and other events, so the festival
ceremonies were quite magnificent. However, after the Genkyū era,
these traditions have long been discontinued.
【Up to here is the continuation from the previous frame】
In years when there were no messengers from the various imperial palaces, it seemed
lonely, but this was to manifest the divine power of the Great Bright Deity
and to further encourage the heart of reverence for the gods.
Those who witness this must never treat it with disrespect.

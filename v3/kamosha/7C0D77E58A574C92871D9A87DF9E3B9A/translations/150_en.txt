Inner shrine section: 1 below Ketsugami, 1 below the two shrines, 1 around Tama Bridge, 1 at the entrance to the fish vendor's shop, and 2 on the left and right of the torii gate. Total: 7 lanterns on bamboo poles.

Two stable buildings for the bureau were set up by the shrine community on the east side south of Shirahige Shrine within the two torii gates of the front shrine.

The tall lanterns erected by the city magistrate numbered 8 at the front shrine, located as follows:

2 on the left and right below the stone wall in front of the sanctuary, 1 at the south corner inside the gate, 2 under the eaves below the Mikoya, 2 in front of the guard station, and 1 at the northeast corner of Fudo Hall. Total: 8 lanterns.

Inner shrine section:
2 in front of the inner guard station, 1 to the northwest of the vigil quarters, 1 at the northwest corner of Jizo Hall, and 2 on the left and right inside the gate. Total: 6 lanterns.

Regarding the customary locations where the city magistrate erects lanterns, today the guard unit sent 6 wooden lantern stands as tokens of gratitude, which were brought up from Kamo and presented. For the 2 lanterns below the stone platform of the front shrine, since the shrine community was asked to ensure they would not fall over, they were erected on bamboo poles bearing the double hollyhock crest.

At Kifune, until the shrine relocation was completed, fire patrols were conducted at Kamo as well, with 5 laborers from Hiiragi-hara making rounds throughout the night wearing haori jackets and camp helmets. At Kifune, 5 laborers from Kamo conducted similar patrols.

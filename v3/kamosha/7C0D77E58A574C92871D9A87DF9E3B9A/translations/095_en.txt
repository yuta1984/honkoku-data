1. Around the hour of申上刻, officials from the Palace Maintenance Bureau (wearing court dress with fifth-rank robes) and subordinates (in hunting dress) attended and laid out cloth mats
with borders. Most importantly, before this, head supervisor Yonekiyo Kaneto (wearing hunting dress) attended and
had mat pathways laid from the temporary shrine to the main shrine (about ten of these reed mats). Six tan of cloth mats were
handed over from the shrine to the Palace Maintenance Bureau, who laid them out. Iron weights,
two pieces, were also used. However, the cloth mats were laid in double width, and the bordered seating mats
brought by the Palace Maintenance Bureau were laid on top of the mat pathway.
After the divine relocation was completed and the courtyard torches were extinguished, removal proceeded as before. However, at this time the temporary shrine doors were
closed while the main shrine doors remained open, so to prevent the Palace Maintenance Bureau from ascending from the steps to the main floor,
head supervisor Yonekiyo Kaneto quickly removed them.

torii, crossed the stone bridge, entered the second torii, crossed the Negi bridge and Tama bridge (head priest and ritualist
together), entered through the tower gate's middle gate, and entered the shrine grounds through the side door. This was still planned, but as it was raining at this time, each took red umbrellas from the retreat quarters
(from inside the second torii, court dress attendants carried them. Though this procedure had no
precedent, it was done thus after unanimous consultation). Those attending
as follows (the procession arrangement was overseen only by head supervisors Usuke and Yasuakimi). First twenty-one divine attendants proceeded, followed by one sword bearer carrying [implements].

Petition Statement
The golden lanterns donated by the Imperial Palace are placed as a pair in front of the main shrine, and with this reconstruction, repairs and new construction of shrine-attached lantern stands have been ordered. However, we feel it would be presumptuous to leave the donated lanterns as they are. Since this concerns the Kyōhō era, during the Kanpō reconstruction there was little time elapsed and no damage, so we left them as献じ置き and did not submit a petition. In this case, many years have passed and the situation is as described above, so if repairs could be ordered, the entire shrine community would be most grateful. We respectfully petition for this matter. The above.

1. The representatives who appeared after the hour of the Dog returned home and explained: They visited Magistrate Hinnonishi Ben-dono and submitted in writing the matter of Kibune temporary relocation dates, which was acknowledged. Then they visited Imperial Messenger Kushige Dainagon-dono, reported what had been submitted to the magistrate, and petitioned in writing for repairs of the donated golden lanterns. However, since he was going to court and would feel bad if there were any mistakes, the intermediaries suggested bringing it to the Imperial Palace to make the report there as well. So they went to the Hi-kurōdo entrance and reported what had been submitted to the magistrate regarding the temporary relocation dates. They also brought a written petition concerning the lanterns, and when they inquired whether to submit it through intermediaries or receive a direct audience, they were told there would be a response later. They then petitioned in writing for repairs to the lanterns, and noted that when the donation was made, it was handed from the Imperial Messenger to the shrine representatives. However, since this differed from what had been privately mentioned earlier, they mentioned this point. When asked who the Imperial Messenger was and for specific dates, they replied that it was the 25th day of the 12th month of Kyōhō 1st year, with Imperial Messenger Hino Dainagon-dono and Magistrate Karasumaru-dono.

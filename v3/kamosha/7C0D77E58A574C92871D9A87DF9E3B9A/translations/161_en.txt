13th day 《Kinoto-i》 Clear, with evening shower in the evening

1. Since yesterday's meeting was postponed, it was held today. Contents disclosed by Ujitetsu at the meeting place:
   1. Regarding the letter that arrived on the 8th from Yamashina Tajima-no-kami of the Imperial Treasury to Echizen-no-kami and Mimasaka-no-kami:
      The content was about gifts given by one shrine on the night of the formal relocation at Kifune, which differed from precedent. In response to this inquiry, we replied that we would investigate and send a return letter after further consultation.
      In the deliberation, it was decided to send a letter stating that there is no precedent, as we had already informed the magistrate.

   1. Regarding the request made on the 11th by deputy Kaneken: Since the shrine relocation and other duties were performed without incident, when new pure vestments are made, he would like to receive some from the horse racing allocation. Of course, if new hakama are also made, he would like to receive the old ones. He has heard rumors that in previous years, the deputy of that time received old items. However, this request is not based on precedent, but he would like to receive them.
      Shoshi Yasuhiro made a similar request.
      In deliberation: Since items were distributed during Kanpō era, and this time involved particular hardship, regardless of condition, it would be appropriate to give the old pure vestments. As for hakama, since only one was newly made and the others were repaired, they are difficult to give. Since the head priest also worked hard, it was decided to give only the old robes from horse racing, regardless of condition.

   1. Regarding the attire that the Bettō-dayū, Azukari-dayū, poetry officials and others requested previously, they made the request again yesterday.
      In deliberation: If this is a customary matter, there are similar precedents elsewhere, but considering the exceptional hardship and their request, it was decided to give them respectively.

   1. Since all construction work was completed without incident, according to precedent for congratulatory gifts to the police magistrate: during Kanpō it was ten ryō in gold, but since miscellaneous expenses have been reduced this time, it was decided that ten pieces of silver would be appropriate.

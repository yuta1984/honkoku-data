from the base, the sacred worship pillars are moved inward, reaching the base of the west sliding boards of the temporary hall. The double outer curtains are drawn around from the eastern prayer hall's Chinese-style doors through the interior of the fence's double gate transom area, enclosing Sugi-no-o Shrine within and hanging with clear sight lines to the southwest corner base of the sacred offering hall. Additionally, they are hung from the base of the temporary hall's west sliding boards westward to the sacred offering hall. Furthermore, it is noted afterward that if there are outer curtains, the upper ones would be unnecessary.

1. When the three sacred tables' ritual offerings are completed, the General Administrator provides guidance to the Horse Bureau, and after this matter is reported to the controller's curtained area, there is withdrawal from the curtained area. At this time, following recent precedent, with the rank of ritual offering messenger, two General Administrators and ten shrine attendants precede the imperial messenger, carrying torches from the tower gate to the first torii to see off [the imperial messenger].
1. After the main shrine's doors are closed, the imperial messenger, controller, and assistant official are promptly reported to by the representatives at their rest area. After approximately half an hour, the imperial messenger and others return to the capital via the Misono entrance, taking the same route as initially.
1. After the half-hour of the ox period passed, it was reported to the meeting hall that the hospitality matters were completed without delay, and everyone withdrew.

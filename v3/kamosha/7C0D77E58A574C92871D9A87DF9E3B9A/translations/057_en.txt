　　　Same month, 25th, hour of the rooster　Same, Kataoka Shrine formal reconstruction
　　　September 2nd, hour of the rooster　　Same, Kifune Shrine formal reconstruction
　　We humbly request that officials be dispatched for the above three formal reconstructions. The imperial palace officials should be stationed to the left and right between the tower gate and middle gate, as well as outside the Chinese gate during the Main Shrine event. During the Kataoka Shrine event, they should be stationed in the earthen building. Regarding the magistrate's office officials, for both shrines they should patrol around the shrine grounds and below. The attendants should serve as advance guards for the imperial messenger and others. For Kifune, at the far end, the shrine community will set up quarters for the imperial palace officials for both shrines. They will be stationed in these quarters. There will be no patrols from the magistrate's office. Regarding the attendants for the Main Shrine and Kataoka Shrine,

　　similarly they should serve as advance guards for the imperial messenger and others. This follows the precedent of the Shōtoku and Kanpō eras, so we humbly request that officials be dispatched as in previous times for this occasion as well. The above.

1. The negi priests of the six shrines from Shingū onward successfully received the imperial edict through the court liaison without incident. Of course, they went to pay respects and report to the magistrate, and after returning home past the hour of the horse, each immediately went to serve at their respective shrines and prepared for divine inspection (wearing court dress).

1. After the first half of the snake hour, I went together with Shigeue Kanemochi to visit Major Counselor Kushige, the court liaison. During this time, those who had received imperial permission for court ranks also accompanied us, and soon we had an audience and successfully received the written imperial decree without incident. Of course, among those who hold court ranks together, Shōkyū, due to his higher rank, will receive the written decree from the officials first.

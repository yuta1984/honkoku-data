Sacred sake and other offerings were prepared and presented according to the prescribed order.

After the ceremonies at the front shrine concluded, past the hour of the Boar, the procession to the inner shrine began. Before the controller's arrival at the inner shrine, an announcement was made to the rest quarters of the various officials who were to proceed to the inner shrine: "The procession will now commence." Therefore, each official proceeded to the inner shrine ahead of time and awaited the controller's arrival.

The guard officials of the imperial palace group took their positions at the guard station, and like at the front shrine, thin mats were spread on the courtyard ground under the eaves of the small veranda of the construction supervisors' vigil quarters, with lanterns placed in front where they sat.

Those participating in voluntary worship sat on long benches spread outside the outer curtains in the courtyard - at the front shrine, this was above the temporary Fudō hall, east of the main hall, or near Ushiichi Shrine; at the inner shrine, long benches were spread in front of Suzuichi Shrine where they sat facing east.

The court musicians proceeded after the controller's arrival and remained kneeling in convenient locations in the courtyard until the controller's departure.

For the inner shrine, after the controller's procession, he proceeded at will on foot in court dress and cap, and mats were spread under the four eaves of the worship hall where he sat discretely during the sacred relocation as arranged by the head administrator. He withdrew to the rest quarters before the controller's worship after the sacred relocation was completed. This was his private devotional visit out of reverence.

The ceremonies at the inner shrine concluded without incident past the first half of the hour of the Ox. The imperial messenger, controller, and other officials descended the mountain and returned to the capital. From around this time, rain finally began to fall. Since the rain came after all ceremonies were completed, everyone was particularly delighted by this.

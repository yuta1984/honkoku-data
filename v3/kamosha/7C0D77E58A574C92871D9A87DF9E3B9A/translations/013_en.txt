Regarding the matter that the Kanpō specifications record states "togi repair," but this time it would be appropriate to submit a request for exemption.

In the deliberation, since there was someone who stated that they believed the aforementioned matter had been reported to the Eastern Office previously, it was deemed appropriate to examine the daily records from that time. Upon examination, it was found that on August 16, Anei 4 (1775), a notification document had been submitted to the Eastern Office regarding the complete renewal of the inner shrine sword. Therefore, it was decided that it would be appropriate to submit a notification as a precaution during today's inspection of the Kibune shrine treasures and request that the complete renewal be ordered.

The ceremony followed the annual custom, with the chief priest obtaining the imperial will from the shrine officials at the administrative building seat. The content was as follows:
　Tomorrow, after the divine offerings for the Choyo festival are removed, the replacement sacred vestments should be enshrined in the new hall, and since there is currently retreat at the samurai quarters, tomorrow earth-colored garments would be appropriate. Everyone acknowledged this. At this time, the officials of both Shingu shrines and Ota celebrants were not present, so they should receive these instructions tomorrow.

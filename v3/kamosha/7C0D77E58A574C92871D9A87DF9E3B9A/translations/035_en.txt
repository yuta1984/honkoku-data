[continuation from previous page] if [work] does not begin, it would be quite impossible to complete within August. However, since this is not a fixed matter, and everything has come to be discussed from bottom to top, it would be inappropriate for Shimogamo to go first. When this was conveyed, Kichibei replied, "If such is the case, would it be acceptable if the main shrine and Kataoka Shrine are completed within August?" Later, when Hoshō made the same inquiry again, the response was the same.

1. Regarding the repair of bows for Kataoka Shrine and the eight other shrines, [the work] was entrusted to Motoyasu and [the bows] were handed over to him.

We understand that for the decorative sword within the main shrine's temporary hall, there is an official donation from the government, but regarding the other sword, it is to be provided by the shrine community. We would like to make a donation for this. If the shrine has no particular preference, regarding the arrangements, as Maeda Chūjirō conveyed to Hoshō, what would be appropriate? If [the shrine] has no particular preference, shall this matter be discussed at tomorrow's (12th) extraordinary meeting?'"

Therefore, [we request] that there be such a donation from the construction supervisors. Tomorrow at the meeting, Hoshō will make an announcement, and after everyone understands, arrangements should be made."

Next, the head carpenter (seidaiku) performs three bows. At this time, the voice-caller (koekake) calls out "Eiei-mune" (eternal prosperity of the ridgepole), and the head master carpenter strikes the hammer as before. When this is completed, the elder (chō) takes up the ritual offerings (hei), stands, hangs them on the west pillar base, and withdraws. At this time, the head carpenter also withdraws. The court musicians stop playing music.

Next, the head master carpenter, attendants (zuishin), voice-callers, and others descend from the roof, bow once in the center of the courtyard, and return to their seats.

Next, the head metalsmith (sei-kaji), head carpenter, and others advance to the courtyard, bow once, proceed directly before the shrine officials and construction supervisors, perform one bow, and withdraw.

Next, the shrine officials and construction supervisors each withdraw and make pilgrimages to the subsidiary and small shrines.

Next, the shrine officials take their seats in the gosho-ya (main hall). {{The head priest (kannushi) ascends the west stairs and sits in the north seat (facing south from the center), the senior priest (negi) ascends the west stairs and sits in the west seat (facing east, arranged north to south), the ritualist (hafuri) ascends the east stairs and sits in the east seat (facing west, arranged north to south). The deputy administrator and his assistants sit in the next seats.}}

Next, the construction supervisor sits in the kiri-shiba seat northwest of the gosho-ya. {{One tatami mat is also laid out, with reward certificates placed in an inkstone lid, and a plain jacket is held by an attendant in the rear.}} The head and deputy head carpenters, master carpenter leaders, metalsmiths, and others line up on the kiri-shiba southwest of the gosho-ya.

At the construction supervisor's signal, the head carpenter {{removes his undergarment at the kiri-shiba terrace}} and approaches before the construction supervisor's seat. The construction supervisor presents the rewards. {{Opening a fan to receive them, he bows with the gifts held above his head, withdraws to the south courtyard of the gosho-ya, bows once toward the shrine officials' seats, and sits on the long platform on the south courtyard grass.}} The ceremony for the other metalsmiths and others receiving rewards follows the same procedure as for the head carpenter. During this time, the evening divine meal is offered at the outer sanctuary, with court musicians playing music.

Next, the construction supervisor rises from his seat and takes his place in the gosho-ya seat.

Next, the shrine officials and others hold ceremonies of direct mutual offering of sacred food and sake cup exchange in the gosho-ya seats. For the carpenters and metalsmiths, they sit on the long platform on the south courtyard grass, perform the direct mutual offering of sacred food, and then each disperses.

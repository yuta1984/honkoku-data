The ceremonial robes for rotation were stored after the divine offerings were removed. The manner of storage was in all respects the same as in the fourth month ceremony. While these rotation ceremonial robes should have been newly made, following the precedent of the Kanpō era, suitable items from those previously removed were first examined and selected for storage after careful consideration. This was naturally done after consultation with all concerned.

Since Sawada Ujigami Shrine and others are still enshrined in temporary halls, there was no opening of the sacred doors, and the divine offerings for both inner and outer shrines were presented at the large platform. The other subsidiary shrines followed the usual procedures.

1. Wakamiya negi Motoyasu and Nara negi Kenken, having completed the shrine relocation without incident the previous night, appeared before the imperial messenger and magistrate after the morning meal. No written report was required, and they returned home around the hour of the Sheep. The attendants were provided by the shrine community.

1. Tonight during the hours of the Dog and Boar, for the formal relocation of the shrines of Ryūboku, Fukutoku, Shirahige, Chinju, Hyakudayū and others, head magistrates Morimori, Yasumasa, and Suke-toshi appeared, and curtains and other equipment were set up. During the day, the head priest performed the interior decoration.

《This matter was omitted from the shrine records》

1. For the above formal relocations, daily offerings were presented to the main shrine's subsidiary shrines and the five small shrines as usual.

1. The above shrines began at the half-hour of the Rooster and concluded after the hour of the Rat. Divine offerings, sacred sake, and a feast were held at the Ōta worship hall. The order of shrine relocations was: first Ryūboku, then Fukutoku, then Shirahige, then Chinju, then Hyakudayū. The relocation procedures were the same as for other shrines, so details are omitted.

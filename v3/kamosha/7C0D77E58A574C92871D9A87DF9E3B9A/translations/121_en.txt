1. The ritual offerings (four gō) presented to the main shrine were stored in the imperial repository.
1. Regarding the imperial proclamations (senmyō) and imperial edicts (senji) submitted by Chief Priest Hirohisa and Assistant Priest Kataka no Isaku:
   The record is as follows:

By imperial decree, we reverently address the august Kamo Imperial Deity: As the shrine had gradually fallen into disrepair, we have undertaken new repairs and reconstruction, rebuilt the main hall in magnificent splendor, and now celebrate the ritual relocation. That this may be accomplished without difficulty from wind and rain, safely and without incident, according to the imperial will, we believe depends upon the deep benevolence and broad assistance of the Imperial Deity. Therefore, selecting and determining an auspicious day and favorable time, we dispatch Senior Second Rank Acting Major Counselor Fujiwara no Ason Takamochi, Junior Assistant in the Imperial Prosecuting Office Junior Fifth Rank Lower Source no Ason Koreyoshi,

and others, having them bear the great ritual offerings in place of the ceremony and present them. August Deity, hear this petition peacefully and tranquilly, protect the Emperor's court so that the throne remains unmoved, firm as eternal rock, guarding night and day, bringing prosperity, keeping all under heaven in great peace and the four seas in tranquil calm, protecting and caring for all—this we reverently petition.

Aneei 6th year, 8th month, 19th day
Senior Second Rank Acting Major Counselor Fujiwara no Ason Takamochi
Proclaiming the imperial edict: Regarding the ritual offerings to Kamo Wakeikazuchi Shrine

The hafuri priests should be seated in the connecting hall. Additionally, since there has been no purification since today's handover from the construction office, it was requested that someone from the cleaning group should be stationed at the shrine grounds and summoned. When Sutejū-dayū Yasuaki took charge and came to the vigil building, it was immediately requested that purification be carried out promptly, which was acknowledged. Accordingly, one shrine attendant was summoned to perform the duties. Thus it proceeded as usual.

1. From the announcement at the ceremonial day meeting hall by Mori Akira:
　1. Record of petition submitted by Kanō Kuranosuke
　　　　Petition respectfully submitted
　　1. We are deeply honored that the construction has been completed and the formal shrine relocation has been accomplished. However,
　　　regarding the remaining silver for painting fees and additional labor costs, we request that full payment be made on the last day of this month.
　　　Especially since my disciples have repeatedly requested to receive their labor fees,
　　　I respectfully petition on their behalf. If we could receive full payment on the last day of the month, both myself and my disciples would be
　　　most grateful and joyful. I earnestly petition for your favorable consideration of this matter. With respect.

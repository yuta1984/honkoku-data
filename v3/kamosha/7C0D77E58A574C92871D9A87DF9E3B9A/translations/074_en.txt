13th Day
1. After the morning meal, Kanemochi alone went as a representative to the Imperial messenger magistrate, Eastern and Western administrative offices, Sumikura, etc. He returned home around the hour of the Rooster and reported as follows: When he appeared at the Western administrative office and applied to the official in charge, Murayama Tomiemon came out. He submitted a petition for restricting cattle and horses on the imperial route during the Kibune formal shrine relocation, along with one document detailing the imperial visit route. He also stated that he was prepared to be ordered not to submit petitions during the main shrine ceremony. He also submitted one document with the date and time for the Kamo Kibune subsidiary shrine formal relocation, one document allocating rest stops and lodging for the imperial messenger and others, one document with the timing of the imperial messenger's visit, etc. Later, Maeda Tadajiro came out and said that the petition for restricting cattle and horses had been accepted and would be granted according to precedent. Therefore, when asked whether it would naturally be granted according to precedent for the main shrine ceremony as well, he replied that there would be no cattle and horse restrictions, as there would be advance clearing, and moreover purification from defilement would be ordered, so that would not be necessary - meaning it would be like today's Shimogamo. The other documents were received by Murayama. Of course, the names of the imperial messenger and others should be reported as soon as they are known.

Then he went east and applied to the inspector's office, where Kimura Genhachiro came out. When the petition for cattle and horse restrictions during the Kibune formal relocation was submitted to the west, it was accepted, so when he submitted the relevant document, it was received. Next, he went to Sumikura Naijiro and reported that due to this formal relocation, since an imperial messenger would visit, bridges would be built and also extended to the earthworks. Next, he visited the imperial messenger and reported that the repair of the donated lantern that had been previously petitioned for was completed, and since the craftsman had brought it, he had received it and first offered thanks and notification. He also stated that if there were an official handover ceremony, he would offer thanks again later. He made the same statement to the magistrate.

1. After the hour of the rooster, representative Kiei returned home and reported as follows: After the hour of the monkey, he went to the west office, but since the official in charge had retired, he was told to visit either Irie or Maeda. This was communicated at the accounting office, so he went to visit Irie-shi for a meeting, where he was told the following: How does the shrine community consider the matter of security for the formal relocation ceremonies of Kataoka Shrine and Kifune Shrine? When asked this, he replied that within the shrine community, discussions were still undecided about whether to inquire at the government office within the next day or two, or whether there might be official orders. Irie responded that this would likely be the case, and therefore both Kamo shrines were summoned. The purpose was that even if security matters were submitted to the government office, it would only take up time with various discussions, so after deliberating at the government office, they would like to submit to Kushige-dono a request that officials be dispatched from both offices as was done on the 19th. If submitted promptly, they could visit the offices together even tomorrow morning, and thereafter arrangements would be made at the government office. However, since this is a private matter, it must not be mentioned outside. But it would not matter if there were private rumors among Kushige-dono and the officials. In this sequence, the notification document regarding provisions for the visit was handed over to Irie-shi.

1. When he went to the residence of Kimura Genhachiro of the Eastern Inspector's office and submitted the notification document for provisions for the visit, he was told: The Kamo matter is extremely difficult, so it's hard to accept. If we accompany you to the government office from here, it will take until around the first half of the night. Therefore, he said he would bring it to the government office tomorrow morning and took it back.

1. That same night, Naruhisa alone, as representative, brought a security petition to the Imperial Messenger and Administrator. The record: Respectfully submitted
　　For the formal relocation of Kataoka Shrine on the coming 25th day and the formal relocation of Kifune Shrine on the 2nd day of the 9th month,
　　according to precedent, security was provided by the City Magistrate, but due to current vacancies,
　　we would like to request that officials from both government offices be dispatched as was done on the 19th day.
　　We respectfully request that you issue favorable instructions on this matter so that the formal relocations may be carried out without incident.
　　We submit this matter. Above

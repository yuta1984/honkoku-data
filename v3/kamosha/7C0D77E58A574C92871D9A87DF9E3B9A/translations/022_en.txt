1. When the ridge-raising ceremony is completed and the head priest and others withdraw from before the altar, the head carpenter takes the voice rope that is tied to the northeast pillar of the middle gate in front of the Chinese-style doors and presents it to the head priest. After the head priest completes his silent prayer, he passes it to the senior priest. The senior priest completes his silent prayer and passes it to the head ritualist. From there it continues in order to the deputy senior priest and so forth, reaching the clan deity ritualist, who completes his silent prayer and returns it to the head carpenter. Next, the group of ten elders also complete their silent prayers in the same manner as the shrine officials. This ceremony follows the same format as in the Kanpō era.

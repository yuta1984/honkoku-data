1. Regarding the two court musicians: According to precedent, they were given one set each of pure vestments and hakama, but this time there are no surplus funds, so what should be done?
   In deliberation: Since this was done according to precedent, it was decided that they should be given these items even if they need to be specially prepared.

1. The Shinto priest Ikyū of Kifune submitted imperial edicts and imperial orders.
   The paper used was toriko and yellow paper.

   By Imperial decree, we humbly and fearfully address the great deity of Kifune before your sacred presence.
   Revering shrines is the eternal custom from ancient times to the present. Having replaced the old with new construction and management, completing the project and beautifully decorating the main hall, the shrine relocation is now being conducted. That it was accomplished safely without incident, despite wind and rain difficulties, and with divine response, is thought to be due to the great deity's benevolence and assistance. Therefore, selecting an auspicious day and favorable time,
   we dispatch Senior Second Rank Acting Provisional Major Counselor Fujiwara no Ason Takamochi to present the great offerings of gratitude.
   Great deity, please receive this petition peacefully and tranquilly, and protect and bless the Imperial Court so that the imperial throne remains unmoved, as firm as eternal rock, guarding it night and day. We humbly and fearfully make this request.

   Anei 6, 9th month, 2nd day
   Senior Second Rank Acting Provisional Major Counselor Fujiwara no Ason Takamochi

   Proclaiming the imperial edict: Due to the offering ceremony at Kifune Shrine
   Official duties should be suspended for one day as appropriate. Respectfully submitted.
   Those responsible for clearing the way.

The structures were to be dismantled the following day. The temporary roofing within the shrine precincts had been removed earlier.

After the ritual of closing the sacred doors (go-tobira) of the inner shrine was completed, the head administrator (sōbugyō) reported to the imperial messenger (densō) and administrator at their rest quarters, after which they returned to the capital.

Today's attendees, both high and low ranking, numbered about 150 people. Soup, sesame, dried foods, pickled vegetables, and sake were prepared, with eggs added after nightfall. However, the higher-ranking participants had dried sweetfish and boiled eggplant instead of dried foods for their evening meal. Meals for all participants, including those keeping vigil, were prepared at the inner kitchen quarters, and food was transported from there to the assembled officials.

Regarding the seating arrangements for the imperial messenger and other officials during worship, while instructions had previously been given for them to be positioned in the courtyard, it was changed so that they would be in the worship hall instead. This revision was communicated from the controller (ben-dono) to Yasunori at the duty station.

The sacred relocation ceremony (sen-gyo) was completed around the first half of the hour of the Dog (around 8:00 PM), followed by the presentation of sacred treasures, offering of sacred food, and closing of the sacred doors, finishing around past the hour of the Boar (around 10:00 PM). Regarding the door-closing ceremony, a representative made the formal report to the imperial messenger and administrator at their rest quarters.

After the head priest's presentation of sacred offerings, the imperial messenger proceeded from the rest quarters. First, he removed his sword at the base of the stone platform, then received the imperial edict from the minor secretary, proceeded to the worship hall, and read the imperial edict from his seat there. After completing the edict ceremony, he made his sacred offering, with Hamashima Shima-no-kami (wearing fifth-rank court dress) serving as assistant. After completing the sacred offering ceremony, he withdrew from before the deity and entered the rest quarters. After donning his sword at the base of the stone platform, the controller rose from his curtained seat and proceeded to the worship hall seat for his sacred offering. Assistant Hayamizu Kazusa-no-suke (wearing hunting dress, unlined robe, and sword) served in this role. After the controller's sacred offering ceremony was completed, he returned to his curtained seat. Next, officials from the Left and Right Imperial Stables led the sacred horses to the base of the stone platform in the courtyard. This ceremony took place within the two torii gates - the horses had been led up from the stable quarters to the stone platform earlier and were waiting east of the shrine attendants' quarters. At the appropriate time, they proceeded to the base of the stone platform. Both Left and Right Stable officials simultaneously bowed once toward the sacred presence, then led the horses down to the rear gate and withdrew. Next, the controller withdrew from his curtained area and entered the rest quarters. At this time, attendants cleared the way ahead, and court musicians, wearing court dress and caps, took their positions before the sacred presence.

Among the various administrators

1. After the hour of the Sheep (around 2-3 PM), upon returning and explaining the situation: when the petition papers were submitted to the magistrate, they were received, and we were asked to wait briefly. Later, we had an audience. The imperial edict messenger will visit on the last day of the month after the hour of the Sheep. Regarding the imperial edict for the six shrines, we are to appear before the court liaison on the 4th of next month at the hour of the Snake. We were also instructed to submit the procedural documents and diagrams for the Kataoka Shrine relocation sometime next month.

29th day
1. After breakfast, as general representatives, Shigeuye and Kanemochi went to the Eastern and Western government offices. The copy of the documents they brought is as follows:

Respectfully submitted petition
8th month, 19th day, hour of the Cock: Main shrine of Kami-Kamo formal relocation
Same month, 25th day, hour of the Cock: Kataoka Shrine formal relocation

For both of these formal relocations, we respectfully request that government officials attend. Regarding the palace officials: they should be stationed on the left and right between the tower gate and middle gate, and above the outside of the Chinese-style gate. Regarding the magistrate's office officials: they should patrol around the shrine grounds. Regarding the attendants: they should stand before the imperial messenger and others. This follows the precedent established during the Shotoku and Kanpo eras, so we respectfully request that officials attend this time as well, following previous practice. The above.

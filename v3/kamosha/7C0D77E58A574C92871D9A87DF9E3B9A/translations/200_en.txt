　One: On the 8th, at Horiuchi Shrine, on grounds of three and a half tsubo, there is a tutelary shrine, but what shrine it is
　　was unclear, so at the previous meeting when Fusun was asked, since it was from around the Genroku era, the shrine records were
　　consulted and found it was around the 9th month of the 3rd year, but the shrine name was completely unknown, therefore
　　the elders and senior members of Takegahana were to be summoned for inquiry, so Takeno Hyōe was summoned and
　　instructed accordingly
　One: Takeno Hyōe appeared and reported that when he inquired among the town elders about the name of the small shrine as instructed,
　　they did not know. The sacred lamps have recently been offered by neighbors on the 1st day of the 11th month
　　Council decision: Since the shrine name is clearly unknown, it was unanimously decided that it should have a relocation ceremony as a tutelary shrine
　One: The head priest requested whether regarding the relocation of Fujiki Two Shrines, Komori Shrine, and Takegahana Tutelary Shrine,
　　a divination document should be submitted within the coming 18th and 9th days
　　By council decision, it is appropriate to request that a divination document be submitted to the yin-yang diviners; regarding the offering of sacred provisions,
　　the shrine records should be consulted, to be entrusted to the monthly duty officers

- Before the appointed time, daily offerings (nikku) are prepared and presented to the Main Shrine, Temporary Shrine, Secondary Shrines, and Small Shrines. The duty priest Sawada Hafuri Kane serves the Main Shrine and Temporary Shrine with morning offerings, duty shrine parishioners serve the Secondary Shrines, and for the Small Shrines, Deputy Shrine Administrator Kiyoshi presents offerings at each location both morning and evening. Particularly for the Main Shrine, since offerings are presented both morning and evening, musicians perform music during these times.

- At the first part of the Hour of the Dragon (7-9 AM), the large drum is struck once, and after three announcements by the shrine attendants, everyone assembles at the council hall. The duty carpenters, blacksmiths, and others gather in front of the same location, and after everyone is assembled, they proceed to serve at the shrine grounds. Twenty-one shrine attendants [two of whom carry daily offerings] proceed in front, followed by Chief Priest Hirohisa and the three officials in attendance [the Chief Priest is accompanied by retainers in court dress and commoners, with umbrella bearers]. Next, the shrine priests and below proceed in groups, passing through the First and Second Torii gates, crossing the Sudoko Bridge and Tama Bridge, ascending through the tower gate and middle gate via the Chinese-style gate to the Negi side corridor. Following the usual sacred ritual procedure, the Chief Priest takes the center position, while the other shrine officials, both Negi and Hafuri sides, sit facing each other on the east and west sides of the same location. The Deputy Shrine Administrator sits at the end of the Negi side, and the Construction Superintendent sits on the west side of the small courtyard, positioned after the Ota Wakamiya shrine officials.

- Shortly before the above shrine officials' arrival, the construction supervisors take their seats in the feast hall [with tatami mats laid on the veranda, silk curtains to the north, and white cloth curtains to the south]. However, during the Kanpo era, they were seated in the record-keeping building, but since the Main Shrine's roof structure could not be seen from there, it was previously ordered that this time it should be set up in the feast hall. Accordingly, those at liberty gather in the west offering hall record-keeping building, and the musicians [in purification robes with decorative threading] take their seats in the west music hall. After everything is prepared, the roof-raising ceremony begins. The carpenters, from the head carpenter down, sit on the long bench under the eastern eaves of the record-keeping building [arranged in a single row facing north, with west as the upper position].

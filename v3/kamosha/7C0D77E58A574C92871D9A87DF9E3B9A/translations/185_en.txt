The above was left with an intermediary as Okajima was absent, then returned home.

One: Regarding this shrine reconstruction, Metsugane lacquer master's assistant cutting magistrate served in the official capacity, but in April
during the festival and other busy periods, he was additionally requested to serve outside his regular duties, so as a greeting, 100 hiki of money for side dishes
and one barrel of sake (5 shō capacity) were sent. Later, as thanks, Toshiuji came as a representative.
11th day (Mizunoto | Rabbit) Clear weather
One: Today at the hour of the Snake (around 8 AM), the inspector from the Eastern Office summoned representatives regarding the petition for departure to Kantō.
After consulting with Shimogamo, since there was no set departure date, we brought a petition merely inquiring about going down. As representative,
Yasuhisa and Kaneshige appeared and returned after the hour of the Sheep (around 2 PM). The report says: Upon visiting the Eastern Office, we met Nishio
Shintarō, who informed us that the Noh performance matter we reported earlier had been acknowledged. Taking this opportunity, depending on circumstances,
there might be another day of Noh dedication. When we inquired whether this matter should be reported,
he said it would indeed be proper to report it. At the Western Office, we met Tomiemon. Regarding the recent
matter of going down to Kantō, when we consulted with Shimogamo, they said they had not reported the departure matter from below, so
we revised the document and submitted it, asking for their favor. Also, when we mentioned that the Noh matter had been acknowledged at the Eastern Office as well, both [offices agreed].

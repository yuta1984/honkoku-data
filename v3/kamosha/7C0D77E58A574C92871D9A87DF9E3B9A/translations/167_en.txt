It was decided that cost estimation documents should be commissioned as appropriate
　One: Regarding the offering of three shō of sake and sea bream (two pieces) presented by the head priest as congratulatory gifts for the successful completion of the formal shrine relocation without incident
　　Decided that this should be reported to the full council
　One: The head priest's speech stated: Regarding congratulatory gifts to be given to various officials and those in charge for the successful completion of the formal shrine relocation in connection with the construction - how should this be handled? This was also done during the Shōtoku and Kanpō eras. However, since the government has reduced miscellaneous silver allowances by 30%, this time is different from the Shōtoku and Kanpō periods, so would it be appropriate to reduce gifts to those in charge by about 40%? Also, how should the matter of formal gratitude to the Eastern authorities and the Nō performance be handled?
　　The council's view: Since congratulatory gifts were also given during Shōtoku and Kanpō, unavoidable expenses should follow precedent, and other small amounts should be given as appropriate. The matter of formal gratitude to Eastern authorities is a special case, so immediate inquiry would be appropriate. However, the inquiry should be made after the formal relocation is completed. Regarding the Nō performance, this should be considered later.
　　　After this concluded, everyone dispersed

1. Two pine ritual officials wearing plain robes participated, but due to the narrow space with no place to burn [offerings], the shrine attendants burned pine torches far to the side in front of the shrine.
1. During the Kanpō era, when the end pathway was obstructed by rain, it was noted in the records that they should fold around from the great platform westward, partially demolish the stone platform on the south side below the temporary hall, extend a bridge from the end to the balustrade of the main shrine, and construct a temporary roof. Today preparations were made for this as well, but the weather remained fine until the divine relocation was completed, so it was unnecessary. Only a temporary roof over the curtained enclosure was constructed.
The portions omitted from the abbreviated procedures are roughly as follows:
1. Since the Controller's seating location was far from the pathway, Sōichi extinguished the lamps of the temporary hall in advance.
1. The Yin-Yang Master secretly entered through the north entrance of the sacred child's dwelling, passed through the worship hall, and performed body purification at the seat before the shrine in the courtyard. Of course, the sacred treasures were purified in the worship hall, and the divine offerings were purified after being carried and placed in the worship hall following the Controller's withdrawal.
1. After the divine relocation was completed, Sōichi approached like the yin-yang [master] and lit the sacred lamps.

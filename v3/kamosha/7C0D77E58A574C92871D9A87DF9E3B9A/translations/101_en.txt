　The above sequence was prepared and submitted to Controller Hinонishi on behalf of Imperial Messenger Kushige, the Grand Counselor, following the precedent of the Kanpō era. However, on the actual day, some modifications were made with prior notification.

1. The master carpenter wears purified robes and performs the metal fitting purification. He ascends from behind the head priest's seat via the connecting corridor to reach the sacred presence.
1. Shrine officials rotate their service to the shrine head, and according to the procedural document, the Bureau of Divination performs purification next, but on this occasion they served after the purification. Moreover, although the Bureau of Divination wished to perform purification rituals before the imperial messenger's arrival, the shrine declined this, and they performed it early.
1. Regarding the courtyard torches: Behind Sugino Shrine, the pine ritual official wears plain robes for his role.
　For the Main Palace Ministry's courtyard torches, two guards wearing court dress burn them in the small courtyard from before and after the divine relocation until the imperial messenger's departure. After withdrawal, the deputy advances to the small courtyard and holds torches as usual.
1. Regarding extinguishing the sacred lamps before the divine presence: The deputy representing the Ujirensōnegi advances from the connecting corridor to the small courtyard to perform this role. Of course, lighting them after the completion of the divine relocation is the same as above. The small deputy brings the fire to the lower edge of the connecting corridor.
1. The imperial messenger, as instructed beforehand until Hōshō, secretly [proceeds] to the front of the sacred temporary shelter before the divine relocation.

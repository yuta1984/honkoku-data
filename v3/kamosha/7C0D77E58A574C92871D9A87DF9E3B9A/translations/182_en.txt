Around half past the Hour of the Rooster, the representative Gyōkyūken, returning to his home province, brought ceremonial gifts to each of the officials, but since they were all absent, he left messages with their attendants.

Then we went to the Western Office and submitted the petition for courtesy visit to Kantō and the notification for the celebratory nō performance scheduled for the 18th. Shichikaya Gunzō came out and took them inside, and after a while came out and said that the nō performance notification should be submitted to the Eastern monthly duty office first, and if approved there, then submitted to the West, and so he returned our notification. Regarding the petition for the courtesy visit to Kantō, the document indicated a desire to depart around the 10th of the 11th month, but while this would be possible if the Administrator were in Kyoto, since the Administrator is currently in residence in Edo, it would be necessary to first petition Edo regarding this matter, then send notification of approval to Kyoto, then petition the Temples and Shrines Magistrate, and after receiving orders from the Temples and Shrines Magistrate to proceed to Edo at will, and after receiving a letter of introduction from the Kyoto office, this would take an enormous amount of time.

Then we went to the East and applied to the Inspector's Office, where Nishio Shintarō came out regarding the notification for the celebratory nō performance date—

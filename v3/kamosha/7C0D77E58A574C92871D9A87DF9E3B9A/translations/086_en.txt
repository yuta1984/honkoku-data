Representatives of Kamo Shrine Community
18th day of the 8th month, Year of the Rooster
Yamamoto Kazusa-no-suke Suenaga
Hayashi Yamato-no-kami Shigeuye

To: Lord Kushinada Dainagon
Lord Hinomishi Ben
Among the shrine administrators

The above petition was brought by Suenaga alone around half past the Hour of the Rooster. He explained to Daizen that since Yamato-no-kami was in ritual seclusion, he had come alone. He was told to wait while further consultation would be made with the magistrate and an inquiry submitted to His Lordship. While waiting in attendance, around the Hour of the Dog, Daizen appeared and said that the submitted petition had been presented to His Lordship, but since His Lordship had no particular thoughts on the matter, consultation with the military authorities would now commence, and this should be understood. After this, he went to visit Magistrate Ben-dono, where shrine administrator Inoue Tanomo appeared. Suenaga explained that since this concerned security matters requiring immediate attention, he had brought it directly to the Imperial Messenger. The Imperial Messenger was to consult with the magistrate. However, what was just conveyed by the Imperial Messenger was that when the inquiry was made to His Lordship, since he had no particular thoughts, consultation with military authorities would now take place, and this report was submitted.

19th day (Cloudy, rain from around the Hour of the Monkey until past the Hour of the Rooster, then clearing)
Before the Hour of the Rabbit, a letter came from Nishio Shintaro and Mano Hachirobye stating that yoriki and doshin from both East and West would be dispatched for guard duty regarding the Imperial Messenger's visit, and requesting that one representative come immediately. At the same time, the West Office also sent word that a representative should come. Accordingly, Shiaki went as representative and returned around the Hour of the Horse to report: First, upon going to the West Office, Irie Zenbye appeared and said that regarding security for the formal relocation ceremony, since the Shoshidai position was vacant and the matter was entirely under inquiry with the Eastern authorities, no security would be provided. However, last night the Imperial Messenger stated that it would be problematic if any unfortunate incidents occurred at such an important shrine, so security could not be provided as such.

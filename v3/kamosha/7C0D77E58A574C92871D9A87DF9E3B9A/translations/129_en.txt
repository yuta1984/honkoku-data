At present, since the magistrate position is vacant and lanterns cannot be provided from the official office, it was communicated that the shrine community would arrange for the stands and other equipment this time, with the specific items listed in a written document that was handed over. Although the matter was also discussed with the magistrate's office, they indicated that the request should be made directly to the shrine, and if it were not accepted, there could be official orders from the magistrate's office.

Regarding the above, Kiei went to the council chamber for consultation, and it was decided that since the magistrate position is vacant and if refused it would become a matter for official orders from the magistrate's office, it would be best to comply. Kiei gave his acknowledgment to Rokurōemon. Of course, this should not become a repeated precedent, and it was agreed that this should be recorded in their records and well documented within the shrine community.

Item 1: Today at the hour of yotsu (around 10 AM), a summons arrived from the West Magistrate's Office requesting that one representative attend. Accordingly, Kaneshige went as the representative. At this time, he first visited the magistrate and inquired about the list of participants for the formal relocation ceremony of Kifune inner and outer shrines, whereupon he was given written instructions, which were recorded on folded official paper.

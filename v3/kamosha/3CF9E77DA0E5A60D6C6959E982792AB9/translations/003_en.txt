　　　　　Spring Horses　　　　Prince-Priest Second Rank of Ninnaji Temple
When spring arrives at the burned field where bush clover sprouts, even the horses' appearance changes completely
　　　　　　　　　　　Former Archbishop Kakuchū
Though these are horses that make bird-like sounds to people, they have grown tame among the young reeds
　　　　　　　　　　　Kamo no Toshihira
The spring horses grazing in herds at distant Osono mingle with the burned field in the offing
　　　　at Yodo's marsh edge variant【red】　　Kinkira Ason
　　　　　　　　released variant【red】
　　　　　walking in the meadow variant【red】
At the field's edge where wild rice grows　　　　spring horses roughly trample the grass, mistaking it for their own shadow
　　variant has no title【red】
　　　Fujiwara no Chikamori composed on the topic "Spring Horses in One's Hometown"
When spring comes to the hedge and stream of my old village, the horses' appearance seems even more desolate

Shikashū Spring　Monk-Administrator Kakuga
Only with the sprouting grass leaves,
at the hills and marsh plains, the horses' appearance
has become spring-like

Goshūishū Spring (first part)　Minamoto no Kanenaga
Standing apart at the marsh edge,
do the spring horses see
their own shadows as companions?

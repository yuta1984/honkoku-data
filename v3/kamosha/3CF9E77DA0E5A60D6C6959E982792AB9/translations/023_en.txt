The ox shakes off the snow-hat that falls upon it, troubling the later travelers with snow

Composed on the sentiment of year's end at a travel lodging - Minamoto no Moromitsu

Composed on changing seasonal robes - Imperial Consort's Household Minister Shunzei

Gyoku (Gyokuyō-shū marking)
How quickly the flower-adorned sleeves have changed! Though it is the custom to change with the seasons

Fujiwara no Akiyasu, Court Noble
Changing over, how quickly I have donned these white layered robes - they have become summer garments

Fujiwara no Teika

Gusō (Shūi Gusō marking)
Even on sleeves that should have hearts to feel regret, no trace of flowers remains

I removed today these sleeves that bore flowers so briefly, though my melancholy self had no time for frivolity

【Upper notation】
This poem is not in Shūi Gusō. I think the author must have omitted it.

Monk Shōshun
What suddenly cuts off spring longings is the cicada's wing-robe that does not mind the wind

Composed on changing seasonal robes when people composed ten poems each at Lord Shunzei's house

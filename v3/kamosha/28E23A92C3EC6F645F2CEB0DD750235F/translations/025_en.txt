Respectfully submitted

Regarding the wood construction commencement date for our shrine's reconstruction, we have made inquiries and prepared this for your honorable review:

Second month, 3rd day - Kanoe-ne (Metal Rat)
Same month, 4th day - Kinoto-ushi (Metal Ox)  
Same month, 5th day - Mizunoe-tora (Water Tiger)

We humbly inquire about these three days. If the date and time could be promptly designated, the entire shrine community would be most grateful. The above.

As written above, following precedent, three days have been submitted, but according to our shrine's yin-yang diviner, the 3rd and 4th days are auspicious. Therefore, we have privately submitted one accompanying document, using formal paper folded horizontally. The record is as follows:

Memorandum
1. Regarding the wood construction commencement date and time, we inquire as stated in the separate document. During the Kanpō era, both shrines executed on the same day, but this time there are also military considerations, so we would like different days to be designated.

1. Following precedent, we have submitted three days for the schedule, but for the execution deadline, we request that it be designated within the two days of the 3rd and 4th. Regarding the timing, when we consulted within the shrine, both days appear favorable for the hours of tatsu-mi (Dragon-Snake, 7-9 AM to 1-3 PM). We would like to execute during the mi hour (1-3 PM) within these two days. The above.

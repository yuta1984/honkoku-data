The next day, after the Tsuchi-no-ge Festival sacred ritual was completed, it was withdrawn. Those making voluntary pilgrimages were:
　(Attire was at their discretion) Chief hafuri Shigeuji (court dress), deputy negi Yasuhisa (court dress), hafuri Hōrei (court dress)
　Kifune negi Yasukyū (pure robes), Wakamiya negi Chikuaki (court dress), hafuri Motoyasu (court dress)

　Ujigami negi Jūshun (court dress), hafuri Kaneyasu (pure robes), and others including Ichiken, Kabuken,
　Suhō, Kaneshige, headman Suetsuna, Shikihisa, etc.
First, due to rain tonight, temporary roof coverings for the pathways were provided by the repair office.
　29th day, cloudy
First, this is the Tsuchi-no-ge Festival sacred ritual. Since the removal from the temporary hall was difficult, and after consultation among the shrine officials at the shrine grounds, the shrine officials from the negi group went to the hafuri group to transfer the divine offerings. Specifically, only the sacred chopsticks and cups were transferred by the hands of the negi group's shrine officials, while the sacred rice and other items were offered by the hafuri group's shrine officials as usual, following precedent.

First, since the bridge construction for the Hosodono negi quarters was not yet completed, the divine offering procession entered through the Second Torii, proceeding from Hashimoto Shrine via Kusu Bridge to the building for official use at the tax office through Shingu Gate.
　The yin-yang purification was performed at the base of Kusu Bridge to purify the bodies of the shrine officials. The purification was conducted in the corridor as on the 15th day of the first month. The shrine officials assembled at the shrine grounds. This matter was communicated to the shrine officials by the chief priest, and to various functionaries by the supervisors.
First, regarding the procedure for presenting divine offerings to the inner sanctuary now that Shingu, Nara, Sawada shrines and others were enshrined in temporary halls, consultations were held at the communion hall. The chief priest and others questioned whether it was appropriate to present inner sanctuary offerings to the outer sanctuary without opening the sacred doors, or whether the sacred doors should be left open while offerings were presented to the outer sanctuary, and it was decided to proceed as described above. Although Kanetame had mentioned that during the Kanpō period, specifically during the Tsuchi-no-ge Festival ritual, offerings were made without opening the sacred doors, the general consensus was that not opening the sacred doors was questionable, so the procedure was conducted as described above. However, it was roughly decided that decorative items other than hollyhock should be stored in the country residence upon withdrawal.

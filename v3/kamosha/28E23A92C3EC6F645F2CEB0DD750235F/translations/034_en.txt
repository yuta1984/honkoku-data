After the evening offerings were removed, at the御局 (divine quarters), from the head priest down to all those who came to worship at will, there was a ceremony where they viewed the imperial edict, and there were rituals including sacred food sharing (naorai) and ceremonial sake cups, after which they made pilgrimages to various shrines and dispersed.

The procedure was as follows: First, the shrine attendants were ordered to set up seating at the divine quarters《marginal: by order of the administrative officer》. One mat was placed in the center of the western area, three mats each to the left and right, and long benches were laid out for the remainder. The head priest sat in the center, the negi (senior priests) to the south, the hafuri (priests) to the north《marginal: each facing east》, the assistant negi and below sat in the southern seats of the negi section《marginal: western precedence, facing north》, the assistant hafuri and below sat in the northern seats of the hafuri section《marginal: western precedence, facing south》, and the yin-yang master, deputy administrator, proxy administrator, purification leaders, and those who came to worship at will were seated separately on the left and right.

The imperial edict was placed in a viewing box and the administrative officer carried it around to be viewed by all, starting with the head priest, then the senior negi, then the senior hafuri, and extending to all shrine officials and clan members. After each person's viewing ceremony was completed, the morning and evening sacred offerings were placed in the sacred chest and brought by the tōne attendants, and distributed in order starting from the head priest. Each person was given one cup《marginal: third-grade earthenware》 for the naorai feast. Next, sacred sake《marginal: served in sake pots and serving vessels》 was distributed by the tōne attendants, and after three rounds of offerings, the ceremony concluded and everyone dispersed. Notably, for today's sacred food sharing ceremony upon the deity's departure, the administrative officer did not participate, and the sacred sake and earthenware vessels were also (supplied) by the construction office.

They wear pure white robes and pointed trousers, with one attendant in white robes assigned to each. These individuals enter through the Nara Stone Bridge and the second torii gate, cross the Negi Bridge (priests and ritualists together in one group), the priest faction and rotating service personnel cross the Jewel Bridge and enter through the tower middle gate, taking their seats in the transparent corridor. The ritualist faction passes through the crossing corridor lower bridge, enters through the Shingū sacred gate, arrives at the Chinese gate and proceeds to the eastern crossing hall. The rotating service personnel take their places in the western corridor, arranged in two rows. Two pine ceremony officials (wearing plain robes) burn braziers in the front courtyard of the western offering hall. Those at liberty take their places in the communion hall. However, former head priest Hoshō takes his seat west of the temporary hall's edge board, above the rotating service personnel. Most importantly, after the relocation ceremony is completed, he withdraws from his seat. Regarding inspection matters for all directions in connection with the supervising officials: After preparations are complete, the head priest summons the administrator inside the Chinese gate and announces that the sacred offerings should be dispatched. Next, the sacred offerings are dispatched from the offering hall. The yin-yang practitioner performs purification as usual at the base of the Jewel Bridge. Next, the yin-yang practitioner proceeds to the eastern and western corridors to purify the bodies of the shrine officials. Next, he receives the sacred key of the temporary hall and passes it to the senior ritualist. Next, the senior ritualist opens the sacred doors of the new

temporary hall, completes this task, and returns to his seat. Next, the representative deputy advances to the small courtyard and holds a torch. Next, he receives the sacred key of the main hall and passes it to the senior ritualist. Next, the senior ritualist opens the sacred doors, everyone moves from their seats and prostrates themselves. From here the sequence is as follows. The abbreviated sequence is determined after consultation among shrine officials at the retreat quarters.

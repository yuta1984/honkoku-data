For the main shrine's temporary hall, the duty priest also serves the subsidiary shrines; the duty personnel serve the small shrines; Kiyu of the shrine affairs office serves them; and for Kifune small shrine, Kunisada, the daily attendant and purification deputy, prepares offerings. However, for the main shrine's evening offerings, after relocation to the temporary hall, both high officials prepare them.

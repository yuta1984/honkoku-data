The inquiry notification to the Imperial Messenger was completed, and he returned home after the hour of the Rooster, giving a report. He went to see the Imperial Messenger, submitting through an intermediary the inquiry document about the wood construction commencement date and time, along with memoranda. Subsequently, in a direct audience, the Imperial Messenger stated that he had acknowledged the content of the written document regarding the wood construction commencement matter. In that case, would any number of days be acceptable? Therefore, following precedent, three days were written down, but they wished to execute it within either the 3rd or 4th day.

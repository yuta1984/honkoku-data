The content was that the shrine representatives were summoned to the Non-Chamberlain's Office, so immediately the representatives Sokukyū and Kiei departed and returned home after the tori hour (5-7 PM). When they appeared at the Non-Chamberlain's Office, the Imperial messenger and magistrate were in attendance, and what was announced was as follows:

1. Regarding the wood construction commencement ceremony, it is designated for the 27th of this month at the mi hour (9-11 AM)

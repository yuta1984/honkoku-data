There was no particular preparation, and after the shrine officials' arrival, the general representative Kaneshige went to the rest facility and requested that matters proceed as convenient. During this sequence, when asked whether they would withdraw to the first torii as originally planned when departing from the office building, they replied that this was indeed the case. Also, one ladle needed for the purification area at the sake hall was lent through the shrine's goodwill.

1. Upon receiving notification that the imperial edict messenger had arrived at the rest facility, the head priest and others departed from the council hall to attend their duties. First, one shrine servant proceeded in the center, followed by twenty people in two rows《marginal: specifically ten people each》, then the head priest《marginal: attendants as noted above》, with the bettō, shoshi, and mokudai following, then after a gap of about three ken, the senior negi and twenty others proceeded in a group《marginal: attendants as noted above》.
They entered through the area between the bathhouse earthworks, passed through the third torii, crossed the stone bridge, and entered the second torii. The head priest passed through the negi declaration area via the bamboo bridge, jewel bridge, and others, arriving at his seat at the tower gate. The other shrine officials arrived at the earthen building《marginal: however, during Shōtoku-Kanpō periods, they crossed the wooden bridge and arrived at the earthen platform from Sugiwara. Also, the shrine servants should have stopped outside the second torii, but this time they stopped under the eaves of the tower gate - was this an oversight by the head priest?》

1. When the appointed time arrived, the imperial edict messenger《marginal: each in sokutai court dress》and deputy messenger approached, with the messenger assistant《marginal: in cloth hitatare》carrying the document register and proceeding first. They first crossed the sake hall bridge, completed purification at the purification area, proceeded along the main path to the first torii《marginal: at this time holding the lower hem with the left hand》. At this time, the onmyō-dayū had his plain-robed attendant carry the inspection box and proceed in advance to the vicinity of the imperial residence building. When the messenger appeared near the sake hall bridge, he emerged from the western section of the imperial residence and proceeded toward the front first torii《marginal: with the court dress attendant carrying the inspection box proceeding first》. They waited on the east side of the torii, then the messenger bowed once and entered the torii. Accordingly, the onmyō-dayū came out to greet them at the first torii with one bow, and after the messenger returned the bow, the onmyō-dayū took hemp and purified the principal messenger's body, then did the same for the deputy messenger. After mutual bows, they withdrew and proceeded to the tower gate, purifying the head priest's body. Next, the messenger《marginal: with the deputy messenger in goose formation on the left side》bowed once and entered the second torii《marginal: from this point trailing their hems》.
《marginal: They proceeded to under the southern eaves of the bridge hall, completed one bow at the center of the carriage entrance, ascended to the hall, took their place on the eastern tatami facing west, bowed, took their seated position, and arranged their hems. This was indeed the later arrival. This seating area was arranged by shrine servants under the direction of the shoshi-dayū, with two tatami mats set facing each other east and west between the third and fourth pillars, using red-bordered tatami from the bathhouse, with the eastern seat for the messenger and western seat for the head priest, the two seats separated by about three shaku》. At this time, the deputy messenger stood at the southwestern part of the bridge hall, observed the messenger's seating, tucked away his ritual tablet, and held the inspection box《marginal: handed over by the messenger assistant》. Responding to the messenger's demeanor, he ascended from the southern steps, placed the inspection box before the principal messenger, and withdrew《marginal: however, after placing the inspection box, he held his ritual tablet}}. He withdrew and stood at his original position. Next, the head priest rose from his seat at the tower gate, crossed the jewel bridge, and proceeded to below the northern steps of the bridge hall《marginal: at this time the bettō, shoshi, and mokudai followed the head priest, and after the head priest's ascension to the hall, they stood together under the northern eaves on the western side of the bridge hall. The plain-robed attendant holding the inspection box waited behind the shoshi》.

6th day (Kanoto-Ushi) Clear weather
1　Today at the hour of the Snake, the ceremonial first sewing of sacred vestments was performed at the head priest's residence. Head priest Hirohisa (wearing hunting robe), sacred vestment commissioners Shigeshoku, Kenaki, Kaneyasu, and Kanesato, sacred vestment office deputy Yoshisue (substitute) Yasutaka each wore purification robes. Sashinuki administrator deputy Kiyotaka and deputy representative Taruaki substitute Kenken (wearing purification robes) participated, and there was a sake offering ceremony. The ritual involved three stacked earthenware vessels, five cuts of dried abalone (small square cuts), five cuts of kelp (small square cuts) arranged on a ceremonial tray, which the administrator and deputy brought before the head priest. Beginning with the head priest, it was passed to his wife, then from the wife to the five senior sacred vestment ladies in order of seniority. From the senior ladies to the sacred vestment commissioners, from the commissioners to the sacred vestment office deputy (with administrators and deputies serving as handlers), from the deputy to the administrator, from the administrator to the deputy, with both handling it mutually. Next came the cutting ceremony, where the head priest, his wife, and the senior sacred vestment ladies worked together to perform the first cutting of winter court robes, winter ceremonial robes, large-sleeved undergarments, lined robes, etc. Each followed the prescribed format. However, during the Shōtoku and Kanpō eras, the first cutting was performed with summer court robes and summer ceremonial robes, but this time the weaving was not completed, so winter court robes and winter ceremonial robes were used for the first cutting.

Two scraping boards, two measuring sticks, two cutting knives, one small knife, two bamboo rulers, and fabric for two sets of court robes and ceremonial robes were each placed on spreading paper in front of the platform. Washed rice was placed in two earthenware vessels, and a bundle of dried abalone was placed on a ceremonial tray and offered to the head priest and his wife, followed by the recitation of ritual prayers. At that time everyone prostrated themselves, and afterward each offered sacred food according to the direct sharing protocol. The ritual master wore formal court dress and served as the carrier. Next, the first sewing began with the court curtains. Following tradition, after the noon and evening banquets were completed, everyone dispersed after half past the hour of the Monkey. The senior sacred vestment ladies who participated in the service were as follows:

　　Head priest's wife Hae-onna (wearing chihaya, hair down, painted eyebrows, sash and below the same), from the Narinaga house Yorishi's wife Mio-onna, from the Sadaaki house Sadaaki's mother Mio-onna, from the Shiaki house Kyōaki's mother Sachi-onna, from the Ujio house Ujio's daughter Michi-onna, from the Kensei house Nawasue's sister Michi-onna

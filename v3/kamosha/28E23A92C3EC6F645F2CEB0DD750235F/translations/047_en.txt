Besides the above, there are about ten people participating at their own discretion. However, sacred meal communions and such are also held.

1. Nine people including head and assistant carpenters, head and assistant master builders, and five foremen are to attend (each wearing folded court caps [however, head and assistant carpenters wear hunting dress], purification robes with hakama)

1. Due to the gate tower construction being at its height, from the day gate to the communion hall, shrine officials and others each gather, and from there proceed before the main shrine and Wakamiya shrine. Shrine officials sit on round mats under the eaves north of the Chinese gate (arranged north to south, facing east). The construction supervisor sits under the southeastern eaves of the new shrine worship hall. Those participating at their discretion sit on long platforms south of the Chinese gate. Carpenters wait on the western side of the new shrine gate, arranged west to east facing north. They have no formal seating.

1. Those appearing today are: supervisors Yasunao and Yasutake, general overseers Moriyasu, Hisayasu, and Uketoshi, administrators Suehide, Kaneshige, Fumiaki and others (each in hunting dress). However, the two administrators and Fumiaki and others will guide when Lord Yamamura and others come before the shrine. Lord Yamamura and others will be seated in the temporary building on the eastern side. The northern room for Lord Yamamura and Edo officials, the next room for yoriki and doshin, and the southern temporary building for the master builders.

For the above official seating, as ordered by the responsible officials to lay floor boards and set up tatami mats in the temporary building beforehand, the curtained enclosure from the sacred birth place is to be used. This is to be handled by the repair department, details as shown in the diagram.

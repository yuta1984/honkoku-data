Second Month, Tsuchinoe-Tatsu, Clear Skies

First, Ceremonial Day Meeting
　First, like in the Kanpō era, it was decided that except for the purification rituals of the festival, the inner sanctuary doors would not be opened and offerings would be made from the outer sanctuary. However, when the inner sanctuary doors are opened during the festival, only the sacred hollyhock would be offered to the inner sanctuary from the outer sanctuary, while the inner sanctuary offerings and daily imperial provisions would be offered in that outer sanctuary. After completing the norito prayers, the eight-legged altar offerings in the outer sanctuary and the courtyard provisions would be offered, and it was decided that the norito prayers should be performed twice.

　First, a schedule document for the temporary relocation of the subsidiary shrines was submitted by the chief priest as follows:
　　　Kajita, Shōjin Temple Guardian Shrine, Jingū Temple Guardian Shrine
　　　　　The above between the 4th and 5th days
　　　Shirahige, Hyakudayū, Guardian Shrine, Fukutoku
　　　　　The above between the 6th and 7th days

　　　　　The above on the 9th day

　　　Kibune Provisional Hall procession and ten subsidiary shrines
　　　　　The above on the 14th and 15th days

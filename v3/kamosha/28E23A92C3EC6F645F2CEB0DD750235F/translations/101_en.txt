Since it was heard that even during the Kanpō period there were no magistrates in attendance, it was decided that no officials needed to report for duty, so such preparations were unnecessary.

1. From around the hour of the Monkey (3-5 PM), various officials gradually proceeded to the inner shrine: Deputy Head Kaneyasu, Administrator (deputy) Yasuhiro, Deputy Administrator (deputy) Kanekata, Yin-yang Master Akira, Workshop (deputy) Kanejun, and others. Additionally, two pine ceremony officials and Assistant Head Carpenter Masayuki also ascended the mountain slightly.

1. The contractors separated the main hall from the shrine foundation, lifted the hall about 4-5 sun (12-15 cm), inserted floor boards, bound it with logs running through the pillars, attached hemp ropes of medium quality running through the foundation, wound them at the high eastern area, laid twelve new bridge boards brought up from Kamo on top of the floor boards, attached ten pulley ropes brought along from all four sides of the hall to the foundation, and planned to pull eastward with the valley shrine servants doing the hauling. Although much additional timber was needed, since the contractors brought materials from the construction supplies, there was no need for the shrine association to provide separate timber.

1. A five-shō barrel with woven goods was given to the contractors, and it was announced that the celebratory money of three kan would be given at Kamo. Regarding the method of moving the hall, since the valley people primarily perform this duty, they should be made to pull the main ropes, while others should provide rhythmic clapping. The day laborers were to wear white court dress, while the contractors and supervisors were to wear plain jackets, and they were instructed to appear after the hour of the Boar (9-11 PM). They respectfully acknowledged this and retired to the valley rest area after half an hour.

1. High lanterns were erected at two locations north of the retreat quarters and one at the south entrance.

1. The attendants lowered the lion-dogs from the worship hall, and after the moving was completed, they were placed back on the great platform as before.

1. Regarding laying straw matting on the moving route, the general magistrates deliberated and arranged it. From the west of the main hall to the east of the boat stone, through the middle passage of the worship hall to the eastern stone wall, white curtains were to be hung in a single layer, and they were also to be hung above the rear stone wall, but due to rain this was not necessary.

1. Around half past the hour of the Boar, the ceremony was initiated. From the inner retreat quarters, the procession began with two shrine servants (from West Kamo) carrying torches, followed by the sword bearer, offering bearer, head priest and both officials (in court dress), the deputy head, administrator, and deputy administrator (in white robes), and two attendants (in white robes and sashiguki) proceeding to the divine presence. At the western side under the eaves of the worship hall, facing north, the head priest, then both officials, then the attendants knelt outside the curtains, or under the eastern eaves of the worship hall. The general magistrates, yin-yang officials, the three offices, and other worshippers took their seats on round cushions, long platforms, etc. Near the boat stone were the pine ceremony officials and garden torches; the pine ceremony officials wore plain jackets.

Procedure:
First, the head priest performed hand purification (administrator's role, wearing chihaya), both shrines the same. Next, the yin-yang master performed purification in front of the sacred ground. Next, after the priest completed the purification of the rear path, the valley shrine servants and side-entering attendants (in yellow robes, upper and lower garments) took hold of the hall's ropes. The contractors, in plain jackets and white court dress, went around the hall or to the base of the hemp ropes, each taking their positions, with the general magistrate giving orders. Next, the attendants extinguished the sacred lamps, temporarily removed them, extinguished the worship hall lamps, and extinguished the garden torches.

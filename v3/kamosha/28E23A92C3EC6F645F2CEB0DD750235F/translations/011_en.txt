9th day, clear weather
1. After the hour of Rabbit, representatives Head Priest Hakubun and Deputy Kiei appeared. The purpose was due to a summons from the Western Government Office last night.
Temple representatives Senjuin and Hokoin also appeared, returning home around the hour of Rooster and giving a speech. At exactly the hour of Dragon,
they appeared at the Western Government Office and made their request to the officials in charge. At noon they met Mano Hachirobei, and were guided that the Kamo Upper and Lower representatives and temple monk representatives should proceed, and they went through to the special reception room. The Shimogamo representatives also

took the same seats. Subsequently, there was an audience with Lord Shinano-no-kami, who conveyed: "Regarding the reconstruction and restoration of this shrine,
it has been ordered as requested, and this is conveyed through this document." The aforementioned document was given by Irie Kichibei to both shrine representatives.
Therefore, after viewing it, they expressed their gratitude and withdrew. The aforementioned document was as follows: {{marginal note: written on a separate paper}}

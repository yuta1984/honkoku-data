He bowed once and ascended from the northern steps, taking his place at the western seat《marginal: both eastern and western seats were later arrivals》. He performed a seated bow, settled into his position, and arranged his hem. Next, the messenger shifted his position《marginal: at this time the head priest also shifted his position》, took the inspection box and pushed it toward the head priest. Then the head priest respectfully took the imperial edict, removed the ceremonial paper from inside the inspection box, secretly unfolded it, held it up in the center, and examined it. Upon completion, when expressing his acknowledgment, the messenger responded to the head priest's demeanor, and as before, added the ceremonial paper back and placed it in the inspection box《marginal: however, during the Shōtoku-Kanpō periods, at this time a shoshi officer brought an inspection box, so the head priest transferred and placed the imperial edict. This time there was no such procedure, and it was to be brought to the divine presence together with the inspection box brought by the messenger》. Next, the shoshi-dayū ascended from the northern steps《marginal: at this time he removed his small sword and had his attendant carry it》, took the inspection box from before the head priest, and descended the northern steps《marginal: however, he waited for the head priest to rise from his seat》.

Next, the head priest bowed once, rose from his seat, and descended the northern steps《marginal: at this time the messenger bowed once and descended the southern steps》, proceeding to the divine presence via the jewel bridge, tower gate, middle gate, and so forth. At this time, the shoshi-dayū carried the inspection box and proceeded first《marginal: about one ken ahead of the head priest; during rain ceremonies, he had someone carry a red umbrella》. The bettō-dayū, mokudai-dayū, and others followed in attendance, and at the front of the Chinese-style gate, they took the imperial edict carried by the shoshi-dayū《marginal: the inspection box remained in the hands of the shoshi-dayū》, ascended from the Chinese-style gate, approached the divine presence, and placed it on the sacred offering table《marginal: the sacred offering table had been placed on the great platform beforehand; bowing was performed as usual》. At the earthen platform, he recited the ritual prayer and clapped his hands《marginal: as usual》. Upon completion, he approached the great platform, removed the imperial edict, and withdrew to the priest's transit hall. At this time, the shoshi-dayū carried the inspection box, entered through the compound's main gate, and approached near the steps of the transit hall. Accordingly, the head priest handed over the imperial edict, completed the procedure, and descended from the eastern end of the transit hall《marginal: at this time the shoe-bearing attendant entered the small courtyard area》. He exited through the compound's main gate.

Prior to this, the other shrine officials had each risen from the earthen building, passed through the transit hall, and from the direction of the new shrine arrived at the front of the young shrine, lining up near Hajio Shrine. Both messengers also passed through the negi quarters via the bamboo bridge, jewel bridge, tower gate, middle gate, and so forth, stopping under the northern eaves. Next, the head priest passed in front of the standing sand, proceeded to the steps of the Chinese-style gate, faced both messengers and bowed once; after the messengers returned the bow, he withdrew to the shrine head. Next, the senior negi and nineteen other shrine officials each proceeded to the front of the Chinese-style gate, formed a single line facing both messengers, bowed once, and after the messengers completed their return bow, each withdrew to the shrine head. Next, both messengers withdrew from the divine presence《marginal: at this time the inspection box was returned from the shoshi-dayū to the messenger assistant, and the imperial edict was transferred and placed in the shrine's inspection box》and took their seats in the office hall《marginal: two zassho officials accompanied them as guides; the seating in the office building had been arranged beforehand by the chief administrator. They raised the shutters, hung curtain screens, and partitioned the space above the cutting boards with white curtains》. The principal messenger took the lateral seat facing east《marginal: one red-bordered tatami mat was set》, the deputy messenger took the southern seat facing north《marginal: tatami as above》, and the messenger assistant took the next seat, separated by a folding screen《marginal: facing north; the tatami was two mats according to previous precedent, but this time one mat was set. However, for future visits, it will be two mats》.

Once seating was determined, the hospitality ceremony took place as follows:
First offering of three cups《marginal: three times, three earthenware vessels placed on three stands}} served with accompaniments《marginal: dried abalone and kelp each placed in small containers, set on flat serving trays with white chopsticks added}} and sacred sake《marginal: served in a sake pot with side dishes added}}. Four tōne attendants provided service, and at this time one zassho official offered greetings.

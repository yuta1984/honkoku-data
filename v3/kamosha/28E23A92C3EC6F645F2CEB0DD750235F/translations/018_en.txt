Since the time for the temporary enshrinement had arrived, first following recent precedent, the head priest performed the duties. Thereafter, examining the precedents and evidence from several occasions before the formal enshrinement, when discussions resumed, since the former established custom was clear, it would be proper for those shrine officials to perform the duties.

Regarding the formal enshrinement, each shrine official was informed by the head priest that they should conduct their respective enshrinement ceremonies, and each performed their duties. Regarding the temporary enshrinement, during the Shōtoku era those shrine officials requested to perform both formal and temporary enshrinements. It was heard that the head priest had no particular objections, but one or two among the five officials disagreed, and it is understood that this is how the matter was settled. During the Kanpō era, there were even private discussions with the head priest, but it is unclear what the true intentions of the subsidiary shrine officials were, as they did not appear to be strongly petitioning. With such developments, it becomes naturally difficult to return to former precedent, and instead new precedent continues, ultimately leading to the discontinuation of former precedent, which is lamentable. First and foremost, if these are the duties of shrine officials who have been appointed for such occasions, this is extremely regrettable. Of course, since we perform the formal enshrinement properly, we are prepared to handle the temporary enshrinement as a matter of course.

In any case, after thorough discussion within the shrine, we petition that all formal and temporary enshrinements of subsidiary shrines be performed by imperially appointed shrine officials, and request favorable consideration. While matters concerning those among the head priest and five officials who are not informed could be settled within the shrine, there will surely be desires [from various parties]. If so, we would like both parties' wishes to be inquired about up to the Imperial Liaison Office. In any case, once orders are given, all shrine officials will have no second thoughts and will be at peace regardless. If this matter is left as is, future shrine officials will unavoidably commit regrettable transgressions, and the shame that will remain in future records would be extremely mortifying, so we cannot help but make this petition. Though the shrine is very busy, if you could provide appropriate judgment, all shrine officials would be deeply grateful. The above.

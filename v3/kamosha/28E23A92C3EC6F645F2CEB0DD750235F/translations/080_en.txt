(Among these, two lower-ranking attendants served as substitutes for shrine attendants) In addition, eleven laborers were used to transport divine offerings' Chinese-style boxes, divine treasure ceremonial beds, Chinese-style boxes, curtains, mat pathways, and various other ceremonial items. The specific items are recorded in the entry from the 11th, so they are omitted here.
Item: For the divine treasure procession of Kifune provisional hall, daily offerings were prepared and presented to the subsidiary shrines: Kifune, Oku shrine, Hashi-Gonden, and four small shrines. However, for the main shrine, the duty priest Naruhisa served; for subsidiary shrines, the duty clan member served; for Kifune Oku-Hashi-Gonden, etc., negi Ikuhisa served (daily offerings as on festival days, but only morning offerings). For the temporary relocation's four small shrines, ceremonial provider Kiyoyoshi prepared and presented offerings.
Item: Among the forty-two people carrying the daily offering Chinese-style boxes of our shrine, two lower-ranking tōne served because shrine attendants could not participate due to flooding and lack of bridges.
Item: Around half past the hour of Tatsu (7:30-8:00 AM), our shrine's daily offerings were presented. After completing the presentation at Taguchi shrine, they climbed the mountain to Kifune.
Item: Of the six meal offerings for Oku-Hashi-Gonden daily offerings, three were for the head priest and both officials, and three were for the direct communion of those in attendance.
Item: During the day, the interior decoration was completed from Musubi shrine through the provisional hall of Gonden to Suzuka shrine, and they withdrew to the duty station.

Item: Around half past the hour of Saru (4:30-5:00 PM), for the divine treasure procession, the head priest in formal court dress, both officials in court caps and robes, both ceremonial providers in pure white pierced garments, and the onmyōji, magistrate, chief priest, and deputy came from the duty station to serve. The head priest, both officials, ceremonial providers, etc. sat on circular mats outside the inner curtains, while the onmyōji and below sat outside the curtained area. Next, the divine treasure procession ceremony took place, and after completion, three-sun offerings were prepared and presented, with the negi providing them (the ritual priests, ceremonial providers, etc. performed the ceremonial escort). After completion, both officials withdrew to the duty station (although they should have accompanied the removal, due to heavy rain it was done this way). Next, they proceeded to the inner sanctuary of the provisional hall, both ceremonial providers advanced, and all the altar divine treasures and sacred implements were removed in order (the precedent is to transport divine treasures and sacred implements to the worship hall one by one, but due to today's heavy rain, two red-lacquered Chinese-style boxes and one plain wood long storage box were carried by valley shrine attendants to below the earthwork. Through the arrangements of Yasuaki and Kanemochi, they were stored in three containers, raised to the edge worship hall, inspected, and daily records were attached, then carried by laborers. Both officials descended the mountain, and because the Ichihara River bridge was unreliable, two valley shrine attendants were sent as escorts to the bridge for confirmation, etc.).
Item: At the hour of Tori (5-7 PM), the temporary relocation of Suzuka shrine, then Kawao shrine, then Gyūichi shrine, then Musubi shrine was completed without delay around the hour of Ne (11 PM-1 AM). At the shrine maiden's house, three meal offerings for Oku-Hashi divine offerings and three-sun offerings for the four small shrines were each shared in direct communion (however, duty guards, general cloth attendants, etc. also participated in direct communion).
　The interior decorations of Kawao, Gyūichi, and other shrine buildings were installed before the relocation, etc.

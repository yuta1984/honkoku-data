Upon inspection, regarding the shrine framework preparation that began yesterday with the foundation work, there was significant rot around the rear foundation supports, and when examined through gaps in the boards, the interior was found to be severely rotted, making it impossible to move the entire foundation structure together. The contractor conducted thorough examinations and reported that the foundation repair work could not be completed in one day, so it was decided to leave the foundation in place, install framework and pulling timber around the pillars, move only the main hall first, and then move the foundation afterward, as there was no other feasible method. Therefore, they urgently ascended the mountain and assigned the head carpenter to conduct an inspection.

1. Since the head priest, both officials, and others urgently ascended the mountain, and it would be difficult to begin work without presenting ritual offerings for the attachment and hauling, they changed into formal court dress at the temporary quarters and took their seats in the worship hall: the head priest in the center, the priest to the west, the ritualist to the east, two fallen-offering attendants on the east side, and three people facing south for the daily offering presentation. The priest prepared the offerings, the ritualist served as supervisor, along with two other fallen-offering attendants (in white robes and sashiguki), Taguchi Sosai (in white robes), and the toneji and shrine servants who recited prayers in the worship hall. The head priest and both officials held a communion feast at the shrine maiden's house, but due to urgency, they held the feast together at the inner shrine location before proceeding to the inner shrine. The morning offerings were as usual.

1. When the head carpenter was consulted about the inner shrine foundation matter, he confirmed that it was indeed severely rotted as the contractor had reported. After consultation among all parties, it was definitively decided to move only the main hall first and then move the foundation in a two-stage operation. However, since the framework around the pillars would be difficult without slightly opening the surrounding boards, after further consultation, the head carpenter was instructed to prepare new straw mats (two pieces) sandwiched with bamboo poles to line the interior of the foundation. One side of the boards behind the stairs was lifted, the straw matting was maneuvered inside, the floor boards were gradually opened little by little, the straw matting was attached to the foundation, and the interior of the foundation was concealed. Afterward, the contractor was instructed to assign the main hall framework work to the head carpenter. While the head carpenter was laying the straw matting, white curtains were hung around all four sides of the main hall, with one head carpenter performing the work. The head carpenter also reported that the foundation's tightly fitted boards appeared to be severely damaged.

1. For the straw matting to be placed under the foundation during the attachment and hauling, the contractor, following the head carpenter's instructions, prepared more than ten overlapping layers during the daytime.

The deputy messenger Miyake Nakatsukasa-roku and attendants arrived, first donning formal court dress (sokutai) at Minamoto Akira's residence. For this occasion, to notify the various officials of their participation, the great drum of the council hall was struck, and each proceeded to the shrine precincts. However, while during the Kanpō era they assembled at the pilgrimage lodge, this time since the pilgrimage lodge had become the construction office, they assembled at the shrine precincts. Due to construction at the guard post and feast hall, they assembled at the western offering hall. Consequently, when the head priest participated, the shrine servants did not need to proceed ahead.

1. After everyone had assembled, the administrator sent word through subordinates to the imperial messenger's resting place that they should proceed when convenient, and subsequently for their participation, the head priest and others took their seats in the front courtyard of the new shrine, with shrine officials in a single row facing west in northern order, and voluntary participants seated behind the shrine officials. However, during the Kanpō era they sat in a single row under the north eaves of the Chinese gate, facing east in northern order, but this time because scaffolding for construction of the Chinese gate, celebrant quarters, and imperial offering buildings was obstructive, they were moved to the eastern side toward Fujino Shrine. The circular cushions were arranged by junior officials under orders from the chief magistrates.

1. The procedure for the imperial messenger's visit: proceeding via Sakedono Bridge to enter the first torii. At that time, the yin-yang diviner came out to meet them and performed purification of the body. The yin-yang diviner entered through the tower gate to the middle gate, where the Kibune shrine attendant performed body purification before the young shrine. Next, the messenger crossed from the second torii via the shrine attendant bridge and corridor bridge, entering to stand in formation under the eaves of the new shrine gate. The document box was carried by the deputy messenger. Next, the Kibune shrine attendant advanced with lowered hem from within the Chinese gate to appear before the messenger. The messenger took the document box and handed it to the shrine attendant, who took it and passed it to the administrator. The messenger bowed once, and the shrine attendant returned the bow. The shrine attendant proceeded to the front of the new shrine's temporary hall (where a kneeling mat had been prepared beforehand), took the imperial edict from the administrator's document box, finished viewing it, placed it on the great platform altar, performed double prostrations, recited prayers, and clapped hands. The administrator returned the document box to the messenger's side, holding our document box while waiting near the temporary hall. The shrine attendant removed the imperial edict, placed it in the administrator's document box, and the administrator withdrew within the Chinese gate. The shrine attendant advanced before the messenger and bowed once, the messenger returned the bow, and the shrine attendant withdrew within the Chinese gate. The head priest and others advanced before the messenger and bowed once, the messenger returned the bow, and when finished, the messenger withdrew. There was a banquet ceremony at the office building, but as it was the same as the wood construction beginning ceremony on January 27th, this is omitted. The administrator's greetings were as before. Regarding the sword catalog, attendants wearing plain jackets conducted it, same as before. Next, the evening offerings were prepared and presented as usual, with the duty shrine official Nara Celebrant Kenakira participating in service. Moreover, the morning offerings

1. Tonight is the temporary relocation ceremony for Tanao Shrine, Sugio Shrine, Hajio Shrine, Suwa Shrine, Hashimoto Shrine, and others. The time is during the hours of Tori, Inu, I, and Ne (approximately 5 PM to 1 AM). Starting after the hour of Uma, chief administrators Morimori and Ujun supervised the ceremony, with Hoken, two tōne officials, two laborers (hakuchō), and shrine attendants appearing at the front of the shrine grounds for preparations before the deities.

1. For the temporary relocation of the subsidiary shrines, daily offerings are presented to the main shrine's subsidiary shrines as usual. The duty priest, chief shrine priest Naruhisa, serves in this capacity, while the subsidiary shrines are served by the appointed clan members. Particularly for the five subsidiary shrines undergoing relocation today, only morning offerings are presented, offered by deputy shrine administrator Kiyu (in court dress) around the hour of Uma.

1. After the hour of Tori, head priest Hirohisa (wearing sokutai court dress, accompanied by one person in court dress, one hakuchō, shrine attendants with torches, and tōne carrying ritual offerings leading the way), chief administrator Ken'an, administrator Yoshiyasu (deputy Hirohaku), deputy administrator Taruaki (deputy Kenken), and others each wearing purified robes and accompanying garments followed in attendance. The ritual attendants Bunko and Seiman (in purified robes and accompanying garments) served from the retreat quarters, along with Yin-Yang Master Iken (in court dress), chief carpenter Saemon (in formal wear), and other voluntary participants including chief shrine priest Naruhisa, assistant chief priest Yasuhisa, Shingu shrine priest Tsunekiyo (deputy Bunsei) and shrine celebrant Hosū, Nara shrine priest Sueta (deputy Kisai) and shrine celebrant Kenken, Sawada shrine priest Ujio, shrine celebrant Kanetame (in hunting robes and purified garments as desired), and Kaneshige.

　First, the temporary relocation of Tanao Shrine:
　　The ceremony involved laying mat pathways from the main hall to the temporary hall, spreading white cloth, and setting up double-layered white curtains on all four sides with a single outer curtain. The supervising administrators had arranged this in advance, and the head priest and ritual attendants took their positions in front of the deities (between the inner and outer curtains).
　Next, the chief carpenter (in purified robes) advanced and removed the sacred rope from in front of the sacred doors. Before this, the pine ceremony officiant lit the courtyard fires within the curtained area.
　Next, Yin-Yang Master Iken (in court dress) entered within the curtains and performed purification rituals for the temporary hall, sacred treasures, head priest, ritual attendants, and others.

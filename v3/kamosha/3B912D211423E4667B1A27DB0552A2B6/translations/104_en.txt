After that, they withdraw. Next, the head negi proceeds to the front of the Chinese gate (previously waiting within the tower gate). Carrying the sacred offerings, he proceeds from the Chinese gate to before the deities, ascends the stairs (without bowing), presents them on the sacred offering table with one bow, descends the stairs with one bow, and at the corridor receives the aoi (hollyhock) and katsura (Japanese Judas tree) from the deputy and holds them attached to his ritual tablet (previously, the deputy master had inserted the aoi and katsura into aoi skewers, carried them, and delivered them to the Wakamiya negi seat). He exits from the Chinese gate, passes through the tower middle gate, crosses the jewel bridge, places the aoi and katsura (still on skewers) on the case in the north courtyard of the bridge hall as before, crosses the jewel bridge and enters the tower gate (rest). At this time, the chief priest (after seeing the head negi place the sacred offerings on the sacred table, perform one bow, descend the stairs, perform one bow and withdraw) rises, performs two bows, recites the norito prayer, completes two claps and two bows, then rises from his seat (seat bow). He proceeds to the bottom of the stairs for one bow, ascends to the great platform for one bow, removes the imperial proclamation (holding it attached to his ritual tablet), performs one bow, descends the stairs (without bowing), and exits from the Chinese gate (at this time, the proclamation is stored in a box and carried by a court attendant, but the short documents are prepared in advance from the lodging). Passing through the tower middle gate, jewel bridge, etc., at Suwa Shrine below, within the sacred rope on the stone, facing the bridge hall, he kneels and recites the return prayer (the procedure is oral tradition). Upon completion with hand claps, the imperial messenger responds. Next, the chief priest takes the aoi and katsura from the case (holding them on skewers attached to his ritual tablet), proceeds to the bridge hall and ascends (without shoe bow but from the east), and presents the aoi and katsura to the imperial messenger (in the same manner as receiving the proclamation, advancing and retreating on knees). The imperial messenger inserts them in his court cap (however, he purifies and takes the aoi and katsura twice). Next, the chief priest holds the empty skewer and withdraws (with shoe bow as before), crosses the jewel bridge, enters the tower gate, ascends to the offering hall, performs two bows at the center, recites prayers (for the inner palace sacred offerings), performs two claps and two bows, then withdraws.

Next, the imperial messenger leaves his seat (seat bow), descends the stairs (shoe bow, south stairs), and temporarily takes position at the earth house (under the west eaves). Next, the horse stable officials lead the sacred running horses around the bridge hall (three circuits). After completion, they lead them across the jewel bridge, perform one bow in front of the tower gate, and withdraw via the camphor bridge.

Next, the shrine deputies (two people wearing hunting robes) lead the warrior-decorated horses around the bridge hall (three circuits). After completion, they cross the jewel bridge toward the deity presence (in front of the tower gate), perform one bow, and withdraw from the camphor bridge. Next, the attendants begin singing, and flute dancers advance (between the earth house and細殿). The dances performed are the first section of Azuma Asobi, Suruga dance, and Tsugiko. After completion, the singer-dancers withdraw (next, two horse riders advance toward the horses, perform the ritual request for running horses, then complete the horse-riding prayers, ride out through the second torii to run, and stop within the first torii. After both horses finish running within the reed door area, the imperial messenger withdraws, and beside the reed door, the two riders and imperial messenger perform a courtesy ceremony, whereupon the imperial horses are returned to the horse stable). Next, the imperial messenger, inner treasury messenger and others, all those who participated in the shrine visit, each withdraw. Next comes the running horses (main shrine running horses) (however, there are twelve Kamo running horses; during other shrine festivals, the director master recites prayers at the platform; regarding other matters such as the riders' mounting procedures, further inquiry is needed). Next, at the bridge hall seat, the chief priest and hafuri perform the celebratory words ceremony at the bridge hall.

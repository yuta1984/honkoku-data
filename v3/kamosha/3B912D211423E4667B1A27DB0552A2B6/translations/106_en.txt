They stand in formation at the bottom of the stairs, perform one bow, and divide left and right to wait above and below the stairs (however, the Shingu hafuri and below wait in a single line at the negi quarters). Next, the sacred curtains are rolled up. Next, the tenkū rises from his seat, takes the round trays (three or four pieces suffice), passes them to the Wakamiya hafuri, and then each proceeds in turn. Next, the sacred offerings are removed.

The ceremony proceeds as follows: first the hafuri side's wrapped offerings, then the stacked offerings, then the sacred raw offerings (five throats), then the sacred birds, then the sacred carp, then the boat rice cakes (two vessels), then the boat rice (two vessels), then from the negi side: salted sweetfish, then cypress bark rice dumplings, then the wrapped offerings, then garlic, then stacked offerings, then sacred raw offerings (five throats), then sacred birds, then sacred carp, then boat rice cakes (two vessels), then boat rice (two vessels), then the sacred cup, then the sacred chopsticks, then the koma offerings (hafuri side), then the same (negi side).

After removing everything completely, the sacred wiping cloths (four sheets of half-paper placed on round trays) are brought forward. The chief priest and hafuri take these and remove the round trays (the Shingu hafuri takes them and places them between the railings). Next, the sacred curtains are lowered.

Next, the Wakamiya hafuri rises from his seat, advances to the bottom of the stairs, performs one bow, and waits in the hafuri quarters corridor (but facing diagonally toward the deity). Next, after the Wakamiya negi and above stand in formation and perform one bow, they all wait at the hafuri quarters (same as the Wakamiya hafuri). Next, the chief priest exits the inner sanctuary, performs one bow, descends the stairs, performs one bow, and waits at the hafuri quarters (below the eastern worship pillar, on the sunhenri board).

Next, the hafuri exits the inner sanctuary, performs one bow, and closes the sacred doors (each prostrating). The sacred chains are joined. Next, the deputy (advancing from the negi quarters) presents the sacred chain wrapper to the hafuri.

(Ascending the stairs) The hafuri takes it (at this time the sacred key is passed to the deputy dayu). After wrapping the sacred chain, he performs one bow, descends the stairs, and performs one bow. Next, they retire in order starting from the lowest rank (descending from Wakamiya worship hall, then offering the evening sacred offerings at the outer sanctuary. The duty shrine official performs this). From below the middle gate, they proceed across the jewel bridge and via the bamboo bridge (however, in this ceremony, after descending from Wakamiya worship hall and making pilgrimage visits to Wakamiya, Shingu and other small shrines, Kataoka shrine, etc., they pass via the bamboo bridge and take seats in the bridge hall). They ascend to the bridge hall from the south stairs (each with shoes and ceremonial bowing) and take their seats (the seating arrangement is as on the night of purification).

Next, the horsemen and attendants descend from the sacred birth place, come to the bridge hall, announce their return, and withdraw.

Next, each shrine official rises from his seat (in this ceremony, after the shrine officials arrive at the bridge hall, only about two horsemen ascend to the bridge hall, perform one ceremonial bow toward the shrine officials, at which time the shrine officials return the bow, and then the attendants descend the stairs and withdraw). They descend the stairs and make pilgrimage visits to North Iwamoto, Sawada, Nara shrines, etc., then take seats in the office building (the manner is as usual). Next comes the sacred offering feast. At this time, the bettō and shoshi inquire about the fixed festival planting day, and the chief priest announces the time limit (but is this after group deliberation?). After the matter is concluded, each withdraws.

(Regarding the feast items: the sacred chest offerings are divided in half, and for the chief hafuri and below, the toneri serves them at their seats. The details are found in the bettō's annual ceremonies. The subsidiary shrine outer sanctuary offerings and the sacred offerings in the courtyard are transported by shrine servants to their respective shrine official residences, and moreover the toneri accompanies them to their village residences to divide them in half, but these are not served at the seats.

At the seats: the main shrine outer sanctuary morning and evening portions and the main shrine boat rice are placed on trays with chopsticks added and served left and right, flower flat rice cakes are served in earthenware vessels, along with sixty-three serving items, inner sanctuary sacred sweets are served in flat dishes and passed left and right. Also, the boat rice of the seven shrines is divided in half and prepared on food mats, then sitting in order, then fixing the festival planting date and time. After completion, the toneri serves the items and each person withdraws.)

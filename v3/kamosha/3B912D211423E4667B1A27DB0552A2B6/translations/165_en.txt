The sanctuary is closed and the sacred doors are shut. Everyone prostrates. Next, the chief administrator advances the sacred lock wrapping (as usual; in this sequence, the sacred key is passed to the chief administrator). After the chief hafuri fastens and wraps the sacred locks, following one bow above and below the stairs, each shrine official from the hafuri side (lower ranks stand as usual) along with rotating offerers, purification attendants, musicians, etc., withdraw. At this time, the shrine officials exit through the tower middle gate, cross the jewel bridge (now they mostly go via the connecting hall), make pilgrimage to Iwamoto, Sawada, Nara shrines, etc., and take their seats in the office building (the seating arrangement and left-right distinctions are as usual).

Next, evening offerings for the outer sanctuaries of both halls are presented. The procedure is first the main hall, then the assistant hall. The duty shrine official (remaining at the shrine precincts, after receiving guidance from the meal department, advances to the main shrine) prepares these (advance and retreat as usual). Rotating offerers and below are as usual (particularly, after preparing both halls, they take the prayer seats, recite prayers once, then first remove the assistant hall sacred offerings, then the main hall; during the preparation and removal, sacred paper candles are advanced). When completed, shrine officials take their seats in the office building.

Next is the sacred meal sharing for shrine officials and clan members. The items are: two sets of chopsticks (as at every sacred ritual), two cups of sacred rice (morning offerings from both halls' outer sanctuaries served in earthenware; however, the three offices use moon-shaped vessels as usual), two cups of sacred vegetables (two pieces of ray fish placed in mesh-patterned earthenware), one cup of boat rice (cut in half and served in earthenware; however, the three offices use one boat of rice. The above is the inner sanctuary portion. However, at the main shrine alone, due to insufficiency, all remaining portions from subsidiary shrines are received by officials, half is distributed, and the remainder becomes officials' sacred meal), three items (same as the Harvest Festival) are loaded and prepared on food tables. Each takes their assigned seat and the inner sanctuary sacred offerings are distributed (attendants put them in sacred containers and distribute them. The items are: carp (one throat), bird (one), sea bream (two pieces), ray fish (sixteen pieces), dried squid (two pieces), flower rice cakes (sixteen pieces), etc. The head priest's sacred meal is brought to that pavilion by sacred attendants as usual. First the chief hafuri, with items the same as the head priest, but from the chief hafuri down, they are distributed at the seats).

Next, from the chief negi to the Kataoka negi: sea bream (four pieces), dried squid (two pieces), ray fish (sixteen pieces), rice cakes (sixteen pieces) are provided. From the Kataoka negi to the clan deity hafuri, each shrine's sacred offerings are divided in two for sacred meals as usual. However, boat rice is passed from the administrator to officials, whereby officials divide it in two and distribute it at the seats. For boat rice cakes, twenty pieces per subsidiary shrine are prepared and advanced, with sixteen pieces placed in sacred containers for distribution, and the remaining four pieces become the administrator's sacred meal.

One boat rice cake is provided (is this the inner sanctuary portion? Served in earthenware; those making voluntary pilgrimages are given one piece each). Next, two cups of sacred rice (evening offerings from both halls, same as morning offerings). Next, two cups of sacred vegetables (evening offerings, same as morning offerings). Next, sacred chopsticks are announced (as usual). Next, sacred confections (combining left and right portions from both halls, served on wooden plates loaded on trays, distributed left and right by attendants at the administrator's direction). Next, boat rice (one boat, one set of sacred chopsticks, etc., loaded on trays and distributed left and right by attendants; is this the assistant hall inner sanctuary portion?). Next, small implements (as usual; morning and evening portions from both halls' outer sanctuaries loaded on trays and distributed left and right). Next, sitting mats (as usual; distributed by minor deputies). Next, announcement items are distributed. Next, the head priest and below withdraw.

One item: Chief administrator, deputy, purification attendants (four pieces each; particularly for the administrator, passed by the administrator before the sacred presence; for purification attendants and deputy, minor deputies serve as intermediaries to receive them), among attendants (twenty-one pieces), two sacred attendants (one piece each), etc., ray fish sacred meals are as usual (details can be seen in the New Year's Day section below).

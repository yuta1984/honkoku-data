(When passing through the third torii, each person performs no bowing) They arrive at the Tsuchiya (seat bowing and shoe bowing as usual). The shrine officials of Chief Hafuri, Kataoka, Kibune, Shingu, Ōta and others arrive at the office building (crossing Nara Bridge, entering the daily offering torii, and arriving at the office building from the cut board area). The Chief Hafuri, as the single official, takes his seat at the main building (the others still reserve this seat, facing the cut board) (two tatami mats are spread in the convenience area). Next, the imperial messenger approaches (dismounting outside the first torii, all officials arrange themselves in formation and accompany from around the first torii area with ceremonial sounds, while the kebiishi officials stop outside the second torii). At the rest pavilion (using the music hall as the location) they wait briefly. Next, divine offerings and sacred treasures proceed from the Nie-den hall. The procedure is: first the Chief Hafuri and others rise from their seats and perform hand purification in order (the Shoshi-dayū serves this role). Next, the Bettō-dayū passes hollyhock to the Chief Hafuri (however, this hollyhock is passed when the Chief Hafuri reaches the Wakamiya worship hall and gives it to the Bettō-dayū) (Bettō-dayū takes his seat). The Chief Hafuri carries this and goes first, followed by the sacred sake vessels and other divine offerings (the items can be seen in the procession order), next the Nie-den Bettō (in jōe, tan, and sashinuki), next the Shoshi (same as above), next the court musicians (in tan'ikkan, playing music), next the sacred treasures, first the sacred spear carried and held by Kataoka Negi. Next the sacred spear (Kataoka Hafuri), next the decorated sword (Kibune Negi), next the field sword (Kibune Hafuri), next the sacred bow (Shingu Negi), next the sacred arrows (Shingu Hafuri), next the sacred bow (Ōta Negi), next the sacred arrows (Ōta Hafuri), next the sacred wagon (Mitana-dokoro Bettō in jōe tan sashinuki), next the sacred vessel Karahitsu (from the sacred spear downward all have brocade bags and protective covers), next the Mifuku-dokoro Bettō (jōe tan sashinuki), next the subsidiary shrine divine offering boxes (seven from the courtyard direction), next the same divine offering Karahitsu (from the outer sanctuary direction), next the small shrine divine offering Karahitsu, next the Kibune daily offering Karahitsu, next the main shrine daily offering Karahitsu. Taguchi accompanies them (particularly the road-leading divine attendants announce the procession, but the shrine officials carrying sacred treasures from the Chief Hafuri down lower their hems from the sakaki area, those in rain ceremonies need not perform this ritual, at the offering hall they lower their hems at the bottom of the stairs). When the divine offerings and sacred treasures pass through the Tsuchiya, everyone prostrates themselves. Next, the onmyōji advance and stand below the Tama Bridge, purify and cleanse the divine offerings, sacred treasures, and the bodies of the shrine officials, and when finished, the divine offerings are divided left and right and arrive at the imperial offering shelf. Regarding the sacred treasures, each shrine official immediately places them in the offering hall. The procedure is: first both officials stand together and ascend the stairs (however this ritual differs by year), cross the threshold (hanging the knee, but on the left), sit down in front of the mat path and proceed on knees (now there is no such ritual, as knee-walking on the mat path is burdensome and causes folding, it should be made as light as possible). They place them on the mat path (however the negi straightens them toward the right head, the hafuri need not perform this ritual. Particularly, a high table with one leg is prepared on three mats in the center of the mat path, with two mats spread on each side, and the sacred treasures are placed on top, though this differs by year). Then holding the scepter (from the waist or from within the bosom), they retreat on their knees (particularly passing the mat path, this is where they previously sat down), perform one bow and withdraw (negi turns left, hafuri turns right). They descend the stairs and put on shoes (shoe bowing, adjusting hems). Next they wait in a line facing north on the stone platform below Tanao Shrine. Next the head priest and others, next (perhaps a character is missing) they rise from Tsuchiya and approach (particularly the negi group crosses the Sunoko Bridge, Tama Bridge etc. and enters the tower gate, while the hafuri group crosses the Hafuri Bridge, crossing hall etc. and enters the Shingu gate). First performing shoe bowing, the negi group from the Chinese-style gate

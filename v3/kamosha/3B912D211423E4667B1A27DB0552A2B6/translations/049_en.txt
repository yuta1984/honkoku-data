Initial offering {{Note: however, this refers to the person serving as record keeper}}. The five villages proceed in order, passing from Okamoto Village to the deputy administrator, then transferring to the elderly person {{Note: at this time, the six people including the five village rice field supervisors, record keeper, and deputy administrator and above perform the offering ceremony with sake vessels added. The others scatter and add}}. They proceed in order and withdraw {{Note: after completing the offering ceremony, the meal trays are removed, and one citrus fruit and one piece of kelp are placed on small stands, with each person taking their place for tea service}}.

Next, three people from the treasury office withdraw to the preparation area, and one administrator comes forward to conduct the announcement ceremony.

　This ceremony involves the items entrusted to Yadō Shōshō-e and the examination of return draft papers. These return draft papers consist of one bundle of two booklets placed on wooden boards. Seven pairs of brushes and two ink sticks are also placed on wooden boards, which the administrator brings out and announces should be examined. These items are the tenth-numbered tags. The previous day, junior officials of that group brought them to Hakuken Pavilion, and today each village group examines them. When there are no particular issues, the administrator manages them in the preparation area and distributes them to people wearing purified garments - five people from the village groups and the administrators. Of course, they are placed on wooden boards: to Kawakami Village and Omiya Village, two booklets of paper and one pair of brushes each; to Koyama Village, one and a half booklets of paper and one pair of brushes; to Nakamura Village, two booklets and ten sheets of paper and one pair of brushes; to Okamoto Village, one and a half booklets of paper and one pair of brushes; to the administrators, two booklets of paper, two pairs of brushes, and two dragon-shaped ink sticks wrapped in one sheet of Mino paper,

　tied with twisted paper cord. In addition to this, half-sheet booklets of paper are distributed to the village groups as revised accounting paper materials. In total, eleven booklets and thirty-four sheets are required {{Note: however, one booklet contains forty-eight sheets}}.

Next, the people serving as record keepers for the five village rice field supervisors perform the auspicious writing ceremony.

　In this ceremony, they first cut the paper into quarters, bind one corner with a needle, and write the auspicious text. For the draft, see the appendix. Of course, inkstones and ink are prepared in advance - about two boxes at Hakuken Pavilion. After completing this writing, they add their seal to the return draft. In this ceremony as well, people wearing purified garments carry the items on wooden boards to each of the five villages in order, and the record keeper takes them and adds their seal. After completing this ceremony for all five villages in the same manner, each person keeps their copy. Apart from this, the five people not on duty and the deputy administrators have no ceremonial duties. However, the record keeper should prepare a small sword.

After the matters are concluded, celebratory words are spoken, and everyone withdraws.

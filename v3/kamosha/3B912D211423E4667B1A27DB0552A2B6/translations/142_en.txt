After wrapping the sacred lock, the shrine priest and below-ranking shrine officials《at this time, junior attendants rise from the ritualist section》, rotating offerings staff, etc. withdraw. Starting from Wakamiya Shrine《particularly first》《beginning worship from Haji-no-o Shrine》 they make pilgrimage rounds to Kataoka Shrine, and shrine officials take their places at the earthen building《their seating follows the usual manner. Particularly from Kataoka Shrine, the shrine maiden and ritualist sections face each other, crossing the left and right bamboo bridges to reach the earthen building. However, shrine officials of Ota, Nara, and Sawada clan shrines go directly to the earthen building after their shrine withdrawal. The five-official group does not take seats but remains at the shrine grounds with some delay, as can be observed》

Next, sword-bearers wait at the left and right enclosures《sitting on stools and wearing swords, the shrine maiden section faces east on the west side, the ritualist section faces west on the east side. According to the Ritsu Journal, on September 9th, Tenna 4th year, the eastern enclosure was set up facing south, but this morning it was changed to face west with left and right facing each other. Before Tenna era, it faced south. Also, these stools and swords are provided by deputy officials》Along with document holders waiting near the enclosures《both east and west. However, two deputy officials wait at a convenient location for arrangements, with document holders at the head and sword-bearers at junior positions, each determining their seating order》

Next, the sumo wrestling ceremony begins. First, the deputy shrine maiden and ritualist rise from the earthen building to perform the sumo ground preparation ritual.

The procedure: First, both deputy officials《seated bow》rise《shoe bow》and stand at the northern head of the east and west enclosures《the deputy shrine maiden goes from behind the fine hall to the west enclosure, the deputy ritualist goes through the east of the fine hall to the east enclosure. At this time, both lower their hems. This ceremony is performed below the earthen building seats》

First, the deputy shrine maiden advances to the southern courtyard《the procedure involves emerging from the northern head of the west enclosure toward the southern two torii direction, turning right, then facing north again and advancing toward the northern fine hall direction》and uses the ritual baton to draw ground markings in the courtyard sand《the procedure involves advancing about two jō from the two torii direction to the fine hall front courtyard entrance, pressing the right sleeve with the left hand and pulling the hem, using the tip of the ritual baton《right hand》to draw circular forms in two tiers. The drawing traces first mark the center of the sand, then the western half-circle, next the eastern half-circle, then continuing the drawing with the western half-circle, then the eastern half-circle. However, after each drawing, one kneels holding the baton upright and walks in procession, and when drawing, as in the beginning, presses the right sleeve and draws with the baton tip at waist level. Each circle is done this way》

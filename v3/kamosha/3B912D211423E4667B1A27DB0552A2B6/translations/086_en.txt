Do not place in the food container, but place the skate and sake cups in the sacred serving tray. According to another theory, the sake cups and skate should also be placed in the food container like those for the small shrines.

Items to be loaded on the hanging boat:
1. Main shrine food containers <<covered with lids (silk, this character may be missing)>> two sets <<stacked>> 1. Small shrine food containers <<covered with lids (silk, same as above?)>> four sets <<two sets each, stacked>>
1. Shadow offerings <<seven cups placed in pure vessels>> 1. Tin box <<two sando earthenware plates placed in tin box. Since skate for sake cup use is not placed in food containers, sake cups and skate go in sacred serving trays, so they don't go in tin boxes>>
1. Rice balls <<approximately 150>> loaded on boats

All the above divine offerings are loaded on hanging boats, first positioned at the upper seats, and when carrying them in procession, place sakaki on top of the lids <<to prevent the wind from scattering the lids during the journey>>

1. Regarding the preparation procedures for divine offerings and records, guidance should be provided to the shrine officials and御師 residences <<consultation on proper attire>>

1. When the large drum bearer <<wearing hakama>> arrives, provide sake <<serve appropriate side dishes, no need to record>> If arriving late, send someone to call them
1. After everyone assembles, inform the shrine officials and御師 that they should each inspect whether there are any discrepancies in the divine offerings
After inspecting the divine offerings, issue the records <<shrine officials wear pure white robes with pointed trousers and thick cords,御師 wear pure white robes with thick cords>>

Next, the sacred lock wrapping is given in advance to the hafuri (advancing from the negi side and ascending the stairs). The hafuri takes it (at this time, the sacred key is passed to the assistant, who takes it and withdraws). After completing the wrapping of the sacred lock, he bows once, descends the stairs and bows once. Next, he withdraws from the lower ranks to the hafuri side (descending to the Wakamiya worship hall). Next, each of the five officials makes a great circuit, enters the second torii, and visits the shrine precincts.

After the twenty-one officials and shrine affairs representatives have assembled, they proceed to the sacred purification site. First, they bow once toward the sacred enclosure and take their curtained seats (however, tonight's seating arrangement has the head priest, chief hafuri, and chief negi sitting in order). Next, hollyhock (eight pieces, thirty-two stems) and katsura (a little) are mutually inserted into the caps and headgear of the shrine officials by the administrator and director (the assistant brings them in the sacred chest).

Next, divine offerings are prepared at the sacred enclosure (the divine attendants prepare them; the items are seen in the clan deity festival). Direct meeting (conducted by the divine attendants). Next, they drink turbid sake while seated in a circle.

(Regarding the tradition that at the curtained area of the sacred purification site, the divine hall, and the tower gate seats, the chief negi sits in the seat next to the chief hafuri, in the sacred purification of the 15th day of the 4th month of Hōreki 7, because Hosho went down to the Kantō region, that night Chikeyoshi participated as a substitute and sat next to the head priest, above the chief hafuri - why was this? This was because Hosho had been shown this procedure several days in advance)

(On the clear day of the 8th day of the 4th month of Hōreki 9, when I participated as a substitute for the Shinmiya hafuri in the sacred purification, I sat in order with the chief hafuri and chief negi at the curtained seat of the sacred purification site, which already differed from the previous year. At that time, chief negi Hosho was participating. How should this procedure be? This should still be inquired about)

Next, starting from the head priest, they rise in order and perform ablutions (the director-secretary serves in this role). Next, the sacred fire is extinguished. Next, the five officials present offerings (the procedure is first to hold together both public offerings [presented by the assistant-secretary] and private offerings [brought by shrine officials] and present them as usual). Rising and going to the head priest (the director-secretary serves in this role at the shrine affairs representative's place), they perform formal double bows (some sources say while remaining seated) and upon completion, pass to the divine attendants. Next, the divine attendants

tear the offering paper, place it in the sacred chest, bring it before the five officials, and each takes about twenty pieces (actually fifteen pieces are needed, with five pieces as extra blessing). Next,

five divine attendants bring five sakaki branches (over five feet long with branches and leaves) before the five officials. At this time, the five officials tie the torn paper to the sakaki (there are deep secrets; three pieces are tied to each branch, and after completion, they are passed in order - fifteen pieces per person). Upon completion, the five divine attendants circle the sacred sand mound three times with the sakaki (circling left with each prostrating), and after finishing, the divine attendants kneel before the sacred sand mound (there are deep secrets regarding the divine procession). Next, the head priest and those below rise in order, bow once toward the sacred enclosure, and take their seats in the divine hall (prostrating, facing north and up, facing west). They await the divine procession. Next, the divine attendants (calculating the timing when shrine officials are seated and prostrating) - five people hold sakaki, and the court music officials strike the rhythm clappers (the procedure for wooden clappers is seen above; the location for striking the wooden clappers is the upper section) and reverently perform secret songs (there are secret oral records for this procedure; shrine officials perform it). The administrator, secretaries, and others follow and conduct the divine procession, crossing the camphor bridge from the back gate, entering through the Shinmiya sacred gate, and circling the worship hall (three times). Upon completion, they exit the Shinmiya sacred gate. First, two divine attendants place sakaki at the base of Tanao Shrine (this procedure is oral tradition). The latter three place sakaki at the clan deity sacred grounds (this procedure is oral tradition). Next, the shrine officials rise (calculating the timing for conducting the divine procession) and each proceeds down to the back gate. Next, the administrator announces that they should proceed forward. Next, each shrine official divides to the left and right of the sun gate, advances before the sacred presence, bows once, and takes their seats (as initially). Next, the assistant passes the sacred key to the chief hafuri, the hafuri rises, advances to the bottom of the stairs for one bow, and ascends to the great floor.

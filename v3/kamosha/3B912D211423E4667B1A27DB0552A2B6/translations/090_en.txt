They perform the purification at the main shrine. The procedure is as follows: first, the two senior members proceed to the main shrine earthen platform for one bow, then ascend to the great floor for one bow.
Next, the two junior members bow once at the earthen platform, then wait at the middle of the stairs. Then they sweep the left and right railings in front of the sacred doors, and
when finished, the junior members withdraw and wait at the waiting area. Next, the two senior members descend to the earthen platform for one bow, then proceed to the auxiliary shrine to
perform purification. The procedure is the same as before. Next, they perform purification from Sugio Shrine to Kataoka Shrine, then enter the tower gate and middle gate again and once more perform the Kaicho-ota ceremony at the feast hall. Regarding the purification ceremony for Sugio Shrine and below,
at minor shrines two people alternate in performing the duty, at branch shrines it is done as at the main shrine, and at the sacred shrines they perform purification along the route and
finish before withdrawing (however, they do not visit the clan deity shrines; for Sawada, Nara, Ota shrines etc., they sweep from outside the viewing gates. Also, the shrine deputy remains seated during the main shrine purification, and after finishing performs the purification ceremony before withdrawing, though in recent times they withdraw directly without performing it).

Next, the purification leaders (five people) perform the purification. The procedure is the same as before, but they do not climb ladders.

1. Purification - Early morning on Horse Day - Sacred lanterns - Two sheets of sugihara paper - Two sheets of hanshi paper - Items to be sent to the shrine precincts
　(Sacred birth place - After purification on Horse Day, the minor deputy provides sakaki branches used during the Five Officials' invocation ceremony. There are four branches, each over five shaku long. The day before, at the sacred birth place, the minor deputy passes them to the Yatone, who receives them and sets them up, placing them in front of the sacred enclosure)
　(The clappers for the scepter rhythm are made of oak wood, approximately one shaku and five sun long. That night, the Yatone passes them to the Deputy Administrator, song officials, etc. The Yatone provides them)
　(During the divine procession, the procedure for the Five Officials' invocation when shrine officials sit in the sacred hall states "east superior, north-facing," but it is actually "north superior, west-facing")
　(That night, after closing the middle gate, the sacred gate remains closed until that day. This is an ancient ceremonial form to prohibit all people from entering the sacred presence until the official imperial messenger's visit. Therefore, it is opened on that day)

Sequence of the Purification Sacred Ritual
Time limit (Hour of the Rooster) Announcement of sacred visit, exiting the gate three times (wearing court dress, accompanied by one person. However, the Five Officials' group each carries one private offering) Assembly

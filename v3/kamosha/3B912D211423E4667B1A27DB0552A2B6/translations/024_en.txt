After one bow, they return to their seats [Note: However, both negi and celebrant arrange their hems, and the bows and salutations are as at the beginning, thus abbreviated]. Next, the direct sharing meal of divine offerings [Note: Divided between both officials, mainly upon imperial withdrawal, generally brought from Kamo. However, when there are small shrine divine offerings, they are placed in one karakitsu chest] is completed, and they rest at the miko quarters, change clothes, and perform the preparation and advancement of small shrine divine offerings and sacred strip offerings. First, the Gonden [Note: Divine offerings are placed in one ritual chest and offered on the sacred table. After completion, one sacred strip per shrine, with both officials alternately serving each shrine], next Kawao Shrine [Note: Divine offerings and one sacred strip offering], next Suzuka Shrine [Note: Kawao Shrine offerings are made on the great platform, no sacred strips], next Kuroo Sōsha [Note: Two sacred strips offered at one location, no divine offerings], next Ushi-ichi Shrine, next Musubi-gami [Note: Divine offerings, however according to Kiyoshige-okina's transmitted scroll volume 9, offered to the private shrine. This private shrine depends on family circumstances].

[Note: There are differences with oral transmission. However, when deputy officials are in attendance, should Musubi-gami be added? Sacred strips for the inner shrine are offered at the beginning of shrine visitation. During the second time, the private shrine is offered. This concludes it]. Next Shishi Shrine [Note: Inner divine offerings and one sacred strip], next Hayashida [Note: Divine offerings], next Hiyoshi Shrine [Note: Divine offerings], next Suikuzu Shrine [Note: Divine offerings], next Inner Main Shrine [Note: Divine offerings and one sacred strip], next Suzu-ichi Shrine [Note: Divine offerings], next Private Shrine [Note: Sacred strips], and after completion they withdraw.

The locations for the above small shrine divine offerings are Kajitori, Umemiya, Shiraishi, Shirahige, Gonden, Kawao, Suzuka, Ushi-ichi, Musubi-gami, Shishi, Hayashida, Hiyoshi, Suikuzu, Inner Main Shrine, Suzu-ichi, etc., totaling fifteen shrines. The sacred strip offering locations are Main Shrine, Gonden, Kawao, Kuroo Sōsha, Ushi-ichi, Shishi, Inner Shrine, Private Shrine [Note: However, when deputy officials are in attendance, should Musubi-gami be added?], etc., totaling nine shrines. However, for the bi-seasonal renewal festival sacred strip offerings, one shrine priest serves the sacred strip offerings from the main shrine to the small shrines. This is the precedent.

Next, the Senior Negi and Assistant Negi perform one bow at the bottom of the stairs [Note: The ritual is as before], then wait on the left and right of the great platform. Next, the Assistant Celebrant and Kataoka Negi wait at the second level of the stairs [Note: The manner is as before]. Next, the Kataoka Celebrant and Shingū Negi wait at the fifth level of the stairs [Note: The manner is as at the beginning]. Next, the Shingū Celebrant and Wakamiya Negi advance to the bottom of the stairs, after one bow, they wait at the side of the western stairs [Note: In one line]. Next, the Wakamiya Celebrant advances to the bottom of the stairs, after one bow, waits at the negi's side [Note: Particularly below the sunhenri board. The negi is above]. Next, the offering transferrers rise and advance to the transparent corridor [Note: The ritual is as at the beginning]. Next, the sacred curtain is rolled up. At this time, the Shingū Celebrant waits below the sacred worship pillar. Next, the musicians play music. Next, the inner sanctuary divine offerings are removed.

The ritual first involves the offering transferrers rising, passing through the center of the Gonden, respectfully bending and advancing to the transparent corridor. After one bow, they first place three or five round trays at the designated location and transfer them. The Wakamiya Celebrant then sequentially transfers the offerings until reaching the main area.

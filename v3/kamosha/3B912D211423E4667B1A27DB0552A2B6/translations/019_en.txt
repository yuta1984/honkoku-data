[Note: The implement is received on the toshi-ita board, and those performing the food transfer pass it to the gon-negi from below the sun-hen toshi-ita board. The same applies hereafter. For each daily offering, one person from those on duty coordinates to perform the ritual above the sun-hen toshi-ita board. This is called the "upper role." The senior among those on duty performs the upper role ritual.]

[The items] proceed to the gon-negi [Note: In this ritual, the gon-shu holds the sacred eight-legged table, ascends the stairs, and passes it over. The same applies hereafter]. The gon-negi takes it and places it directly on the sacred offering table [Note: First for the negi side, then for the shu side]. Next:

Sacred rice [Note: Served in a sacred bowl with paper decoration], one set of sacred chopsticks [Note: One shaku and two sun long with a stand, made of earthenware. The sacred chopsticks for the outer sanctuary throughout the year are [prepared by] six people among the retainers: Koyama, village magistrate, workshop head, administrator, sacred garment office, shelf office, river administrator, and shoshi-taifu and above]

[Note: Six people prepare and present these. One person is allocated twenty-five days' worth and delivers them to the shoshi-taifu. Therefore, for each divine service, four sets of sacred chopsticks and forty sets of banquet chopsticks are collected by the shrine attendants of the shoshi-taifu's residence and brought to the offering hall. However, the forty banquet chopstick sets, each one shaku long, are delivered in bundles of twenty sets each. Among these, some are used for the outer sanctuary chopsticks of subsidiary shrines. The inner sanctuary chopsticks, small shrine chopsticks, and banquet chopsticks for the office building shrine officials and below are separately provided by the shoshi-taifu]

Salt [Note: A small amount served in earthenware], sake [Note: A small amount served in cloth-textured vessels], three-cut items in four bowls [Note: Also called ground-divided ray fish. Small three-cut portions served in cloth-textured vessels]

These five items are placed on round trays and transferred [Note: The kitchen staff prepares and brings these out from the western offering preparation area]. The gon-negi offers them on the sacred eight-legged table [Note: First for the negi side].

Next, following the same procedure, they are offered to the shu side. Next, high-piled offerings [Note: Small pieces of ray fish are cut. However, there is no fixed number. Each is served in earthenware with vine decorations. However, for the outer sanctuary morning offerings, a small amount of shaved bonito is added on top of the left and right high-piled offerings in two bowls. This is called the abbreviated bird ritual. For evening offerings, it is one bowl]

[Note: For regular daily offerings, one bowl of the first left and right high-piled offerings is served with one piece skin-side up. This is also the abbreviated bird ritual. Moreover, during divine services, lake-boiled shaved bonito is added a little. Therefore, ray fish is not included. However, during festivals, ray fish is used as usual. Especially on New Year's Day, one piece of pheasant is used in the sacred soup. The above is when preparing the teeth-strengthening divine offering, one piece is set aside. Also, from New Year's Day to the third day, during these three days, for sacred namasu and sacred sashimi, Adogawa and others use salted sea bream, and for sacred grilled items, small salted sea bream. Until the sixteenth day, there are sacred shaped rice cakes [Note: Flower rice cakes] and dumplings, etc. Also, from New Year's Day to the fifteenth day, bowstring leaves are used for the paper decorations of Adogawa's high-piled offerings]

[Note: The three-day portions are prepared and presented by Ohara attendants, and the rest by the imperial food office. Even until the sixteenth day, bowstring leaves are used when there are celebratory occasions. However, as standard procedure, throughout the year, loquat leaves are used, prepared and presented by the imperial food office. Also, among the eight high-piled offering bowls, Adogawa high-piled offerings regularly use mackerel as a substitute for carp, and during festivals, carp and pheasant, etc., are used. Regularly ray fish is used as a substitute for pheasant, though in recent years, about two pieces of pheasant are served during the three days of New Year]

[These are] placed on round trays, transferred, and the gon-negi offers them to the negi side. Next, twisted rice cakes [Note: A small amount served in earthenware].

Three bowls of dumplings [Note: Three pieces served in earthenware bowls, though one bowl from New Year's Day to the sixteenth day consists of shaped rice cakes], sacred sake [Note: Served in cloth-textured earthenware with stands, first offering], etc., on round trays [Note: Offered to the negi side]. Sacred soup [Note: About three pieces of daikon radish served in earthenware].

Tide-boiled dish [Note: One bowl with shaved bonito added, regularly with one small piece of ray fish added, served in cloth-textured earthenware], cold soup [Note: One bowl with a little sake served in cloth-textured vessels], vinegar [Note: One bowl, a small amount served in round earthenware], sashimi [Note: One bowl with eleven pieces of salted sea bream served in earthenware]

[Note: Salted mackerel is regularly used. However, only during festivals and the three days of New Year is salted sea bream used], flat-cut [Note: One bowl with three pieces of finely cut ray fish in earthenware], flat items [Note: One bowl, same as flat-cut], namasu [Note: One bowl with eleven pieces of salted sea bream served in earthenware; salted mackerel is regularly used]

[Note: However, during festivals and the three days of New Year, salted sea bream is used], wood-cut [Note: One bowl with four pieces of ray fish about two sun long served in earthenware], torn items [Note: One bowl with about seven small pieces of ray fish served in earthenware], grilled items [Note: One bowl with one small salted sea bream served in earthenware, though only during the three days of New Year, salted mackerel is regularly used]

These items are placed on round trays and presented [Note: The gon-negi offers them to the negi side]. Eight bowls of high-piled offerings [Note: As seen previously, offered to the shu side], twisted rice cakes [Note: One bowl, same as before], dumplings [Note: Three bowls], sacred sake [Note: Two bowls, same as before; one bowl is offered to the negi side as the second offering, the rest to the shu side], sacred soup [Note: One bowl, same as before], tide-boiled dish [Note: One bowl, same as before], cold soup [Note: One bowl, same as before], vinegar [Note: One bowl, same as before].

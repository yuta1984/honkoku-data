After the twenty-one officials assembled at the attendants' quarters, the Deputy Administrator asks "Should the sacred broom be prepared?" (The head priest responds). Next, from the head priest down to the Sawada priest (the two clan deity officials remain behind), they rise in order of bowing protocol and bow once at Nara Shrine, passing through the Daily Offering Torii and the Second Torii (bowing once at each). They arrive at the earthen quarters (each performs shoe bowing, seated bowing, etc. as usual). Next, the sacred vestments are brought from the attendants' quarters (the purification of the sacred vestments is performed by the Yin-Yang Master who comes to the Wakamiya worship hall. At that time, the vestment keeper opens the lid and the Yin-Yang Master purifies them) and placed in a white wooden sacred bitter chest (carried by two shrine attendants, one carrying a torch). The two clan deity officials and the vestment keeper proceed together (announcing "sacred procession ahead" on the route). They enter through the Second Torii, pass through the crossing hall, enter through the Shinmiya gate, enter the Chinese gate, and place the sacred bitter chest at the Wakamiya worship hall. The two clan deity officials withdraw (after the sacred vestments arrive at the Wakamiya worship hall, the clan deity officials follow their route: the negi crosses the reed bridge, the hafuri crosses the priest bridge to reach the earthen quarters. At that time, the head priest and others arrive at the bridge hall). Only the vestment keeper (wearing purification robes and hakama) goes first to the sake hall before the shrine officials' visit, accompanied by only two shrine attendants, visits the shrine precincts, transports items from the feast hall to the attendants' quarters and places them in the upper room. They arrive at the earthen quarters. Next, the sacred broom departs from the offering hall (when passing through the earthen quarters, everyone prostrates themselves). The Yin-Yang Master stands under the jewel bridge and performs purification (however, regarding the sacred broom, there was a dispatch before the sacred vestments departure, but the procedure was not fixed at that time). Next, the head priest and others rise and take seats at the bridge hall (the shrine deputy comes from the shrine precincts and similarly takes a seat at the bridge hall). The procedure involves each performing shoe bowing, ascending the south stairs, with negi taking the west seats facing east in north-superior order, and hafuri taking the east seats facing west in north-superior order in a single row. Next, the Yin-Yang ascends the north stairs and passes left and right with purification

implements (these items include untying rope, human figures, and scattered rice, each placed in triple earthenware vessels, with portions placed in viewing boxes) (the untying rope is twisted from plant fiber, the human figures are made from paper. These are provided by the Yin-Yang practitioners) and takes a seat in the center (facing south. During this time, the Yin-Yang performs the Nakatomi purification once). In Hōreki 8, when the 45-year-old Yin-Yang practitioner Juhō participated, he did not perform the Nakatomi purification ceremony, and after passing the purification implements left and right, immediately withdrew (perhaps because this person was young? This should be investigated further). First, the head priest takes the untying rope (with left hand) and unties it with his mouth, then takes the human figures (with left hand), grasps them together, breathes into them and discards them, then places his hands in the sacred taboo river (discarding without second thought). Next, he takes the scattered rice (with right hand) (there are triple earthenware vessels) and strikes three times (purification), claps hands (softly), and after finishing passes them in order (the rest is the same). When all is completed, they withdraw the folding items (the tone withdraws them). Next, the Yin-Yang takes round hemp and gives it to the head priest and chief priest, then withdraws. The head priest and priest take it and purify their bodies, passing it in order until finished (then hand it to the tone). Starting with the head priest, they rise in order, descend the north stairs, divide left and right to proceed before the deity for one bow and take their seats (in the usual manner). At that time, the deputy master advances to stand in the small courtyard holding a torch. Next, the sacred key is given in advance to the chief priest. The priest rises (without seated bow), advances to the bottom of the stairs for one bow, ascends to the great floor for one bow, and opens the sacred doors (everyone moves from their seats and prostrates). Next, the head priest rises and advances to the bottom of the stairs, the priest descends the stairs to stand alongside, they bow together upper and lower, and enter the sacred inner sanctuary. Next, the chief negi, deputy negi, and others rise and advance to the bottom of the stairs for one bow, ascend to the great floor for one bow, and divide left and right to wait.

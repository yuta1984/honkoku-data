Procedures for the Night Sacred Cleaning

When the announcement for sacred participation (after the hour of the Rooster) reaches the third time, the twenty-one shrine officials and deputy shrine administrators (wearing court dress, one person) gather at the shrine grounds.
(The route is the same as during the rabbit staff ceremony) In addition to these, the deputy of yin-yang divination, the administrator, the superintendent, the director, purification leaders and others assemble first as usual. After everyone has gathered completely, the director inquires about the attendance of the shrine officials. Next, the shrine officials perform ritual hand washing (located at the north entrance of the communion hall), and the negi and hafuri sides separate and take their seats at the transparent corridor, connecting hall, etc. (as usual). Next, the director (entering through the negi side's Chinese-style door) kneels within the threshold and asks the negi side's assembled officials "Shall we set up the sacred brooms?" The head priest answers "You should also inquire of the hafuri side" (the head priest responds). Next, the hafuri side does the same (the chief hafuri responds). After this is completed, they proceed to the offering hall and announce "We shall set up the sacred brooms." During this time, the superintendent approaches the east and west corridors (first the negi side, then the hafuri side) and announces the date of the special festival (the head priest and hafuri respond) (the purification leaders had already informed the superintendent the previous day about when the special festival would be held).

Next, the sacred brooms are dispatched from the offering hall. First, the sacred attendants lead the way, then the sword-bearer carries eleven sacred chests (three of which contain sacred brooms covered with silk, while the remaining eight are empty sacred chests. These are called "construction sacred chests" and are used to carry sacred brooms to the seven shrines, small shrines, and temples). The yin-yang master performs purification at the designated place. Next, the sacred brooms are placed on the east and west sacred offering shelves. After the yin-yang master finishes purifying the sacred brooms, he proceeds directly to the negi side (entering through the Chinese-style door).

He purifies the bodies of the shrine officials (at this time, the shrine officials put down their scepters). Next, the hafuri side does the same (after the hafuri side is completed, the yin-yang master enters the communion hall). Next, the administrator hands over the sacred keys to the chief hafuri. During this time, the deputy master advances to the small courtyard and holds a torch. Next, the hafuri ascends and opens the sacred doors, everyone moves from their positions and prostrates themselves. Next, the head priest and hafuri enter the inner sanctuary. Next, from the chief negi to the deputy shrine administrators, they divide left and right and wait on the upper and lower steps (each performs bows and salutations as usual). Next, the chief hafuri rolls up the sacred curtains. Next, the negi side advances the sacred brooms (two straw brooms and all cleaning cloths are placed on small round mats, set on round trays. The superintendent hands these to the deputy shrine administrators, who then pass them along in order. The round trays do not enter the inner sanctuary; after the head priest takes the sacred brooms, they are removed, and the Shingu negi receives them and places them between the high railings). Next, the hafuri side does the same (the director hands them to the clan deity hafuri, who then passes them along in order, the same as the negi side. Both left and right sides have sacred attendants announce precedence. These sacred brooms are prepared for the main shrine and the seven shrines below as well as small shrines, while all cleaning cloths are prepared and stored at the administrator's residence). The head priest and hafuri take these, first place them in the designated area, then load the left and right sacred objects that have been stored since the fourth month onto offering stands and bring them out to the outer sanctuary (first the negi side, then the hafuri side).

They transfer them in order (passing them along in sequence to avoid confusion between left and right, removing them at the negi side, and the director and superintendent cleanse them with water from the sacred Mono-imi River in front of the offering shelves. The procedure is the same as in the fourth month. Since cleaning cloths and two sheets of half-paper are provided by the administrator, using paper)

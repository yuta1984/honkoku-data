<<On top of the sacred rice, this is mixed in, and four elevated offerings (takamori) are placed at its four corners. When the arrow-sword prayer master (yatone) requests that the elevated offerings should be sent from the offering hall (niededono), six elevated offerings are kept from the daily offerings and chief priest's ceremonial feast on the current day and given to the arrow-sword prayer master, while the remaining two are used for the imperial offering ceremonial feast>>
<<If so, since these elevated offerings are the main shrine's sacred withdrawal, offering them together with the sacred offerings may be incorrect. This should be further considered>>

First, before the appointed time <<around half of the cock hour>>, the large drum is beaten to urge haste, and when the appointed time arrives <<around the dog hour, but traditionally at the first point of the monkey hour>>, each dancer <<wearing purified robes and standing court caps>> gathers at the chief priest's residence and takes their seats in rows at the guest mat <<however, each dancer is required to bring private offerings>>. Also, ten horses including sacred horses are led to the chief priest's residence <<the ten horses consist of: two for the chief priest, one for the prayer master, one for the ritualist, one for the assistant prayer master, one for the assistant ritualist, and four for both officials of Kataoka and Kifune. Previously, saddles are placed at these shrine officials' residences. These ten horses, when participating in the two clan deity festivals and the Kifune renewal festival, are exempted from other annual corvée duties throughout the year. Particularly, Gorōtarō is appointed on the preceding day>>

After each of these dancers has gathered, the character "奉" (respectfully) is added to the circular document. At this time, the chief priest takes his seat <<wearing hunting robes. In this ceremony, first the administrator-steward holds hemp and purifies the dancers' bodies, and also purifies all the sacred horses. The pair of round hemp comes from the yin-yang administrator's residence on the current day. Next, wigs are brought out and hung on the dancers. Next, the circular document is brought out and the character "奉" is added in order from the upper seats. These wig holders are prepared and placed at the chief priest's residence, and materials to attach to the horses' tails are also separately prepared. Each is placed on wooden boards>>

Next, four-fold streamers (shide) are attached to each horse's tail <<In this procedure, the administrator-steward hands them to the prayer attendants (tone), and the prayer attendants attach them to the sacred horses' tails. The remaining four-fold streamers are attached by the attendants>>. After completion, each dancer mounts a horse, and they proceed to the clan deity shrine with the sacred horse leading <<The procession order: sacred horse, two prayer attendants, with one carrying a torch <<this prayer attendant belongs to the clan deity shrine>>, followed by the dancers on horseback in order. However, the order is not uniform, and for each horse, those carrying the dancers' private offerings follow>>

<<However, in ancient times, the mounted dancers were led around the chief priest's courtyard three times in order before proceeding to the clan deity shrine. This ceremony no longer exists in recent times>>

At the torii gate, everyone dismounts and takes their seats <<seats are prepared in advance>> <<west and east of the worship hall, facing south on the upper side>>

Prior to this, both officials <<each wearing court dress, with one attendant each, carrying one bundle of private offerings perhaps, and torch lights>> and the administrator <<wearing purified robes and pierce-through garments>> proceed to the clan deity shrine <<Since there is no prior notice for this ceremony, attendants are sent to observe, and they proceed when five or six horses have gathered>>. First they take seats at the worship hall <<two round cushions are prepared in advance. Shrine servants perform this duty>>

Next, the prayer master presents sacred offerings, sacred sake, etc. <<In this procedure, the prayer master does not take a seat at the worship hall but proceeds directly to the earthen platform <<removing shoes as usual>>, performs one bow, ascends the stairs, and after one bow at the large platform, places the prayer master's offering table in the center. Next, sacred offerings are placed in the sacred container, and the administrator transfers the offerings. Next, sacred sake is transferred and served in small earthenware vessels, and the earthenware platform is similarly offered to the left <<west side>> of the sacred container, completing the arrangement on the offering table. The administrator returns to the worship hall seat, but the ritualist does not participate during the offering. Next, the prayer master takes his seat at the worship hall>>

Next, both officials recite ritual prayers <<as usual>>. After completion, the ritualist rises and removes the sacred offerings, sacred sake, etc., transferring them as before. After completing this removal, both officials and the administrator take seats under the canopy <<facing north with east as superior, seated on tatami with Korean borders, set up by shrine servants. The canopy is erected southwest of the worship hall. For this procedure, the palace's minor attendants transport it on the current day, and shrine servants transport it except for the two clan deity festivals>>

<<Rope comes from the construction office for each occasion, and is erected by the chief carpenter. After the ceremony concludes, it is removed the following day and usually stored under the eastern eaves of the tower gate. However, during both ceremonies, each person sits on the east side of the worship hall. Three round cushions, with both officials and administrator facing west with north as superior on a long platform, and the dancers' young attendants facing east with north as superior. However, three lower-ranking individuals sit facing north on the south side due to space constraints>>

Next, both officials present offerings <<In this procedure, first both officials rise from their seats under the canopy and take positions kneeling in the courtyard before the deity. Next, shrine servants hold the offerings <<two bundles of public and private offerings>> and present them to both officials <<In this ceremony, according to ancient practice, they were given to the administrator, who then gave them to both officials>>. At this time, both officials stand side by side and present offerings <<first bowing, then taking the offerings>> two bows, ritual prayers completed, then two bows>>. After completion, they dedicate them before the deity <<In this procedure, first the prayer master rises and proceeds before the deity, stands close to the sacred door on the prayer master's side, then waits at the earthen platform and performs two bows. Next, the ritualist rises and proceeds before the deity, stands close to the sacred door on the ritualist's side, then waits at the earthen platform and performs two bows>>. Next

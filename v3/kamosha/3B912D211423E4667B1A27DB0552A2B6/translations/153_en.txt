First, in the early morning, four clan members (wearing purification robes, these four in age order, their duties assigned by the director at least three days prior), deputy shrine administrators (purification robes, ceremonial garments), etc., proceed to the front of the shrine.
They perform the ritual of sacred cleaning. In this ceremony, four people in turn (arranged the previous day), deputy shrine administrators, etc., gather early morning at the bath house.
After assembling, they proceed like visiting the shrine, passing through the first and second torii gates, the tower gate, middle gate, etc., entering through the side door and ascending to the communion hall (the route is the same as visiting the shrine).
They take their seats (facing north with east as superior, seated according to rank). As for the deputy shrine administrator, he ascends to the transparent corridor (where shrine officials ascend and descend during daily offerings), proceeds to the main shrine earthen building and makes one bow.
He ascends to the great platform, makes one bow, and removes the left and right offering stands (first the negi side, then the hafuri side). He descends the steps, brings them to the temporary shelves at the west offering place, cleanses them with water from the sacred Mono-imi River, and places them in their original location. Next, he goes and ascends to the provisional shrine, removes the offering stands and
brings them to the temporary shelves at the west offering place. The procedure is the same as before; after cleansing, these are also placed in their original location (as before). Next, he goes to
the sacred preparation building. However, sometimes after the sacred cleaning is completed, those performing the cleaning go to the lower quarters. Next, the four people proceed
to the main shrine, take straw brooms from the base of the temporary shelves at the west offering place, with the two senior members ascending ladders, taking brooms to sweep and clear both shrine

rooftops (first the main shrine, then the provisional shrine, with one person assigned to each). Two brooms are provided (one with a white wooden handle, one without a handle, both placed on the sacred shelf. These brooms are prepared and presented by junior assistants the previous day) for performing the sacred cleaning.
The procedure is: first, the two senior members proceed to the main shrine's earthen platform for one bow, ascend to the great platform for one bow. Next, the two junior members make one bow at the earthen platform, then wait halfway up the stairs to sweep the high railings on the left and right of the sacred doors (the junior members withdraw and wait at the designated place. Next, the two senior members descend to the earthen platform for one bow).
Afterward, they proceed to the provisional shrine to perform sacred cleaning. The procedure is the same as before (from Sugio Shrine to Kataoka Shrine, again entering the tower gate, middle gate, etc., returning to the communion hall to change sedge sandals). For small shrines, two people alternate in performing the duties. From there, they perform sacred cleaning along the route in order. For subsidiary shrines, it is like the main shrine; when finished, they withdraw (however, for clan deity shrines, they do not need to visit; for Nara, Sawada, Ota, etc., they sweep only from outside the viewing area. Also, the deputy shrine administrator remains seated during the main shrine cleaning. However, senior deputies each perform their duties and withdraw). Next, the purification leaders (five people) perform the sacred cleaning.
The procedure is the same as before (they perform the sacred cleaning ritual, but do not ascend the ladders).

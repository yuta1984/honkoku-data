After performing one bow on the upper and lower steps, they wait in the celebrant's side corridor.
However, the shrine officials and negi of the daily offering rotation, after one bow, take their seats at the senior negi seat in the transparent corridor. The celebrant, after one bow, first withdraws to the eastern crossing hall, and after the other shrine officials withdraw, moves to the seat in the negi's side transparent corridor. At this time, they bow respectfully at the center. The distant shrine officials do not participate in this ritual and remain at the shrine grounds, so as usual they proceed from the direct meeting place to the transparent corridor. Also, during the rotation of the two ujigami officials, since they depend particularly on distant locations, now they often gather with the other shrine officials [Note: and so forth].

Next, the chief priest exits the inner sanctuary, and after performing one bow on the upper and lower steps, waits at the celebrant's side [Note: on the advantage board below the sacred worship pillar]. Next, the celebrant exits the inner sanctuary, performs one bow, and closes the sacred doors [Note: Previously, the chief priest and below, with the same demeanor as initially, fully store the three cuts]. At this time, the shrine administrators and below move from their seats and prostrate themselves. After the celebrant finishes closing the sacred doors, the sacred lock is fitted and the cover added. At this time, the deputy senior official advances the sacred lock wrapper to the celebrant.

The ritual proceeds from the western offering place through the temporary hall to the main shrine at the center, ascending the steps and passing to the celebrant. The celebrant at this point passes the sacred key to the deputy senior official [Reading note: perhaps multiple characters]. Taking it, the route of withdrawal is as initially. Particularly, there are no advancing, retreating, bowing, or saluting gestures. This is because they are carrying objects.
However, the sacred lock wrapper is made from one sheet of thick paper cut into three pieces, fastened with a white wooden skewer. This skewer is always kept at the deputy's pavilion.

The celebrant wraps the sacred lock [Note: at this point passes the sacred key to the deputy senior official]. After completing this, performs one bow at the bottom of the steps, and after this bow, from the chief priest to the taboo children, each withdraws [Note: from the celebrant's side]. They make pilgrimage visits to the various shrines.
However, the group of five officials along with the two Kataoka officials, two Shingu officials, and two Wakamiya officials make pilgrimage visits to various shrines from Wakamiya to the Nara shrine road, then arrive at the government office seats. The other shrine administrators go directly to the government office seats via the second torii during their pilgrimage rounds. The two Kifune officials do not perform this ritual.
Also, the shrine officials of Shingu and Wakamiya make pilgrimage visits from the middle gate to Tamahashi, Sawada, Nara, and various small shrines, arriving at the government office seats [Note: and so forth]. Which is the original ritual should be investigated [Written in red].

They arrive at the government office seats.

Heading toward the northwest direction, each rider starting from Shidori proceeds north, performs mutual bows with the head priest at the south of the imperial residence, then circles the western courtyard.
At this time, the deputy administrator takes up the brush to record horse coat colors and riders' names etc. on the assignment list《however, only for Shidori, Kanatsu, and Anshi are coat colors and rider names written》
《For those below, only coat color names are briefly recorded. After all riders have passed through the nine turns, the kana document is consulted to note the horse coat colors of Tsuchida and below. This is especially abbreviated》

Finished, mutual bows《each the same as before. Especially there are differences in riding methods and routes as seen in the diagram. Especially for Anshi and Funaki there are route differences》Next, riders head toward the second torii gate, and while mounted, release their stirrups and make one bow, then advance to the horse grounds, enter the barriers from the north, perform nine turns in sequence, dismount, and exit at the western end of the barriers
They line up with the eastern end taking north as the superior position《especially each mounts in hiuchi-style on the turf in front of the second torii gate. In the nine turns, five turns to the victory maple, then four turns below that, it is said. Especially two representatives go first》Next, Shidori's horse and below run in sequence《however, riders point their whips toward the imperial residence three times each》During this time at the imperial residence, the deputy administrator《especially standing on right knee to observe the horses' speed》takes up the brush, and records in order on the assignment list the observations of the head priest and those below regarding speed - fast, medium, slow《especially those observing from behind see the differences of fast, medium, slow and report to the deputy administrator, the deputy administrator consults with the head priest and then writes on the assignment list. However, for Shidori and Kanatsu, "excellent" is recorded. This is ancient precedent. For Anshi and below, fast, medium, slow is recorded according to the horses' speed》Next, all twenty horses finish running, enter the barriers from the north, perform nine turns, exit the barriers going eastward, arrive at the west side of the purification river, and each

dismounts and settles at the imperial residence《each ascends from the southern stairs, first faces the head priest for mutual bows, then settles on long benches. Especially not sitting together in a row. Especially for Shidori and Kanatsu, according to old precedent during the first round pairing, those observing from behind attend to the lower and middle ranks of riders》
《Therefore without dismounting, they directly enter the barriers and run with three slow turns, triple small movements three times. Especially for Shidori, although bringing out a horse, the horse is brought out in order to enter. This is because there is guidance from the head priest that striking differently should be performed in turns. For the rest, today regardless of victory or defeat, upper manor pursuing horse, lower manor leading horse. Especially appointing supervisors on left and right》
《Going first, and from the second round the administrator records: when Shidori and Kanatsu enter the barriers, also pair the second round messengers. If there are two "excellent" ratings, pair with those, if not, pair with "good" ratings. Everything becomes more to the left as seats are higher. For example, if there is one lower seat "good" and no continuation, return to the upper seat and pair with middle "good". Even so, upper horse ground middle "good" is left, lower horse ground "good" is right. After pairing, the second round messenger announces which seats. In any case, watching the upper round barrier entry, pair the next and inform that rider. Up to seven rounds the deputy administrator pairs, for the remainder the riders pair among themselves, it is said》
《This is old precedent. However, due to current circumstances, all ten rounds the deputy administrator pairs. Especially writing first and second, left and right on the assignment list》Next, when the first round left and right horses enter the barriers, for the second round left and right, according to the records the deputy administrator tells the riders their respective manors《same as below》At this time riders rise from seats, mount horses, enter the barrier base with three slow turns, triple small movements three times《triple small movements three times》
《Abbreviated to first round only. Therefore once?》Finished running horses, the rest the same as before. After pairing four rounds, the deputy administrator passes assignment documents to the deputy official《The procedure: deputy administrator rises from seat holding two assignment documents, especially loading them on wooden pieces, descending the eastern stairs, passing them to the deputy official at the southern area of the eastern entrance《however, one theory says stepping over the eaves drip》At this time the deputy official《in purification robes and hakama》receives them, makes mutual bows, and the deputy administrator returns to his seat》The deputy official receives them and stands in line continuing at the river side north of the zelkova tree《facing northwest》《These are rider assignment documents for the coming fifth day. Therefore when passing the third day costumes, they are brought to the office building, added with respectful marks, then returned to the deputy administrator. Especially there are left and right distinctions《especially adding respectful marks below rider names》》

Finished, withdrawing《Now often due to spiritual devotion, those of Shidori and Kanatsu riders perform this and then pass to the deputy official》Regarding the riders, after finishing their runs, they pass by the front of the horse grounds and proceed past various locations

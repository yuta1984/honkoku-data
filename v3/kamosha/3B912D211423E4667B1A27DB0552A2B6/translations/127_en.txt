The ritualist of Kagi Seven Shrines (however, when the Wakamiya negi returns to his seat, he approaches from the western offering hall. This is only when wearing sokutai court dress and both Kibune officials are present. The same applies when Ota negi returns to his position).

Next, Kataoka and the other shrine officials below him proceed to each shrine to offer sacred food in the inner sanctuary. Particularly with Kataoka taking the lead, and those performing the food transfer ritual likewise (one person assigned to each shrine). The tōne and shrine servants attend as usual, but the items of sacred offerings are as follows: shot grass (two pieces), sacred rice (one cup), sliced mackerel (currently two sweetfish are prepared [written in red]), (two sliced pieces), ray fish (two pieces), sacred chopsticks (one pair), sacred cup (three times. The earthenware official prepares and presents these, receiving paper boards for preparation. Sacred sake is served by the tōne at the western offering hall), etc. (All the above go into the sacred chest, but the decorative items are stored in the inner sanctuary).

Next, the five officials take their places at the prayer recitation seat (the ceremony follows the usual protocol). At this time, the assistant chief priest hears that Kataoka dosai has arrived at the balcony (the ceremony involves coming out from the feast hall, ascending the transparent corridor, and arriving first). After the five officials perform one bow at the Wakamiya negi seat, they descend to the balcony and report this to the five officials. After the prayer is completed, they return to their seats, perform a bow, rise, and return to the western offering hall. They report this to the five officials, then the five officials recite prayers and clap their hands (the assembly responds to this).

Next, the returning shrine officials (Kataoka Shingu and Wakamiya shrine officials) arrive as initially. Next, the deputy again advances to the small courtyard holding torches (after the transfer of sacred food from the main shrine's inner sanctuary is completed and the five officials take their prayer seats, the torches are temporarily withdrawn, and after the returning shrine officials arrive, they advance again).

Next, the head priest, chief ritualist, and others enter the inner sanctuary, and the chief negi and those below separate left and right to wait on the upper and lower steps (particularly the Shingu ritualist and those below line up in a single row on the negi side). Next, the food transfer is advanced to the customary place. During this time, the sacred curtains are rolled up. Next, the inner sanctuary sacred food is removed (first, three or five round trays are brought from the western offering hall, at which time the chief negi takes these, stacks them on the large platform, loads the sacred food, and removes it. The ceremony follows the usual protocol).

Procedure for the Mikado-shiro-e Sacred Ritual《June 29th, Last Day of Month, July 1st》

June 29th Mikado-shiro-e Procedure
First, on the previous day, construct a Noh theater stage northwest of the sacred horse stable, using the area behind the sacred horse stable and the bathhouse as dressing rooms.
《For this ceremony, on June 29th (or 28th in a short month), at the hour of the Dragon (7-9 AM), have the six functionaries order carpenters to build it. Now it is built by the repair department. Accordingly, have the six functionaries build temporary shelters for seating and the bridgeway pine trees, then finish and withdraw. At the hour of the Snake (9-11 AM), they proceed further to the viewing areas around the north of the sacred horse stable and in front of the second torii gate, etc.》
《Have Gorotaro and laborers divide the work, drive in desk stakes, stretch ropes, and finish preparing the viewing areas. For the small divisions, young officials with jutte batons manage this as during horse racing》

On the evening of the same day, Noh performers come to the residences of the head priest, chief negi priest, and senior elder for a sake-offering ceremony《Previously at the deputy master's residence there was a sake-offering ceremony, and when finished, the deputy master wore formal court dress to serve as guide, while the Noh performers wore plain jackets》

Tonight for the inner banquet of the Mikado-shiro-e, there are three Noh performances in front of the second torii gate《They perform facing south, particularly facing toward Matsuo direction》

First, they carry the divine form of Sarutahiko deity and bear flutes, large drums, etc., beating time as they proceed to the front of the second torii gate《These are four companions of the Noh performers who converse together. Three wear plain jackets and carry flutes, large drums, small drums, etc. One wears hemp formal dress and goes from Seishinji temple via the first torii gate, sake hall bridge, etc. to the area west of the sacred horse stable fence. At that time, the yatone priest brings the divine form and gives it to those wearing formal dress, so they receive it, beat time, and proceed first along the main route to the front of the second torii gate, face north, clap hands briefly and pause (commonly called "entering the dressing room"). At that time the yatone priest comes and receives back the divine form, then each withdraws. This divine form is normally kept in the small office. On the day in question, the yatone priest comes to the shrine precincts to receive it and returns it to the shrine precincts the following day》

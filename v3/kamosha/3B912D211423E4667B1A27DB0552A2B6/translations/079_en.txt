The sacred horse is led toward the front of the deity <<first it is led inside the torii gate and given respite in the direction above the dancers' seats>>. It circles the shrine platform three times <<circling to the left>> and then exits through the torii gate. Next, the dancers present offerings <<In this procedure, two people at a time from among the ten, starting from the highest ranking, take positions kneeling in the courtyard before the deity. At this time, shrine servants bring public offerings and wait on the left and right. Accordingly, the prayer attendant (tone) from the prayer master's side hands them to the highest ranking, and the prayer attendant from the ritualist's side hands them to the lower ranking. Private offerings are held while seated. Even though they may be of young age, this procedure should not be done this way - it should be arranged with the attendants so that the offerings are handed over after first performing two bows. Currently, many errors have crept in, and this should not be considered the proper procedure>>. After completion, they hand them to the shrine servants. After returning to their seats and each completing their part, they bring them together and present them to both officials <<first to the prayer master's side, then to the ritualist's side>>. Both officials hold them up, stand close to the left and right of the sacred doors, perform one bow, descend to the earthen platform and perform one bow <<at this time there is oral instruction>>, recite return prayers and clap hands. The dancers respond to this <<in recent times this ceremony does not exist>>. After completion, the offerings are removed and handed to the shrine servants <<these offerings become the shrine servants' ceremonial feast>>.

After the ceremony concludes, both officials and the dancers below partake in a ceremonial feast of sacred offerings and sacred sake <<first the sacred offerings are passed through while remaining in the sacred container, then sacred sake is placed in ladles. Shrine servants serve this duty>>. After completion, the sacred horse and dancers below withdraw, exit through the torii gate, mount horses as before, form ranks, and return toward the main shrine's first torii gate <<they dismount below the torii gate, pass through the torii, and mount horses again. In ancient ceremony there was galloping on horseback. This ceremony no longer exists in recent times>>. Next, both officials withdraw, then at Nijima-i, with the sacred horse leading, ten ranks follow in order, circle around three times, then withdraw.

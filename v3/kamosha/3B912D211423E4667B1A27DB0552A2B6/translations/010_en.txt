One prostration below the stairs, dividing left and right to attend at the second level of the stairs《Note: Seated bow - however, since this is a temporary seat there is no seated bow, but facing toward the inner sanctuary, one bow is performed and hems are arranged. The shrine officials below the stairs do not participate in this ritual》

Next, the Kataoka ritualist and Kifune liturgist stand together for one prostration below the stairs, then divide to attend at the fifth level. Next, the Kifune ritualist and Shinmiya liturgist perform one prostration below the stairs, dividing left and right to attend at the sides below the eastern and western stairs. Next, the Shinmiya ritualist and Ota liturgist, then the Ota ritualist and Wakamiya liturgist, then the Wakamiya ritualist and Nara liturgist, then the Nara ritualist and Sawada liturgist, then the Sawada ritualist and Ujigami liturgist, then the Ujigami ritualist and shrine affairs deputy - all of these stand together, each advancing below the stairs for one prostration and one bow. The liturgists each attend on the western side below the western stairs, while the ritualist faction each attend on the eastern side below the eastern stairs.

Next, the offering bearers rise from their seats《Note: seated bow》, pass through the center of the authority hall, still bowing respectfully to attend below the eastern worship pillar of the authority hall, facing diagonally toward the divine presence for one prostration. Then two junior officials lead the advance to the ritualist faction《Note: arriving at Wakamiya worship hall》. Next, the ritualist rolls up the sacred curtain (perhaps). Then the divine offerings are transferred forward from the liturgist faction.

The ceremony involves the deputy director manipulating and bringing out [the offerings], transferring from the revolving [platform] to the deputy, from the deputy to the offering bearers, however the offering bearer group receives them at the center of the authority hall《Note: holding at the center means not passing through》. From the offering bearers it transfers to the shrine affairs deputy, then in that order transfers forward, reaching the chief liturgist who directs it into the inner sanctuary. The round tray is held by the chief liturgist and does not enter the inner sanctuary. After the head priest and ritualist complete offering the ceremonial trays to the three-tiered sacred shelves, the round tray transfers to the deputy ritualist, then in that order withdraws to the ritualist faction, where the offering bearer group receives it and passes it to the director. The director receives it and places it on the shelves of the ritualist faction's offering place, later having the sword bearer retrieve it to the western offering place shelves. However, for the ritualist faction's divine offering transfer, from the offering bearers it reaches the Ujigami ritualist, then in that order transfers forward to reach the deputy liturgist, who directs it into the inner sanctuary. The round tray does not enter the inner sanctuary, and the liturgist follows the same procedure as before. From the deputy liturgist it transfers to the chief liturgist, then in that order withdraws to the liturgist faction, where the head offering bearer receives it and places it on the vermillion-lacquered sacred table below the eastern stairs of the authority hall《Note: However, this sacred table is the eight-legged table that holds daily offerings every time, being the table for the sword bearer's withdrawal distribution. Therefore it is permanently installed》. Furthermore, one head offering bearer attends below the eastern stairs of the authority hall, and after completely withdrawing all trays, performs one prostration, returns to seat and announces the sacred precedence《Note: shrine attendant》.

First, spiced sake《Note: placed on a high stand, filled in one layer of earthenware vessels and placed on a round tray, transferred forward in order, with the head priest arranging it on the great eight-legged table. The arrangement method has separate traditions, but this began to be offered starting from Jōkyō 4, Year of the Rabbit》. Next, sacred chopsticks《Note: one shaku two sun in length, normally kept at the deputy's residence, brought to the shrine head by the minor deputy before divine ceremonies and placed on the round tray. Therefore the deputy directors retrieve it》. Next, bracken fern rice《Note: served in a sacred bowl, placed on flat wood and loaded on a round tray》. Next, rice cake (bu)

(As usual) After the yin-yang master completes purifying his body at the customary place, everyone takes their seats at the transparent corridor, connecting hall, etc. (However, regarding the deputy shrine administrator, as usual, after the ujigami negi takes his seat, he comes from the feast hall to the transparent corridor and sits in the seat next to the ujigami negi).

The ujibito (clan members) and musicians for the tenkū service take their places at the customary locations (however, due to the hafuri side single offerings, the tenkū group sits at the hafuri side connecting hall. Nevertheless, initially while presenting the chopsticks from the negi side and removing the round trays from the hafuri side to the negi side, the two highest-ranking officials sit at the negi side connecting hall seats).

First, the ritual child takes his place at the customary location. Next, the assistant administrator hands over the sacred key to the hafuri. Next, the hafuri rises and advances before the deity to open the sacred doors (musical performance and below are as usual). When this is completed, he descends to the earthen area.

At this time, the chief priest rises and advances to the earthen area, stands alongside and performs one bow, then enters the inner sanctuary. Next, the senior and assistant negi rise and advance to the earthen area, stand alongside and perform one bow, then wait at the great platform. The remaining shrine officials and deputy shrine administrator, etc., as usual, after standing alongside and performing one bow, wait at the upper and lower steps, etc. (However, the two Kifune officials do not participate in this shrine's sacred rituals and proceed directly to the wooden boat).

Next, the hafuri rolls up the sacred curtain. Next, first the chopsticks are presented from the negi side (placed on round trays, with musical performance and presentation as usual, but empty trays are removed to the negi side because there will be sacred offering presentations from the hafuri side). Next, sacred offerings are transferred from the hafuri side (with shrine servants leading throughout).

First, sacred bowls and rice (placed on wooden boards and set on round trays), next sacred carp (one fish, earthenware vessels placed three times on cypress leaves, set on round trays and offered together with the earthenware), next birds (one salted pheasant, serving vessels and below same as before), next raw offerings (five fish, five salted sea bream one fish each, presented in five installments, serving vessels and below same as before, empty trays and wooden boards all removed to the negi side), next layered offerings (fifty pieces of ray fish placed in sacred chests).

Next, wrapped offerings (ten packages of sacred sweets placed in sacred chests, without spoons), next salted sardines (about five fish placed on wooden boards and set on round trays - this is a recent ceremony, see details under New Year's Day section), next Koma offerings (one salted sea bream placed in sacred chest), next sacred sake is presented from the negi side (as usual, but there is no ceremony of combining due to single offerings. For single offerings, regardless of left or right, only negi side sake flasks are used. The empty trays are removed to the negi side. Ōta negi remains at the base of the worship pillar between the railings, then returns to his seat afterward. Previously, the tenkū group returns to the negi side connecting hall after the hafuri side sacred offerings are completed).

Next, the hafuri lowers the sacred curtain. At this time, the ujigami hafuri, deputy shrine administrator, etc. advance to the earthen area, perform one bow, and return to their original seats. Next, the assistant administrator comes to the hafuri side connecting hall and hands over the sacred keys to the hafuri of Kataoka and below. Next, each proceeds to their respective shrines (However, for Sawada Shrine, since shrine servants bring the scooped offerings, the hafuri ascends and offers them in the outer sanctuary. If brought before the ceremony before the deity is completed, the hafuri offers them and both officials recite prayers together in the worship hall. If brought after the ceremony before the deity is finished, after the offering is completed, the hafuri recites prayers at the earthen area. The items for scooped offerings are rice with a little seaweed torn and mixed in, three-sun portions, and cloudy sake placed in small earthenware vessels, but the three-sun portions are placed on top of the rice. Sometimes there is also a practice of bringing them by pouring directly on the rice without using earthenware. Four square high-piled four cups - these are materials for items passed during that day's daily offering withdrawal. However, since ancient times they have been placed together, they were mistakenly offered by accident. This should be called a grave error. In such cases, should those four cups be set aside before offering? However, since they are quite difficult to remove, they are offered despite the mistake).

The Five Officials take their seats for prayers. Next, the assistant administrator comes to the transparent corridor seat and announces that Kataoka's prayers are completed (as usual). Next, the Five Officials recite prayers (as usual). When finished, the chief priest and hafuri rise and enter the inner sanctuary as initially (however, near the western steps, the hafuri advances first like the senior assistant negi. After the shrine officials of Kataoka, Shingu, Wakamiya, etc. complete their respective shrine ceremonies and return to their seats at the transparent corridor, connecting hall, etc., the Five Officials rise). The remaining shrine officials wait at the upper steps as initially.

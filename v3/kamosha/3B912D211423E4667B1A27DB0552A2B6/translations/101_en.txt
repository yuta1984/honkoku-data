(They proceed to the hall, however for Nara, Sawada, and clan shrines, it is one stand). The hafuri takes this and places it directly on the great platform (first the negi side, then the hafuri side). Next, they advance the sacred eight-legged tables (two stands with silk altar cloths). The hafuri places these on top of the sacred offering table (first the negi side, then the hafuri side). Next, they advance the divine offerings (this ritual is like the main shrine outer sanctuary divine offering ritual). After completely preparing everything: one set of sacred chopsticks, sacred rice (one round rice), rays (one slice cut into five pieces), sacred cups (two earthenware pieces with stands). This portion is placed in the sacred box (however, these divine offerings are the regular outer sanctuary morning provisions. For Nara, Sawada, Ota, and clan shrines, morning and evening portions are placed in one sacred box and prepared). They place it on a round tray and advance it, the hafuri takes it and prepares it on the great platform (under the negi side's sacred desk, offering it while still placed on the round tray). Next, the junior transferred offering attendant returns to their seat, the senior attendant performs one bow, descends to the earthen area and waits nearby.

Next, the hafuri performs one bow, descends the stairs, performs one bow and returns to their seat. Next, the senior transferred offering attendant rises and prepares at the sacred offering table (taking the one sacred offering table stand that is always on the hafuri side. However, during festivals, from the sacred eight-legged tables down to the round trays, everything is not used, and divine offerings are regularly prepared in the courtyard (between the standing sand areas). The items include salmon, fresh shellfish, bonito, boiled sea cucumber, salted squid, needlefish, dried horse mackerel, beaten abalone, sacred horse grass, seaweed, kelp, etc., placed in sacred boxes and prepared the day before by the purification robe lottery group). After completion, they perform one bow and return to their seat. Next, both officials rise and perform two bows, recite norito prayers, clap their hands and perform two bows (however, at Kataoka Shrine, when reciting norito prayers, shrine attendants loudly call out "Dosai, Main Shrine, New Shrine, Young Prince Shrine, etc." and upon hearing this, they recite the norito prayers).

Next, the senior transferred offering attendant rises and proceeds to the courtyard, performs one bow, removes the divine offerings and places them in their original location on the sacred offering table, and after completion waits nearby. Next, the hafuri rises and proceeds to the earthen area, performs one bow, ascends to the great platform and performs one bow. Next, the transferred offering attendant (senior) proceeds to the earthen area, and (the junior) descends to the courtyard. Next, they remove the regular morning provisions (while still on the round tray), then remove the outer sanctuary divine offerings (this ritual is like the main shrine ritual, therefore abbreviated). After completion, they remove the sacred offering table (handing it to the transferred offering attendants as initially).

After completion, they perform one bow and descend the stairs. The negi rises and proceeds to the earthen area, they stand in line and perform one bow up and down, enter the inner sanctuary and perform one bow. Next, the transferred offering attendants advance (as initially). Next, the negi and hafuri take the hollyhock and katsura and place them in the left and right scenic object boxes (there is a small storage place in the inner sanctuary; this procedure is oral transmission). After completion, they place the hollyhock and katsura that were offered for purification into the sacred box (on top of the divine offerings). Next, they roll up the sacred curtain, remove the divine offerings, and after completion lower the sacred curtain (if there are salty items on top of the sacred offering table, wipe them with the sacred cup base paper). Next, the negi performs one bow, exits the inner sanctuary, performs one bow up and down, and after completion returns to their seat. Next, the hafuri performs one bow, exits the inner sanctuary, performs one bow and closes the sacred doors (moving from seats and prostrating). Next, the transferred offering attendant (senior) hands the sacred chain to the hafuri and withdraws, the hafuri takes it and wraps the sacred chain, and after completion performs one bow, descends the stairs, performs one bow and descends from the earthen area (shoe bowing). Next, the negi rises, performs one bow, and each withdraws.

Next, after completing the small circuit, they take seats by the riverside (however, in case of rain, under the corridor eaves facing north-up east-facing (or east-up south-facing?). The chief priest takes a seat at the tower gate).

(From the fourth month of Hōreki 6 [1756], the transferred offering attendant of Junior Fourth Rank Lower Yasuchi became his substitute and also began serving the morning and evening outer sanctuary provisions. Now, after removing the outer sanctuary eight-legged divine offerings, they prepare them again on the sacred offering table great platform, prepare the aforementioned divine offerings on top of it, return to the worship hall, recite norito prayers again and after completion remove them. Next, the negi proceeds to the earthen area, stands in line and performs one bow up and down).

(After this, they proceed to the inner sanctuary. However, on the 18th day of the fourth month of Hōreki 8 [1758], clear weather, when Deputy Ota Negi was serving, regarding how to handle the aforementioned outer sanctuary sacred box divine offerings, when inquiring of Hafuri Tomisei, after preparing the outer sanctuary eight-legged divine offerings, they immediately set up a hemp desk beside the negi side's sacred offering table and offer the sacred box on top of it, so it does not require two times).

(The officials, after the hafuri group's norito prayers at the main shrine are completed, withdraw from the divine presence, make pilgrimage rounds to the roadside shrines, change their purification robes and proceed to Kibune). Next, the shrine officials of the seven shrines rise in order (however, since the two Kataoka officials take precedence, the negi descends the stairs and performs one bow).

(After this, without returning to their seats, they proceed directly from the Chinese gate to Kataoka Shrine. The negi each perform seat bowing, but the hafuri do not perform seat bowing). They proceed to a certain shrine (making pilgrimage rounds to the roadside shrines) and prepare divine offerings in the inner and outer sanctuaries (however, the two Kibune officials).

(After the main shrine's norito prayers are completed, they finish the great circuit before the divine presence, change purification robes at the lodging and proceed to Kibune. The divine offerings are placed in karahitsu boxes, with two bearers, and additionally sword-negi and shrine attendants accompanying them. For Kibune's transferred offerings, two people are selected in rotation from among the ten attendants to proceed. The divine offerings for small shrines are provided by those who make daily visits. All of this generally takes place after the horse racing is completed, though the timing is not fixed).

Matters for Subsidiary Shrine Officials to Understand Regarding Festival Service, First Priority: Proceeding to the Divine Presence

1. Upon arriving at a certain shrine, both officials should lower their hems and take their seats on round cushions. During this time, have the sword-negi prepare at the earthen area, and have the sacred eight-legged tables, tripods, two tall offering stands, and two round trays brought out to the worship hall. Next, the hafuri should advance to the earthen area and open the sacred doors.

1. First examine whether the daily offering outer sanctuary sacred box provisions have arrived or not. If they have not arrived, send a shrine attendant to call at the sake hall.

1. The hinoki cypress leaves for the underlays and lid spreads of the tall offering stands should be obtained by instructing the sword-negi. This matter should be communicated to the person in charge of transferred offerings.

1. First examine whether the outer sanctuary sacred offering tables and below, down to the inner and outer divine offerings, are all prepared.

For this procedure, first face the divine presence and perform one bow, then take a seat in the worship hall (shoe bowing, seat bowing, adjusting hems as usual, therefore abbreviated below). After the divine offerings are all prepared, the hafuri rises, advances to the earthen area and performs one bow, ascends to the great platform and performs one bow, then opens the sacred doors (moving from seats and prostrating). Next, the negi rises and advances to the earthen area, the hafuri descends the stairs (each adjusting their hems), they stand in line and perform one bow up and down, enter the inner sanctuary and perform one bow. Next, the transferred offering attendants rise and advance to the earthen area and perform one bow, the senior attendant ascends to the great platform, the junior attendant waits at the earthen area. Next, roll up the sacred curtain. Next, the divine offerings: one set of sacred chopsticks, boat rice (two boats), next boat rice cakes (two boats), salted sea bream (four fish), rays (six pieces), single items (one fish, horse mackerel or mackerel), garlic (two pieces), hinoki bark rice dumplings (two pieces), salted sardines (two fish), sacred cups (three times, one earthenware cup with paper base, the sacred sake is poured by the sword-negi at the negi group's shelf), sacred hollyhock (two bunches), katsura (two branches, etc., above the divine offerings). This portion is placed in the sacred box and transferred forward, with both officials taking it and preparing it on top of the sacred offering table (beforehand, the purification sacred hollyhock and katsura prepared on top of the sacred offering table are moved to the edge of the sacred offering table, and when removed, they are placed in the sacred box and removed above the divine offerings). Next, lower the sacred curtain. Next, the senior transferred offering attendant waits at the earthen area, the junior attendant withdraws to the worship hall (after instructing the sword-negi to arrange the divine offerings at the worship hall, the divine offerings are transferred forward from the worship hall to the earthen area). Next, in the inner sanctuary the negi performs one bow, exits the inner sanctuary and after performing one bow up and down, returns to the worship hall. Next, the hafuri performs one bow, exits the inner sanctuary and performs one bow. Next, the transferred offering attendants advance to the sacred offering table (two legs, from worship).

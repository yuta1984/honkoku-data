Next, one person each from the shrine maiden side and ritualist side knife-bearers (tōne) hold straw circular mats (one each), first the left side dances out three steps (facing north, advancing with lateral dancing)
Next the right side likewise dances out three steps (facing north lateral dancing, same as before), then left three dances, again right three dances, next left three dances, next right three dances, completing left and right three-by-three nine dances and arriving at the south head of the standing sand, laying out those circular mats (left and right the same) and when finished returning to the original place (the Suetoshi Record says the dance return ceremony is the same as before, but now that ceremony does not exist)

Next holding bow and arrows (left and right, but the provider of these bow and arrows is unclear and should still be inquired about) performing three-by-three nine dances (as initially) and placing them near the south of the standing sand. Next the left and right knife-bearers gird swords (now held in hand. This sword is the sword worn by the sword-bearer office. Therefore it is borrowed. The deputy middle ceremony official says regarding borrowing the knife-bearer's sword, when they requested to borrow it, they were told it was unprecedented but were allowed to borrow it. Afterwards it is returned to the sword-bearer)

Dancing out three-by-three nine dances as initially and settling on the circular mats (facing north), left and right facing each other opening fans (left fan? The Suetoshi Record says they open seven parts. The left side holds in the right hand, the right side uses the fan with the left hand, this being a ceremony of respectful reverence. How is this ceremony? Should still be inquired about)

Regarding the fans (the clan record says that settling on circular mats and both sides using fans once is a symbol of celebrating great peace. This dancing approach is a ceremony of caution. To give an analogy, when the enthronement prince's representative ceremony concludes, there is advancing sideways half-crouched to approach the front central space of the palace high granary. Direct walking lacks cautious ceremony so it is done this way. Does this reasoning correspond? When ceremonial rites are meticulous, when advancing to the center of the courtyard, dancing approach out of fearful caution is most appropriate)

When finished, holding the circular mats along with bow and arrows, swords, etc., both left and right return to the enclosure area (the Suetoshi Daily Record says this time returning is not the original ceremony. Originally this is for settling for sumo guard duty. In recent years there may be errors in this ceremony, and further examination should be added)

Next, sumo matches
The ceremony first involves the left official (Matsu official wearing samurai court cap and plain jacket, holding a fan and proceeding first. The Seirei Diary says that on the 9th day of the 9th month of Jōkyō 3rd year, sumo officials began wearing plain jackets starting from today. What was it like previously?)
Leading five sumo wrestlers (the Suetoshi Diary says on the 9th day of the 9th month of Tenna 4th year, ten sumo wrestlers were led, today it is five. Perhaps due to abbreviated ceremony? Both right and left officials prepare under the music hall eaves)
Making sequential circuits (left circuits) around the courtyard three times, then approaching and crouching in rows on the west side (about the west of the ground-taking circle, arranged north to south facing east)

After Ōta ritualist Tomikiyo's two sumo matches concluded, how about participation? [written in red]

During this time (after some two or three matches conclude) the duty shrine official rises from the earthen building, crosses the reed blind bridge (shrine maiden west, ritualist east) and jewel bridge, etc., advances from the tower middle gate to before the deity, and prepares the outer sanctuary evening offerings. The items include sacred rice and below along with rotating offerings (the duty group), attended by senior officials and food officials (Taguchi) etc. as usual (the clan record says sumo is between morning offerings and evening offerings. Also on the 9th day of the 9th month of Hōei 6th year, Chō-uji participated as Seirei's representative. This day Seirei was on guard duty. People debated whether evening offering preparation was before or after sumo, and it was decided by later ceremony that today Chō-uji participated after sumo concluded. In my opinion, how about now when many prepare offerings during the midst of sumo?)

Next the right official (same as left) leads five sumo wrestlers making sequential circuits (right circuits) three times, then crouching in rows on the east side (northeast of the ground division circle)

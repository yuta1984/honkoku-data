Next, each person takes the rice fruit distributed earlier and throws it away while still wrapped toward the upper area of Nara Stone Bridge (this is a ritual for removing five-grain disasters. Hold it in the left hand and throw it backward). When finished, everyone withdraws.

At this time, the assistant hafuri, deputy shrine administrator, ritual child, and purification leaders go from Nara Stone Bridge toward the sacred substitute rice fields, set up sakaki branches, offer sacred sake, and plant early rice seedlings. When finished, they proceed to the lower sacred fields, and the ritual is the same as before.

The deputy shrine administrator, ritual child, assistant hafuri, etc. take seats on long platforms facing south with western precedence, with the western deputy administrator taking the upper seat as he oversees this matter. The ritual child in the center, assistant hafuri to the east. First, long platforms are laid out in the upper area of the sacred fields, slightly west of center, and the field ground is dug with hoes, and two sakaki branches with four streamers are erected. The chief priest's attendants perform this duty, and sacred sake is offered in front of the erected sakaki. Either the deputy shrine administrator or hafuri makes the offering. The sacred sake utensils consist of one pair of pewter vessels, two pieces of ray fish, small amounts of seaweed (now there is no seaweed), two triple earthenware cups each, and parched rice mixed with soybeans placed in small containers. These are prepared and provided by the chief priest and brought by attendants. After making the offerings, congratulatory words praying for a bountiful year are spoken, two bows are performed, and double clapping is done as usual, with the purification leaders responding. Next, early rice seedlings are presented to the deputy shrine administrator, ritual child, assistant hafuri, etc. These seedlings are prepared in advance by the attendants. At this time, the deputy shrine administrator, ritual child, and assistant hafuri throw the seedlings into the sacred fields (sometimes thrown before the prayers).

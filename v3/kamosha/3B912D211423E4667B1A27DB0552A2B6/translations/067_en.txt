Banquet Diagram

[Diagram section]
Layout diagrams for transferred offerings, subsidiary shrine offering arrangements, seating arrangements at the banquet hall (south seats, north seats)

The detailed diagram shows positions of rice offerings, senior officials, and arrangements of dumplings and sweetfish. 《This location was originally the seat for subsidiary shrine offerings, but in recent times there has been confusion in arrangements, resulting in this configuration. Therefore, during the initial banquet, the Azumi River banquet is held at this location》

《What is on the left side of the shrine official consists of three-colored sweetfish dumplings stacked, received and dyed, then passed to the south seats. What is on the right side consists of three-colored sweetfish dumplings stacked, received and dyed, then passed to the next seats. During evening meals, paper stands are separated, replaced and passed through. Whether paper stands are present or not sometimes differs between left and right sides, appearing to depend on the sword-bearing priest's judgment》

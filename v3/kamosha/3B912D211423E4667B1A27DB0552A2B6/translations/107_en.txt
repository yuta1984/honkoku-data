I record here a general account of what I observed while serving as deputy for Shingu negi Junior Fourth Rank Lower Yasutora during this year's festival on the 12th day of the 4th month (rainy day). Details should be sought through further inquiry.

Uematsuri (Plant Festival) (The date is not fixed, but is determined at the office building either during the assembly meeting in late 4th month, or during the festival sacred offering feast)
(Tenmei 7, 44th execution, the festival was on the 24th day of the 4th month. This ceremony is discussed at the preliminary assembly) (Tenpō 4, Mi year, 44th execution, the festival was on the 21st day of the 4th month. The daily offerings of the 21st day were presented on the 23rd day)

First, on the appointed day, the morning and evening daily offerings of the main shrine and subsidiary outer sanctuaries are presented, with the duty shrine official serving this role (the feast is as usual, but since the evening offerings are served at the seats, there is therefore no feast). When the appointed time arrives (after three announcements, around the Wei hour), each shrine official (dressed in court costume with one attendant) assembles at the waiting place (the ceremony is as usual, but the deputy shrine administrator and yin-yang master each wear court costume, the ritual child wears chihaya and loose hair, the tenkū group wears pure white robes and sashimuki, etc., and they assemble at the shrine grounds before the appointed time).

After the preparations are complete, the administrator dayu (in pure white robes) comes and takes his seat at the Mi position (within the lower interval room). Each assembled person asks "Shall we set up the sacred offerings?" and the chief priest answers that they should be set up (at this time the administrator dayu faces the offering hall and reports this to the bettō).

Next, everyone rises and takes their place at the earth building (the ceremony is as usual). Next, the sacred offerings depart (but this is only the hafuri side offerings. In this ceremony, first one shrine servant proceeds ahead carrying sakaki branches).

Before the Monkey hour, next one sake flask (with silk cover, carried by toneri), next seven sacred offering chests for the seven shrines (each with silk cover, carried by toneri), next the shrine servant proceeding ahead (same as above), next seven sacred offering chests for the main shrine hafuri side each (with silk covers, carried by toneri), plus one empty sacred chest (this is needed when removing the sacred offerings), etc., all depart from the worship hall. The aforementioned sake flask, seven shrine sacred offerings, empty sacred chests, etc. go from the negi quarters via the bamboo bridge, through the jewel bridge, tower gate, middle gate, etc., entering through the side door to reach the western sacred place. The hafuri side sacred offerings go from the negi quarters via the bamboo bridge through the connecting hall and the Shingu gate, Chinese gate, etc., to reach the eastern offering place. Naturally, the bettō and administrator accompany them as usual.

At this time, the yin-yang master performs complete purification at the customary place. Next, the chief priest and below rise and advance before the deity (the ceremony is...)

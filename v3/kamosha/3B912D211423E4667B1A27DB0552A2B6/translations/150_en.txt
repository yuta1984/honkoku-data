The ritual prayers are recited (as usual) and completed.
Each person performs a direct bow (The Shigemura Record states that before the ritualist's prayers, the farmer brings the outer rice stalks and presents them to the deputy shrine administrator, assistant ritualist, abstinence children, etc. At that time they are divided into three parts, sounded three times between the sakaki branches, and prayers are recited). Next, an abstinence child takes wisteria vines and binds and entangles the left and right thumbs of the arrow sword-bearer, inserting sakaki (one branch) between both thumbs, and also using wisteria vines to hang it on the forehead. Then this arrow sword-bearer follows the sacred presence toward the ritualist's pavilion (however, in modern times wisteria vines are not used, but rather rice straw or twisted paper for binding and entangling. For young abstinence children, one of the deputy shrine administrators or assistant ritualists takes their place in this role). Next, everyone withdraws. At this time the arrow sword-bearer goes first to announce the sacred presence (at three designated places along the route: first once when entering the Takegahana Gate, next once when crossing the Imai Bridge, next when arriving at the ritualist's pavilion - three times in total). The farmer carries the rice stalks following along, brings them to the ritualist's pavilion and stores them there. The vines binding the arrow sword-bearer are untied and he withdraws.

The procedure is that the deputy shrine administrator, assistant ritualist, etc. withdraw directly after the ceremony concludes, while the arrow sword-bearer, farmer, etc. proceed to the ritualist's pavilion (the vines binding the arrow sword-bearer are said to be untied and removed by the ritualist's wife).

Sequence of Procedures for Worship Before the Tutelary Deity
First, both officials, the head priest, etc. visit the tutelary deity shrine and take their seats in the worship hall.
Next, the shrine maiden rises from her seat, approaches the divine presence, offers the sacred food containers, sacred sake, etc., and returns to her seat. The head priest approaches for the food transfer.
Next, both officials recite ritual prayers. The head priest responds to them.
Next, the ritualist rises from his seat, removes the sacred food containers, sacred sake, etc., and returns to his seat. The head priest follows this as initially.
Next, both officials move to seats in the curtained area (currently they do not sit there until after the offering of sacred objects).
Next, the dancers approach and take seats on the long platform on the north side within the torii gate.
Next, both officials rise and take circular seats in the courtyard before the divine presence. The shrine attendants relay two sets each of public and private sacred offerings.
Next, both officials complete the offering of sacred objects, advance before the divine presence and stand close to the sacred doors, then descend to the earthen area.

Next, the deputy ritualist with Kataoka liturgist《Note: However, the Kataoka liturgist, after performing one bow at the main shrine, does not return to his seat but exits directly through the Chinese gate, raises his robe hem and proceeds to Kataoka Shrine. The deputy ritualist returns to his original seat after one bow》

During this time, the deputy master passes the sacred keys to the ritualists of the seven shrines《Note: However, the seven shrines refer to all shrines except Kibune Shrine. The manner of receiving the sacred keys is the same as for the chief ritualist. The sacred key of Kibune Shrine is kept by the head shrine maiden》

The deputy master's route is as in the beginning.

Next, the shrine officials of the seven shrines rise from their seats and proceed to their respective shrines.

In this ceremony, both liturgists and ritualists place the Kataoka shrine officials first. Both Kataoka officials exit through the eastern and western Chinese gates, raise their robe hems, and exit through the middle gate and tower gate. They perform one bow at Tanao Shrine and proceed to Kataoka Shrine. Both Shinmiya officials make rounds visiting Sugio, Hajio, Wakamiya, Fujioo, Yamao and others along the route and head toward Shinmiya. The Wakamiya ritualist passes through the connecting hall from the ritualist faction and arrives directly at Wakamiya worship hall. The liturgist makes rounds visiting Sugio, Hajio and others and arrives at Wakamiya worship hall.

The liturgists and ritualists of Ōta, Nara, and Sawada first perform distant worship at Sugio, Hajio, Wakamiya, Yamao, Shinmiya, Fujioo, Kawao, Kataoka, Suwa, Tamabashi, Kagei, Matsuo, Ujigami and others, make rounds visiting Iwamoto and others, and proceed to Nara and Sawada shrines.

The Ōta liturgist and ritualist proceed from there to Kajita and Fujiki shrines, perform one bow at Ōta torii, and proceed to the front of Ōta Shrine. The Ujigami liturgist and ritualist make rounds visiting the shrines from Sugio Shrine to Suwa Shrine, perform distant worship of the eastern shrines near Negi Bridge, next perform one bow at Hashimoto Shrine, next perform one bow when exiting the second torii, and proceed to Ujigami Shrine.

In this ceremony, both officials face the sacred presence, perform one bow, and take their seats《Note: However, robe hem arrangements, footwear, bowing, and seated bowing below the worship hall are as usual》

However, Kataoka Shrine has a divided worship hall. Therefore, the liturgist and both ritualists sit on the eastern side, in the seats next to the offering bearers and ritualist. Although Ōta Shrine has a divided worship hall, they use one side on the western part. First, round cushions and small mats are set up. However, at Sawada Shrine there is a permanent stream between the sacred presence and worship hall. This bridge is not permanent. During ceremonies, there is a wooden bridge within the viewing space, so they summon and install it. Furthermore, the keys to the viewing spaces of Nara and Sawada are at the shrine grounds, so during main shrine ceremonies they summon and retrieve them, first opening Sawada Shrine, then Nara, and afterward having the shrine officials summon for Nara Shrine.

Proceeding to the Attendants' Building
　First, putting on shoes near the board fence, passing through the Nara Shrine's Kasukaji Attendants' Office, ascending from the south entrance, first greeting the shrine officials who arrived early
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 《Note: Head priest, chief liturgist, chief ritualist facing east?》
　After greetings and ritual hand washing, they take their seats. The head priest sits in the center, the chief liturgist on the right, the ritualist on the left, each facing east《Note: Chief liturgist faces north, ritualist faces south》
　
　Five food servers《Note: wearing pure white robes and hakama》, purified children《Note: wearing chihaya and loose hair》, deputy shrine administrator《Note: wearing robes and court cap》, yin-yang master《Note: wearing robes and court cap》, deputy administrator《Note: wearing pure white robes and hakama》, purification leaders《Note: five people》, and the superintendent of the sacred wardrobe all gather at the shrine grounds.
　
　First, the divine offerings for tooth-hardening depart from the offering hall《Note: Like daily offerings, placed in vermillion-lacquered spicy boxes, carried by two shrine attendants, with kitchen staff assisting but no advance guard》. Entering the west offering hall, the superintendent makes one bow at the earthen platform of the main shrine, ascends to the great platform and makes one bow. Then the lion-dogs on the left and right approach and press forward. Where the usual lion-dogs are present, as the kitchen staff for tooth-hardening ascend the stairs, as the first of the food service, six earthen tall cups are loaded on trays and transported《Note: The tall cups are prepared as ceremonial vessels》. The superintendent offers them to the chief liturgist's side《Note: two sets each》, then to the ritualist's portion《Note: same as before》.
　
　Next, the tooth-hardening offerings are transferred. First, one covered cup with melon fruit pierced and placed in an earthen vessel with the earthen vessel as a lid. The earthen vessel on the right is prepared as a ceremonial vessel《Note: At the Taguchi house it is called a mortar》. It is placed on a large wooden board《Note: External dimensions one shaku four sun, rim height six bu, internal dimensions nine sun three bu. The interior of the wooden board is entirely covered with half-sheets of paper cut in two, placed on top of one tall cup》. Second, one mirror rice cake《Note: About four sun five bu in diameter. The above twelve are prepared by the arrow-sword attendant》《Note: Two are for the left and right of the main shrine, eight are for the eight subsidiary shrines. The remaining two are for the thanksgiving direct meeting of the kitchen staff》. Kai-shaped item《Note: One salted sweetfish wrapped in paper with the tail end cut in tail shape》. One leek-type daikon radish《Note: Thin, from the third month}}《Note: The daikon is also wrapped in paper but without cutting. The daikon mentioned above, as well as the daikon for daily offering soup throughout the year, are sown and brought by Uemon Gorōtarō as his official duty in the kitchen staff's territory. This ceremony no longer exists in recent times》. These three items are placed on the large wooden board and set on top of the earthen tall cups. Third, two high-piled cups of daikon《Note: This is sutoki-style piling}}. One cut piece of daikon is fully placed in the earthen vessel, with fermented bean paste powder placed on top. The fermented bean paste powder is an equal mixture of rice bran and rice flour with glutinous rice flour, prepared at the imperial kitchen, called "imperial powder" at the kitchen staff house. Among these three items, white daikon and purple daikon are arranged on top in alternating three-layered chrysanthemum shapes. A thin skewer is inserted in the center of the high pile as decoration, called "imperial item," made from chisel wood.

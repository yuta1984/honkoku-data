They clap their hands, rise, and perform two bows. Next, the hafuri becomes the offering bearer, rises from his seat and advances to the large platform to remove the sacred offerings from the outer sanctuary.

The advancing and retreating are as at the beginning, so this is abbreviated. After the removal is completed, the sacred serving tray is hung and placed on the balustrade on the shōgi side as at the beginning. The offering bearer removes the sacred container, passes it to the shrine servants, and waits for the shōgi side at the earthen platform.

Next, the negi rises from his seat and advances to the earthen platform as at the beginning. Both officials stand side by side and perform one bow, advance to the large platform and perform one bow, enter the inner sanctuary and perform one bow. Next, the offering bearer advances to the large platform. Next, both officials roll up the sacred curtain. Next, they remove the sacred offerings from the inner sanctuary.

The ritual procedure is: they take what is inside the sacred container and place sacred cup stand paper《Note: half-paper cut in two》on top of the sacred serving tray. Both officials remove the sacred container and pass it to the offering bearer. After completion, they lower the sacred curtain, take the stand paper and wipe the salt residue etc. from the sacred serving tray, putting this in their breast pocket《Note: however, of the two officials, especially the hafuri role》. The offering bearer receives this and passes it to the tone《Note: the tone receives this, places it in the worship hall, and after storing the sacred doors, carries it to the offering hall and passes it to the administrator》. After completion, they wait for the shōgi side at the earthen platform. Next, they lower the sacred curtain. Next, the shōgi performs one bow, exits the sacred inner sanctuary and returns to the worship hall《Note: bowing salute as at the beginning》.

Next, the hafuri performs one bow, exits the inner sanctuary, performs one bow, and closes the sacred doors《Note: before this, the negi and those below observe the atmosphere, each moving from their seats and prostrating themselves. Most importantly, they complete the matching sacred lock and additional sacred lock cover》. Next, the offering bearer advances the sacred lock to the hafuri.

They wrap the lock in thick paper《Note: one sheet of senkuwa cut in four, one each, used for one shrine》. Most importantly, they wrap this paper and the sacred lock around a white wooden skewer about one foot long.

The skewers etc. are prepared and offered by the deputy senior official throughout the year. These are placed together with the sacred cups on the shelves of the western offering place, and the tone puts them in the sacred container. Therefore, the tone first places them in the worship hall, and after closing the sacred doors, passes them to the offering bearer. They perform one bow and withdraw from the earthen platform, the hafuri takes this and wraps the sacred lock. After completion, they perform one bow《Note: most importantly, when advancing the sacred lock wrapping, they also pass the sacred key to the offering bearer. However, nowadays they mostly hold and carry the sacred key as at the beginning, and pass it to the deputy senior official when there is still time after withdrawing. Moreover, nowadays they often do not arrive at the worship hall, and the shrine officials of Wakamiya pass it directly to the offering bearer》《Note: for these three people, this ritual directly follows the main shrine's sacred offering removal procedure. Therefore it is like this. These three people refer to the hafuri of Kataoka, Shingū, and Wakamiya》.

They descend to the earthen platform, perform one bow and return to their original seats. Next, the offering bearer removes the tooth-hardening food.

The advancing and retreating of this ritual are as at the beginning. The tone receives this, puts it in the sacred container as at the beginning, and carries it to the offering hall.

Next, each person withdraws.

The two officials of Kataoka proceed directly from the tower gate and middle gate to the seats of the eastern and western corridor galleries. The shōgi and hafuri of Wakamiya and Shingū, after their shrine affairs are completed, make pilgrimage rounds to Kataoka, Suwa shrines etc., and enter the tower gate from the jeweled bridge.

　request and receive it from the shrine grounds, performs blessings for it at the worship hall and withdraws. Also, since the shrine official of Ota clan deity is in a distant location, he either
　relies on other shrine officials, or has subordinates request and receive it afterward. The shrine officials of Kataoka, Shingu, and Wakamiya shrines, together with Gomiya, at
　the ritual assistant crossing hall perform blessings for it. However, this varies depending on the time.

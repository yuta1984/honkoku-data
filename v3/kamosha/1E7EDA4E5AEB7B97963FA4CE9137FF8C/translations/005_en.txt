The Kuranonosuke and Yamashiro-no-suke were in such haste that (details) were omitted from the record. Yamashiro-no-suke wore his sword, and Kuranonosuke held the official offerings at the front. Umasuke was also dressed in formal attire.

The imperial messenger was Chūjō Takayoshi Ason, when he was still serving as Shōshō (Minor Captain). In that house, musical instruments for court dance were elegantly arranged.

The decorated carriages were predetermined and prepared in the music hall. After the Kōchō regulatory document, the Konoe guards were also formally attired, with only the deputy horse officers remaining. The射狩 (hunting officials), stable attendants, guards, and ox-drivers simply followed the usual annual customs.

Regarding the female messengers, the myōbu court ladies and kurōdo (chamberlains) were also omitted from the record. When the Saiin (High Priestess) was present, there was purification ritual, with the ben (controller) crossing Ichijō Avenue, the tenji (court lady) visiting the shrine, and returning from Murasaki-no.

The order of dressing in sacred garments: First is the sacred hakama undergarment, next the sacred robe, next the sashinuki trousers,
next the sacred naoshi court dress, next the sacred belt, next the sacred flat wrapping, next the sacred
fan. These are arranged by the shrine priests at the stairs and presented.

The shrine administrator sits here. The shrine priests take their places in order. Many clan members from the Sacred Birthplace
keep rhythm and sing songs as they exit. At this time there is the ceremony of return songs.

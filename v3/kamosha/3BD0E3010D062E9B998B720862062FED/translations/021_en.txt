After that, the Sukune pours sake on the large table and makes the usual
announcements. The shrine administrator claps hands and sets up chopsticks. Then they divide the large table,
place paper before the shrine priests, lower the sake cups, and set up chopsticks.
When the ceremony ends, they personally bring out the items from before.《marginal note: This is likely because it is a palace ritual. This should be understood》
When the seating ceremony ends, each person goes around from the shrine rear, past the north of the sutra hall, through
the front of the music hall, and prepares to come before the sacred presence. The ritual officiant
opens the sacred doors and presents - this is the usual practice. The shrine administrator comes (first pausing briefly), and when the hollyhock and katsura arrive
(until the festival, feet are placed briefly before the sacred presence), the shrine priests go to their respective shrines. The shrine administrator and Five Officials approach the seat for ritual prayers, and
this ceremony follows the usual practice. When the sacred ritual prayer ends, only the ritual officiant comes and
offers purification water (immediately from the ritual prayer seat). The shrine priests circle around, cross the arched bridge, and
sit within the tower gate, place the ceremonial meal, set up with hollyhock, so that the people may
receive it. The clan members present the hollyhock from before the sacred presence to the shrine priests《marginal note: hollyhock is worn as head decoration, katsura is inserted at the waist》
When hollyhock comes to the worshippers, the shrine priests withdraw. The above completes the description.

If there was a misunderstanding, since we would humbly receive the command issued officially this time, that would settle the matter, so we inquired privately whether there might be some mistake and sought their opinion. They responded that they understood the details completely. They would have their officials investigate and examine the matter. Please wait for a while. During this time, it appears that Miyake Ōi, the duty officer for the Imperial Garden Administration, was summoned for questioning. Indeed, Nishiike Nuinodono's direct subordinate came out as the duty officer to give greetings. Subsequently, Mikawa-no-kami appeared and explained: "We had our officials investigate, and indeed, as the farmers stated, from the 18th to the 25th, for eight days, they petitioned and were granted the allocation. So they would naturally say what they did. This is indeed a troublesome matter." Though he looked apologetic, he neither said we should refrain from consulting the densō nor that we should proceed with the consultation. He only said that this matter could not be resolved as it stood. Therefore, we responded: "If that is the case, though we regret it, we have no choice but to proceed and submit our inquiry." We also stated: "As we obtained your esteemed opinion from Lord Machiguchi Mino-no-kami the other day, regarding the imperial water allocation, according to ancient precedent, orders have been issued from the Tani family to the shrine administration, and the shrine administration has exercised authority over it. With the Koyama farmers making various demands as they have recently, it becomes difficult to maintain the ancient precedent. While the matter of the Koyama aqueduct is exceptional, regarding the river systems outside the aqueduct, we request that you arrange for imperial water to be allocated to the shrine administration regardless of the amount." We then presented for review the documents that had been issued from the intermediary officials to the shrine. When we showed four written statements from Nishiike Saburōemon, Kizaka Izumi-no-kami, Sahara Oribe-shō, Nishiike Izumo-no-kami, Fujiki Shima-no-kami, Togai Iwami-no-kami, and Iimuro Echizen-no-kami, Mikawa-no-kami said: "This matter requires no review; I am already aware of it." However, since we had brought them, he said he would first take a look. We showed the original documents, then took them back and left copies before returning. Then we went to visit Lord Magistrate Ben, where Mizutani Mokku received us. We explained the entire situation and submitted a written inquiry. He said he would review it and report, and that we should first withdraw to our lodging.

Accordingly, we rested at the woodworker's place in our lodging. Around the hour of the Boar, a joint letter arrived from Ishii Mondo and Mizutani Mokku, commanding us to appear. We immediately went, where Mizutani Mokku appeared and announced: "Your written inquiry has been received. Regarding the matter of Koyama Village, further investigation will be conducted." Additionally, today, besides the written inquiry, we presented for review copies of the court ladies' documents, copies of accompanying letters from the densō, petitions from Koyama Village farmers to the shrine administration from Kyōhō 12, 5th month, petitions from the shrine administration to Lord Manrikōji Ben, extracts from shrine records, and authorization documents from the intermediary officials. All were returned without exception, with only the written inquiry and the statement submitted by the Koyama farmers this time being retained. This matter was reported to His Excellency Densō Hamuro Chūnagon, and we returned home at 9:30.

Copy of the Written Inquiry
　　　　　　Respectfully Submitted Statement of Inquiry
Due to the current drought, planting in Kamo Imperial Shrine Territory has become difficult, so we petitioned for allocation of water from the imperial pond. Based on precedent, the allocation was quickly granted, for which we are deeply grateful and honored. However, after receiving this imperial water allocation, we distributed it to various locations in the shrine territory and gave strict instructions for planting without any exceptions. Then farmers from Koyama Village came to the shrine administration and reported: "Regarding the imperial pond water allocation, two Koyama Village farmers named Seibei and Kyūzaemon petitioned the palace officials directly and received permission. They have already received their allocation from the 18th of last month to the 25th of this month, so they cannot comply with the shrine administration's current directive." This matter has, since ancient times, been handled according to precedent whereby Koyama farmers would petition the shrine administration, and the shrine administration would then petition and receive the allocation. However, these farmers violated precedent by petitioning the palace officials directly, which was improper conduct, and the same situation has occurred this time. Moreover, regarding the petition submitted by the Koyama Village farmers, the shrine administration was not informed, though by ancient precedent, the allocation should be received by the shrine administration.

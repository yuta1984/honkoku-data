27th day, 乙亥, Cloudy - Due to the Aoi Festival, the ceremonial stipend was distributed and I received one koku as usual.

28th day, 丙子, Cloudy - The estate succession petition for the late Seo Yahei's residence was settled through a testament petition. Accordingly, it was publicly announced today. Tomorrow, the 29th, the funeral will be held at Hōon-ji temple at the hour of Yatsu (around 2-3 PM), as informed by his clansman Jibei.

29th day, 丁丑, Cloudy - At the hour of Yatsu, for the funeral of the late Seo Yahei, I sent Aoki Hikobei as my representative to offer incense, and also as my proxy for seeing off the deceased. However, lanterns were deemed unnecessary and not sent. Also, regarding Chiyozō's representation, it is arranged that clansman Jibei will handle and provide this. I gave Hikobei one sealed packet of silver as a courtesy payment.

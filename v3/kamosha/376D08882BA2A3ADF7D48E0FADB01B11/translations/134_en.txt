From the Horikawa house in the seat, Misa, O, Mitsu, Chiyozō, and Tomi rode in palanquins and had lunch at Fujimori. They arrived in Uji after the hour of the Sheep and rested briefly at a teahouse at the eastern end of Uji Bridge. During this time, Mie and Tomi returned home. Soon after, Kyōsen made his first visit, wearing only a haori. A clerk came to meet them at the Hoshino gate wearing only hakama. They rested in a separate room at the Hoshino house, and after bathing, put on formal hemp kamishimo.

However, today gifts were sent: to Shūi, one box of fish and 100 hiki in money; to Jukkōin, a white obi sash, hand towel, small folding fan for the household, and three fans; to Tomi, small correspondence and shibori-dyed items; to Kazō, one pair of tabi, barley straw pongee, and printed fabric. Additionally, as souvenirs for Mie's return home, 170 pieces of side manjū, nikō, and blue items mixed together were sent.

They were then shown to the main room, where first thin tea, tobacco powder, tray sweets, ritual stands, and ceremonial items were served. Next came clam soup, and for mukōzuke: wrapped rice cakes on paper, shaved bonito, rolled squid, pickled plums, etc. Sake was served in a pair of pewter vessels. Kyōsen, Yasuko, and Kyōki sat facing, while Shūi, Jukkōin, and Mie sat to the side, and Jukōin performed the marriage cup ceremony. After this, Hoshino relative Kambayashi San'nyū joined the gathering. After initial introductions and greetings, more soup was served with fugu, sea bream, five types of sushi, inkstone lids, pike conger, white plates, shrimp, lily bulbs, and iwatake mushrooms. After two or three rounds, Shūi gave a speech and changed from formal hemp kamishimo to just hakama. Next came bowl dishes of sea bream with shiso, layered fish dishes with horse mackerel and small sardines, ginkgo nuts, and sea vegetables, and bowl dishes of sweetfish and abalone. The formal meal consisted of one soup and three dishes: soup with ark shells and iwatake, simmered dishes with bean paste and mushrooms, three types of shiitake, raw fish salad with daikon, sea bream and iwatake garnish, grilled salted sea bream, and pickled vegetables. After this came the final soup course with prepared sea bream in clear broth. Finally, sweets of early plum blossoms and persimmons were served. After several more rounds, past the hour of the Boar, the celebratory cups were concluded auspiciously, and everyone retired to their lodgings. The five porters were given a meal by the Hoshino family upon arrival and departed immediately after being served.

3rd day, Hinoto-tora, clear. In the early morning, taking Yasuko, Kyōki, and Chiyozō along, with Ieji and Munetate as guides, they toured Byōdōin Temple. The ancient pine of Ōgi-no-shiba had been damaged by the great wind on the 14th of last month.

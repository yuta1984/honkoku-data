As the portion for delicacies, I presented one piece of nanryō silver, which was delivered to Murakami of the meal service.

16th Day, Hinoe-Ne: Rain. I was invited by the new Four Heads Shigeyoshi for his first participation meeting, and I attended along with Keikan and others. ○ In the evening, there was a meeting of the lacquerware magistrates at Ujishōtei, where I participated in discussions and decisions. Since there had been some errors in the order of service rotation up to now, it was decided that from tomorrow the 17th, the third group would begin their duties. Accordingly, notices were posted and circulated.

18th Day, Tsuchinoe-Tora: Clear. At the Hour of the Snake, before the pillar-raising ceremony at the main shrine, drums were beaten. I brought my third son Keiyoshi to the shrine as usual, and visited up to Kataoka Shrine. At the shrine grounds, I offered prayers - first for the joy of raising the pillars, then for the storehouse construction to proceed swiftly without obstacles. At that time, offerings for the morning service were presented to the outer sanctuary of the main shrine's temporary hall, and musicians performed music as customary. Before long, the head priest and all shrine officials, dressed in court robes, proceeded from the council chamber in the procession of shrine attendant magistrates to the shrine grounds, where they waited as worshippers gradually assembled. Shortly after, Western Magistrate Matsudaira Ise-no-kami arrived and took his seat in the ceremonial pavilion.

Under the auspicious pillars, the head carpenter placed ritual offerings at the appropriate moment, the blessing carpenter followed the same procedure, and after the two master builders made rotating offerings, they added sake from ceremonial vessels, circulated them, performed the same on both sides, concluded the offerings, scattered [rice/salt], and withdrew. The magistrate departed, followed by the shrine officials and others. Meanwhile, as the carpenters approached to arrange the sacred sake and offerings, musicians played music as usual. I then made my customary pilgrimage from Sawada Shrine to Ōta Shrine before returning home. ○ Since today was an auspicious day, I instructed carpenter Zenbei to begin work on the storehouse site on the northwest side of the residence grounds, with Otoshirō assisting with rope-laying and rope-pulling, and arranged for Gensa to transport small stones and sand from the river plain around the four corner pillars. Since this was the first day, I offered celebratory sake.

19th Day, Tsuchinoto-U: Clear. I visited the residence of Naniwa Newly-appointed Third Rank Aikyō-kyō to congratulate him on his rank declaration, and sent fifteen rolls of cotton for small-sleeved garments. ○ I performed my regular duties in the lacquerware magistrate rotation as usual. ○ Regarding this storehouse construction...

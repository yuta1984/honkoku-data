This was the duty rotation. All matters were handled as usual.

13th day, Hinoto-Inu, clear: The representatives who departed for the capital to express gratitude for construction work to the Kanto region were: as deputy for Chief Priest Third Rank Mochihisa - Masamune Yamato-no-kami Takahisa, Councilor Bizen-no-kami Haruaki, and Toyofusa-sho representative Kataoka Hafuri Suo-no-kami Masahisa and others, who departed this morning. ○Since Tsuneki's serious illness shows no improvement, I requested seven days of prayers to Head Priest Shigekata starting today. Today I received the great purification wand.

○In the past, in Tenpo 3 (1832), 12th month, I purchased from Sannosuke Saburo his rice field cultivation rights at Mugime for five workers, with a yield of 6 to 5 sho, for gold in Sugi ryo. Furthermore, in the 7th month of this Hitsuji year (1835), I purchased his Mikusu field cultivation rights for six workers, with a yield of 3 to 5 sho, for 200 monme of silver. However, both of these properties were used by him as security for borrowed silver from the shrine's ten-day rotating credit association. When the association term ended, he fell behind in repayment, so in addition to those two secured properties, I newly purchased for 1 kan 200 mon of silver the cultivation rights for: Mikusu five-worker field yielding 5 to of rice, Mugime six-worker field yielding 3 to 5 sho, Chakibara planted field yielding 2 to 5 sho, and the previously mentioned Mikusu six-worker field with yield increased from 3 to 5 sho to 4 to. This was paid to Sado-no-kami Tsunemasu who handled the association matters. I received deeds for a total of five properties from him. However, the deeds for the Mugime five-worker and Mikusu six-worker fields had already been transferred to us, and there were discrepancies about which deeds were which, so this time they were made void. This is extremely improper behavior.

Furthermore, from Kyuemon of Hiiragi-hara Tsu Kuni-machi, in the 2nd month of last Uma year (1834), I purchased his rice fields called Maeda-oka-en, 1 tan 3 se planted yielding 1 koku 1 to for 1 kan 200 monme of silver, and Mame 8 se with yield of 4 to for 420 monme of silver. This was also used as security for the same association's borrowed silver, and when repayment similarly fell behind, I newly purchased for 460 monme of silver his residential field property of 2 tan with cultivation rights yielding 4 to 6 sho, paid this to the same association handler Tsunemasu, and received the deeds for the aforementioned Maeda and Mame properties from him.

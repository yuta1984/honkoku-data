I descended from the rear gate, and as the weather cleared, I made pilgrimages to Okadera, Tachibana-dera, and Asukagai Shrine. Inside Asukagai Shrine is the Outer Ise Shrine. I had lunch at the same place, and in the evening returned to Chikashō to stay. Today, during my absence, for the first time officials from the encampment - Nakagawa Shichizaemon and Tsujimoto Ichizō - came, and Yūzaemon conducted thorough negotiations regarding the matter of silver payment for rice certificates at Nishitsuji. I had written the gist of this negotiation two days ago and given it to him.

24th day, Tsuchinoe-saru, clear. In the afternoon I sent Yūzaemon to the encampment to urge a response. Stayed at the same place.

25th day, Tsuchinoto-tori, clear. The encampment officials Nakagawa and Tsujimoto came in the morning to discuss considerably reducing the silver payment for rice certificates to one hundred kan in securities and annual installment arrangements. They discussed the matter of official silver certificates and said they would return after consulting with everyone. Stayed at the same place.

26th day, Kanoe-inu, clear. At the hour of the horse (11 AM-1 PM), Nakagawa and Tsujimoto came to discuss the certificates for the honorific title, various documents, and receipts, but the annual installment plan for one hundred kan-monme fell through. Stayed at the same place.

27th day, Kanoto-i, clear. From early morning Nakagawa and Tsujimoto came and gradually negotiated the matter, requesting standard certificates. Since Sakai and relatives Shōshichi and Kahei also made requests, after bilateral negotiations this matter was resolved. Officials from Lord Mizuno Iwami-no-kami's domain villages signed and registered about two thousand koku of rice, and furthermore the Nishitsuji encampment officials Nakagawa and Tsujimoto both applied supplementary document seals and agreed. Stayed at the same place today too.

28th day, Mizunoe-ne, rain. From Nishitsuji came word that since the rice certificate documents were completed and rice was registered, they would withdraw two hundred kan of rice certificates at a time, so I replied that I understood. I sent word that receipt documents should be submitted. At the early part of the hour of the snake (9-11 AM), I left behind Yūzaemon, relative Shōshichi, and one servant, instructing them to receive the documents and return once the signing of both certificates was completed today. I took along colleague Hikobei, one servant, and relative Kahei and departed Chikashō to make a pilgrimage to Taima-dera (the historic site of Princess Chūjō). Had lunch in front of Taima-dera, then viewed the Tatsuta River, made pilgrimages to Tatsuta Shrine and then Hōritsu-ji Temple. The sun set at Kōriyama, and from there I traveled three ri to return to Kizu gate, arriving at Umihiko-ya Shōshichi's place around the early part of the hour of the boar (9-11 PM).

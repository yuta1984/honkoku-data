Shrine parishioners who came to worship at will took seats in the sacred mat hall, gathering together. The carpenters sat on long benches facing north on the west side of the front courtyard of the sacred mat hall, with one swordsmith seated next to them. However, the head carpenter wore the court dress of Fourth Rank, the assistant head carpenter wore court dress, two assistant master carpenters wore hunting robes, three foremen wore formal crested robes, and two others served as attendants wearing brown hunting robes and hakama, carrying quivers at their waist and bows in front, black lacquered swords, while junior attendants wore white court dress with hakama. Soon the Western Magistrate Lord Matsudaira Ise-no-kami, along with Nakai Mizu-no-kami, Edo officials, shrine repair officials, yoriki assistants, dōshin officers, master carpenters and others each came forward. Their attire consisted of court caps and hemp formal dress, with all the warrior class officials arriving at the naorai hall.

At that time, to begin the ceremony, first two master carpenters ascended the main ridge and sat beside the arrows (facing east), next two attendants sat near the main eaves (facing east), then the assistant head carpenter carried a sake vessel (which was in the ritual box) and ascended to place it in the center of the main ridge. Sacred sake was carried by foremen wearing formal crested robes, then two foremen sat east and west in the small courtyard, next the head carpenter advanced to the center of the small courtyard to present sacred offerings, while junior attendants transmitted the offerings. These offerings had been placed on the veranda of the ritual recitation hall beforehand as usual. The head carpenter presented the offerings and bowed three times - right, left, right. With each bow, the foremen in the small courtyard chanted "Chitose" and "Tō" in loud voices while striking hammers. At this time, the two master carpenters on the main ridge also struck hammers in unison three times in the same manner. When finished, the carpenters scattered about three hundred small rice cakes from the main ridge.

After this was completed, the warrior officials withdrew, and at that time the head priest and others departed. At this moment, the head carpenter took the cotton net that was tied to the pillar of the sacred mat hall and handed it to the head priest, who took it and cut it. Next, the senior negi priest and senior hafuri priest did likewise, and all shrine officials from assistant negi priests downward each took their own portion. After this concluded, they dispersed. The parishioners had a sacred feast at the sacred mat hall, but as I had duties at the palace, I departed first. Light rain was falling, and I arrived at Ōta Shrine and completed worship there as usual.

The lacquer work magistrate was scheduled for yesterday the 20th, but it was completed and stopped on the 16th. However, there was no word from any quarter, as usual.

22nd Day, Kanoto-I: Clear. I sent one barrel of sake (two shō) as a gift to Lord Irie Tosa-no-kami's residence. Ōi delivered it. The regular palace gold-contribution lecture was held at Yoshidaya as usual; I attended and returned home at the Hour of the Dog.

On the 8th of this month, regarding a famous tea ceremony water jar from Seo Jihei's household, I was asked by Yahei's younger brother and manager Nakasuke of the same family to borrow and exchange 150 ryō in gold, and today one hundred ryō of that amount...

Upon completion of the above matters, it was decided today that they should be carried out as in previous years.

Twenty-sixth day, Kinoto-i, clear. Regarding Horikawa Omi-no-kami, despite being ill, he failed to manage household affairs properly, which displeased the authorities, and he was ordered to refrain from duties. Later, Hoju Koin was also similarly ordered into house confinement, and all from the inner quarters downward were restricted from coming and going. Due to incidents such as Shimohashi Yamato-no-suke's failure to appear, he was also ordered to refrain from duties. His son Saemon was to receive the same order, but due to his young age, he was pardoned and allowed to continue his service as before. These orders were conveyed to Horikawa Saemon-no-shi.

Twenty-seventh day, Hinoe-ne, rain. Regarding the annual dengaku performance arranged by blind musicians from the Ujiso office, this year since the usual person was on leave, it was arranged through his grandson's household, Seiya-tei. There had been prior notice that I should participate as a dancer, so I requested Sei-kata to serve as my substitute and received his consent. ○ Concerning the fields belonging to the late Yamato-no-suke Toshitane, the tenant farmer Sanjuro of the Kesen subordinate lands failed to pay his dues entirely. At the request of Toshitane's widow and relatives, I was summoned by the shrine officials in the evening. In the presence of the monthly duty officers, I was told to guarantee that such complete non-payment would not be reported to the shrine officials. I respectfully acknowledged this and returned. ○ The small folded papers for the coming spring calendar for both Toshiaki and Kesen were submitted today to the Shoshi Daibu residence, carried by Keikei. ○ Regarding Urano Taian's son Kotaro's succession to the Horikawa house, in appreciation for the various assistance provided both internally and externally, 2,000 hiki in gold was sent as greeting. The remaining miscellaneous expenses and personal funds amounting to over 2 ryo were distributed by chamberlains Sasaki and Murata on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month.

Twenty-eighth day, Hinoto-ushi. I visited the household of the late Toshitane and informed his widow about guaranteeing Sanjuro's complete non-payment, stating that this matter would likely come up in next spring's investigation. She acknowledged this and said she would inform the relatives. ○ Regarding Seo Jihei's household, there had been discussions recently about over 100 ryo in gold granted from the domain authorities, which was recently distributed and received. In celebration, Chiyozo sent 1,000 hiki in gold, which I gratefully received. Although I initially declined repeatedly due to the current circumstances of that household, since this was a congratulatory matter and specifically discussed between Yahei's household master and retainer, I was told to accept it as is. Therefore, I accepted it. ○ Regarding the upper section of Hiiraihara, Machi Matsusuke

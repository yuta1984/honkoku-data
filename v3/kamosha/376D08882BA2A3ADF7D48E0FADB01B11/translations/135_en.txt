had fallen, with only about one ken (6 feet) remaining at the base—a truly regrettable thing. Also, when viewing the area around Asahiyama from across the river, there was a place in the river called "floating island" where a five-story stone pagoda had naturally emerged from the riverbed in recent years and now lay scattered about—a most unusual sight. After this, we had tea and rice at the Hoshino house, put on formal hemp kamishimo, and went to pay respects at the residence of Hoshino relative Kambayashi San'nyū. We met with San'nyū, his wife, children, and others. Next we went to Sano Dōi's residence. This person is a Hoshino relative and the elder brother of Seo Yahē. Since there was to be a family gathering at the Seo residence this evening, Dōi had also come up to Kyoto early this morning, so we met with his family. Next we went to Hoshino Munechū's residence—he is Shūi's uncle. We met with both husband and wife. Next we went to Nagai Sadamo's residence, where we also met with the couple and younger brother. Sadamo's wife is Shūi's sister. At each place, tea and sweets were served. We returned to the Hoshino house and after changing clothes, more food was served: simmered dishes of matsutake mushrooms and tofu, grilled dishes of salted steamed pike conger, sake, soup with lily bulbs, steamed sea cucumber as side dish, and a large dish of grilled Ray's bream with matsutake. After several cups, we departed. Jukōin accompanied us, while Misa, O, and Chiyozō went without palanquins, with three porters arranged by Hoshino. We boarded a boat from Uji Bridge—this boat was also provided by Hoshino's hospitality. The time was around the hour of the Horse. Today from Hoshino, celebratory money of one shu for Kahē was wrapped in half-paper, and 300 mon each for Kameshirō, Bunsuke, Uno and others, wrapped in half-paper respectively. We held a sake offering at Inari Tamaya, and after about half an hour returned to the Horikawa house. We gave one shu as drinking money to the three Uji porters and had them return directly to their village. Yasuko, Kyōki, Chiyozō and others immediately returned to Kamo and went home.

At the Seo Yahē residence, the daughter of Shimogamo Tanaka had quietly completed her wedding ceremony last night, and there was to be a family celebration with cups this evening, as had been mentioned beforehand. Therefore, I put on formal hemp kamishimo, took along my attendant Bunsuke, and went to the Seo residence in the evening. Soon after everyone had gradually assembled, we were guided to the reception room. I met the bride for the first time and offered congratulations. I also met Yahē's elder brother Sano Eneki for the first time and exchanged greetings. After being shown to the reception room, I met for the first time the retainers of Minamikōji Tōtōmi-no-kami: Tanaka Senshū, his grandson Kumawaka, Tanaka's son, and three women including his wife's women, and we exchanged greetings with each other. Soon everyone took their seats. First was Sasaki Kuwa.

Yesterday on the 23rd day at the hour of Saru (around 3-5 PM), Yahei's treatment was unsuccessful and he passed away. This is infinitely regrettable. I immediately visited to offer condolences to his son and the entire household. However, since his son Mashirō's petition for succession to the Tōdō estate has not yet been completed, it cannot be announced publicly, so a secret funeral will be held privately at the temple tonight. ○ Regarding the great fire in Osaka, a messenger was sent from the palace to inquire of Kida Shōzaemon. Tsujihana Zenbei, representing his colleagues, was sent with Kyūsuke as an attendant. They were given one bolt of habutae silk, and each of the two clerks was given 200 hiki of gold to take with them. They were sent down by boat on the night of the 21st and returned to Kyoto yesterday evening. Tetsuya Shōzaemon and his retainers were completely burned out, but fortunately none were injured. ○ The Osaka fire was caused by Ōshio Heihachirō's faction, and about one hundred of them have fortified themselves at Myōken-zan in Tanba Nose. Consequently, yesterday on the 23rd, Eastern Town Magistrate Sahashi Nagato-no-kami led his yoriki and dōshin to investigate and suppress them. Each carried full armor and military equipment.

25th day, 癸酉, Clear - I visited Seo Mashirō's residence and sent 100 hiki of gold as incense money (funeral offering). ○ I made a pilgrimage to Ono Sacred Shrine. ○ Regarding the succession of Horikawa Saemon Shihiromi, of the total 900 ryō that Urano Taian was to pay, 300 ryō was paid on December 23rd of last year, and the remaining 600 ryō was paid today. However, after accounting for interest on the 8 kan monme house mortgage and other calculations, 586 ryō, 1 bu, and 2 shu in cash was brought. This was immediately handed over to Aima Ichirō, Shinkyū Ryōtei's representative and relative, with both Murata and myself present as witnesses. Signed documents and receipts from both Shinkyū and Aima were presented by Aima, and these were immediately handed over by Murata to Yamamoto Masanosuke, younger brother and representative of Urano Taian, completing this matter.

26th day, 甲戌, Cloudy - Keikan, who had been confined due to syphilis for some days, has fully recovered and returned to service, so he came to visit. He brought the following list of names of those involved in the Osaka fire incident for review:
Suita Kannushi (Shinto priest)
Miyane Shima-no-kami

However, even by late December of last year (Year of the Horse), the money was not returned, and after repeated demands, finally on the 8th day of the 2nd month an advance payment of 1 ryō 2 bu was submitted. Since the remaining 2 ryō 2 bu and additional fees from the planting month to the 7th month of the previous year still had not been paid, we continued negotiations. With the agreement of the principal and all relatives, this was now rewritten as a permanent transfer deed for 286 momme 8 bu 2 rin of silver, and this evening the seals of Sanshirō and relatives Yajirō, Gensuke and others were obtained, completing one tsubo of the matter. However, of the 1 ryō 2 bu 9 rin submitted in the 2nd month, 1 bu was given to Kameshirō as compensation for his trouble, and the remaining 1 ryō 1 bu was placed in our custody at Yajirō's request.

The historians and below took their seats, and instructions were given for extinguishing the lantern stands in front of the curtained enclosure in the same manner. These lantern stands were jointly operated by attendants for extinguishing lights. Next, instructions were passed along to extinguish the tall lanterns and box lanterns at the location secured by the deputy and his associates in front of the Chinese gate. Then, still attending at the Palace Sewing Office's small courtyard, after completing the sacred relocation and when lighting the courtyard braziers, following the same procedure as before, according to the transmission from Deputy Chief Priest Yasutora, fires were immediately transferred to hand lanterns at the shrine head, and instructions were passed to each of the aforementioned locations to transfer and assist with the fires. Particularly today, the box lanterns and tall lanterns needed by the head magistrates were provided by the shrine and used from those at the bathhouse. Next, among the head magistrates, those assigned such as Seiki and Kyōi helped remove the white curtains from the main shrine's temporary hall and spread them out. At this time, small swords were removed and placed in the lavatory. Next, the head priest performed the offering ceremony at the main shrine's small courtyard. Prior to this, one person named Sadauemon from among the sword bearers was called and stationed beside the western offering hall. When Deputy Chief Priest Yasutora rose from his seat, I took the offerings from the shelf at the western offering hall, had sword bearer Sadauemon carry them, and had them passed to Deputy Chief Priest Yasutora from ground level near the sliding boards on the west side of the temporary hall. From around mid-morning today, Kyōki and Kyōkei came to worship at will, remained at the shrine head, and prostrated themselves on the ground in front of the feast hall during the relocation ceremony. Imperial Messenger Lord Shimizudani and others departed from this location around the hour of the Boar (around 10 PM). All matters proceeded without delay, and Keisen returned home around the hour of the Rat (around midnight) after deliberating with those stationed at the bathhouse and reporting the withdrawal to the shrine staff and others.

17th Day, Hinoe-Ne: Clear. Due to the western middle accounting office construction work, this year's [ceremony] was postponed, but today proceeded as usual with an early morning notification. For Kyōki's first participation, early in the morning I sent a tobacco pipe on a stand with a tag reading "Palace Head Cook" to the head annual official's residence. I assembled at the usual time for the calculation ceremony. Treasury Magistrate Lord Sueshi Hikoto retired from service, and Suenobu and Kyōi were entrusted with joint responsibility. When the annual official head gave notice regarding Kyōki, participants assembled wearing hemp formal dress. Those participating were Hissanao, Kyōki, and Tomonao; the rest did not attend. As usual, the purification leaders took their seats in the next position, and when the ■tai purification bath was conducted, the first-time participants [entered] the bath.

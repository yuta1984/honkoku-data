According to the shrine records, on the night of the 25th day of the 8th month of Eishō 3 (1048), Chief Priest Chikatsune and Assistant Ritualist Motonobu of the Hafuribe clan, along with Assistant Priest Shige, killed Shrine Master Narizane in front of the new shrine at Kifune Shrine and were sentenced to exile. From this time, the Hafuribe clan was permanently abolished.

Personal observation: From Motonobu's exile in Eishō 3 to Nariyori's death in Hōan 2 was 74 years. While the genealogy records that Motonobu and Nariyori served as ritualists, Narisue was Narishi's uncle and Narichō was Nariyori's elder brother. Considering this, it's possible that Narisue and Narichō served as ritualists between Motonobu and Nariyori. The genealogy states they changed to the Kamo surname based on Yasuyori's recommendation, but the subsequent record is unclear and requires investigation.

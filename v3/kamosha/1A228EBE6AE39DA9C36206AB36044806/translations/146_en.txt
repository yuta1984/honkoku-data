Note on attached paper:
Regarding the daily records of the Three Groups, since Genroku 3 (1690), the head officials of the East and West groups have been responsible for custody and recording. However, in Hōreki 3 (1753), after deliberation by the assembly members and consultation within the seats of the Three Groups, it was decided that Bingo-no-kami Yasukiyo would handle the Eastern group, and Sakon-shōgen concurrent Ō-uneme Naoya would handle the West-Central group.

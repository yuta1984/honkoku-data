○《Side note: Gunki Ruikan, second line》June Purification, Arawa Purification, Nagoshi Purification
Looking at the norito (Shinto prayers) for the last day of June recorded in Engishiki Book 8, they are largely the same as what is now called Nakatomi Purification in the houses of Urabe Shinto, with only minor differences in the opening and closing words.
Regarding the question of when to perform purification if there is an intercalary month in June, it is recorded in the Azuma Kagami that it should be performed in the latter sixth month.

○Sarugaku (Noh Theater) In Gunki Ruikan:
At this shrine, since ancient times, during reconstruction periods, there have been dengaku (field music) and ennen-mai (longevity dances) as celebratory ceremonies. During the Koji, Tensho, and Kan'ei periods, there were Noh performances. During the Enpo period, there was no such arrangement, but there were performances during the Shotoku period.
《Side note: Uji no Ki》Regarding the reconstruction of our shrine in Kan'ei 5 (1628), the Uji no Ki states: "On December 26th, celebratory Noh performances for the shrine transfer ceremony were held on the lawn south of the office building. Although in ancient times there were dengaku and ennen-mai dances, this time, following the precedent of the Koji and Tensho periods, the shrine's music director Yada Magoemon-no-jo performed them."

Upon completion of the above, each changed into formal dress.

Next we went to the inner quarters to announce this news to the senior ladies and lady attendants, then made announcements at each of the outer office locations. Next, the entire group of close attendants similarly expressed their gratitude. As for Ijichi, following previous custom as head of close attendants, he went transparently to the storehouse to express his gratitude. Regarding provisioning staff Shōzaburō, at the accounting office, the three stewards Sasaki, Murata and myself met to issue his appointment and handed over the written order. Afterwards, in the afternoon, we made courtesy calls to the various dabu, samurai, and both heads of close attendants, bringing name cards as follows. Furthermore, regarding Sasaki Dazai-daikan, due to his various prior services, I privately sent him 100 hiki in gold as a separate gift of modest refreshment money via an attendant.

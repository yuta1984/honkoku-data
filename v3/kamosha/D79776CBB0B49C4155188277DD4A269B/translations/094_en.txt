Four zōshiki (two senior officials in withered-leaf colored upper garments, two junior officials in formal attire), one細立 child attendant (wearing light-colored garments, in ritual abstinence), umbrella bearer, shoe bearer, and four hakuchō (white-robed attendants) carrying ritual objects, along with a folding chair. Around the hour of the Dog (7-9 PM), Imperial Messenger Takamatsu-dono and others visited our shrine. The dancers were Hirohashi-dono, Hachijō-dono, Yanagiwara-dono, and Kageyu-kōji-dono. The accompanying attendants were Nitta-dono, Gotsuji-dono, Maki, and Fujiki. The treasurer was Naga-Abe, along with other ceremonial attendants. I returned from Tsunehiro's place after the hour of the Monkey (3-5 PM), remained at the samurai office, and finished after the hour of the Boar (9-11 PM). The court liaison Hirohashi-dono and others departed directly from the shrine grounds without rest. Tsunehiro performed his duties without incident, which was truly commendable.

28th day, Kanoto-u (Metal Rabbit) - Light rain
Today, His Excellency the Sadaijin sent betrothal gifts to Lady Kame-kimi: one御褂 (formal robe) of red cloud and rising wave brocade, one浜打衣 robe, one light green unlined robe, one formal hakama, a hinoki fan, Matsushige formal wear, a lacquered obi with gold decoration featuring trailing pine and tortoiseshell patterns with gold leaf, and various other gifts from different parties. Messenger Takahashi had an audience. For the celebration, three officials dressed formally, with Dainagon Irie wearing fifth-rank light-colored sashinuki, while others wore noshime hemp formal wear, expressing joy and receiving celebratory sake. Irie served as messenger for the return courtesy from the Dainagon. Last night there was flooding.

12th Month (Long Month)

1st day, Mizunoto-mi (Water Snake) - Rain turning to snow
Went to the Satsuma residence to inquire about Chiyozō's distant journey, returning home by palanquin at the hour of the Snake (9-11 AM). Harima-no-kami Hiroshi had been ill for some time, but treatment was unsuccessful and he passed away yesterday, the 29th. He was retrieved from the Kyoto outpost office yesterday evening. He was seventy-seven years old at the time. In the afternoon, I brought two shō of sake for condolences. The funeral is tonight.

2nd day, Kinoe-uma (Wood Horse) - Clear
Today the era name change was decided. This is due to the burning of the main keep of Edo Castle in the fifth month of this year. Perhaps this follows precedent. The participating officials were Tsuneki and Tsuneaki as attendants. Though difficult to state clearly, the following was decided: designated as Kōka 1st year.

Kaei (Nan'gon-chi-kyō, Jin'ari-chō-kyō), Kaen (Nan'ari-chō-kyō, Chin-ki-kō 2, 3 Ki-kō, Tsūri-kyō), Bunkyū (Nan-ki-kō, Chin-gon-chi-kyō, Tadayoshi-asomi)

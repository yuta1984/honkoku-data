Upon request, permission was granted, and in total six new members joined, each contributing 200 hiki of gold, and of course joining the association as well. The winning bid went to Kei-ryo's place, though there was discussion about Kei-shu's financial difficulties. However, the association's method is that only the contribution money is bid at each meeting for ten years and six months, and the remaining members also divide the money based only on their contributions. The evening session concluded and everyone dispersed. The remaining silver will be managed entirely by lending arrangements among the organizers, and all inter-member lending is suspended.

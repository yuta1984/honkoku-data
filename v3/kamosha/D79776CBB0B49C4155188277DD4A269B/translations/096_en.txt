Before the hour of the Monkey, Lady Kame-kimi entered her palanquin to go to Takatsukasa-dono. For this occasion, the mother figure in the sleeping quarters lowered the hanging blinds, set up two standing curtain frames on the wooden flooring of the eaves area, and in the northern section arranged one mat with colored stripes, money-shaped screens, and low tables arranged around as the princess's seat. In the nobles' area, one mat for the host's seat and two mats for earthen floor seating were arranged. Hanging blinds were set up, thin mats were spread on both sides of the palace floor, and based on the raised platform, Chinese chests, painted scrolls, document cases, writing sticks, and other items were arranged. Before the appointed time, the accompanying court nobles, Middle Captain Nakayama-dono, Minor Controller of the Crown Prince's Household Ikejiri-dono, and the advance guards Takahashi, Yasuda, Irie, Namba and others took their seats. The princess took her seat behind hanging blinds, Kōtokui came to the eaves area to perform the cup offering ceremony, then moved to the southern corner of the sleeping quarters. The princess boarded the decorated palanquin, then the departure carriage was brought to the wickerwork area, and the front middle section of the middle gate corridor belonged to the same mansion's inner quarters.

Therefore, in the evening, I went privately within the family circle to offer condolences and sent one hundred pieces of gold as incense money, completing the ceremonial bow. However, it was reported that permission for Jibu-kyō's petition for family headship had been granted by the Kantō authorities.

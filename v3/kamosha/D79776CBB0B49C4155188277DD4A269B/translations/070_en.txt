(Annotation: This time appointed to samurai rank as accounting head, gratefully offering thanks for this honor) Kondō Oribe
However, this is recorded as an announcement to both heads of close attendants.

Having completed the above, I returned home in the evening and made the announcement to my household. However, today only Ōi-no-kami and others offered their thanks in regular clothing.

17th day, kinoto-u, clear weather - This is Setsubun (seasonal division). My elderly mother reached the age of 83, most auspicious and precious indeed. I celebrated my age of 58 at the palace. The celebratory arrangements were as usual. ○ Regarding this appointment to samurai rank within the house, concerning Yasuko's formal visit of thanks to the palace, since there are no remaining days left in the year, it was ordered today through steward Sasaki that the family thanks visit by the tayu samurai household should be set for the 5th day of the coming New Year as an auspicious occasion. I humbly appeared before His Lordship to accept this order and express my gratitude.

22nd day, kanoe-saru, clear weather - Following annual custom for the late Ujisō's memorial, blind musicians performed gagaku court music in the intermediate hall, to be presented today and tomorrow at Uji Palace, with ritual prayer reciters to attend both days as previously announced. However, due to the busy period of house affairs, tonight I attended directly, tomorrow evening Tsunaki will serve as substitute, and I entrusted the matter of prayer reciters to others through Hyōdono. In the evening, I visited the shrine where gagaku and prayer reciters performed their duties as usual.

23rd day, kanoto-tori, clear weather with occasional snow - Tsunaki served as substitute for the gagaku performance.

25th day, mizunoto-i, clear weather - This season's total expenditures amount to approximately 877 monme, 6 bu, 7 rin, 5 mō in silver.

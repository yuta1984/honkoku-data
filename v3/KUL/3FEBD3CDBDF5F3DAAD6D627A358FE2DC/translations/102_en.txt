Records of Drifting at Sea, Volume Three
The dry season has arrived and the weather is clear with bright, crisp air. For the first time, we make preparations for setting sail.
We spend two or three days carrying various necessary implements into the boat. We also dig a long ditch to
draw water and make it easier for the boat to float. ○ One morning, I have Furin
go to the beach to catch a turtle. The meat of one turtle can
sustain us for seven days of meals, and moreover it tastes delicious. Furin returns after a short while and suddenly
climbs over the wall like a cat. He urgently calls me and announces that danger is approaching, saying, "I saw
five or six boats coming near the island." I quickly look carefully and see that it is not five or six boats but
only two or three. I said, "Do not fear. We shall kill them all. If they are
evil men, they will surely eat us. It is better that we kill them. Can you fight?"

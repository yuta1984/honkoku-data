Under the law, it goes without saying that these men would face the death penalty. They bound and captured them all. ◯ Those guilty of serious crimes were placed in underground cells, while the others were imprisoned in the fortress. Fusuzu was stationed at the entrance of the underground prison to stand guard. ◯ That night, we entertained our companions and also discussed tomorrow's battle. ◯ Early in the morning, the captain summoned all the surrendered men and said, "Although this island is small, because heaven's assistance is abundant, there are people living here, and there is also an island king. Henceforth, those who break the law shall be punished." He also said, "Will you follow me and fight well or not?" The prisoners all prostrated themselves and said, "We respectfully obey your honored commands," and through various tests, their sincerity was thoroughly understood. They also swore, saying, "We shall follow and respect our lord as we would our parents. If there are any among us who do not act according to my words, let them cut off their own heads and offer their lord a sacrifice with a single drop of blood from their necks." Thereupon, he also commanded the prisoners to have an audience with the island king, Robinson, and instructed them to return to the righteous path. ◯

I arranged all the surrendered soldiers in formation on the beach:
The first group of two surrendered soldiers were those captured initially
The second group of two surrendered soldiers were those imprisoned in the fortress and pardoned by the captain
The third group of five surrendered soldiers were those imprisoned in the underground cells

I determined a plan to seize the main ship. First, we filled the large hole in the small boat, made the sailor the commander, and had four surrendered soldiers follow him. One small boat had the captain as commander with five surrendered soldiers following and the helmsman as subordinate. All went out to the seashore and awaited my command. At midnight, I issued orders in a loud voice, saying, "The time has come! Row secretly, attach to both sides of the main ship, and board simultaneously!" Everyone heard the command and departed immediately. ◯ The captain and sailor's two boats advanced together, leaped aboard the ship, and immediately struck down two [men] on the deck with the wooden stocks of their guns.

Robinson and Fusuzu remained on the island to guard the remaining prisoners and observe the progress of the battle.

The ship was half buried. All the sailors said, "There is no way to make this ship float on the water surface again. If we want to extend our lives after encountering this wind and waves, fortunately we still have one small boat tied up. Let us board it to avoid the wind." However, that boat already had many leaks and could not be boarded. There was another small boat, but it was inside the ship and difficult to lower to the water surface. The ship was in a state where it was about to break apart. We eleven people finally threw the small boat into the seawater and boarded it to drift, but since it was a small boat, we definitely could not avoid (the waves).

When I finally raised my head above water and looked toward the shore, it was quite near. When I tried to swim quickly to reach the shore, again from behind came raging waves like high mountains, chasing me just as a strong enemy chases defeated soldiers. When I felt I was two or three fathoms underwater, enveloped by these waves, the wave's force threw me toward the shore with swift and fierce momentum. I also tried to breathe and exhausted all means to float and swim, and fortunately my head emerged above water, and I could breathe a little

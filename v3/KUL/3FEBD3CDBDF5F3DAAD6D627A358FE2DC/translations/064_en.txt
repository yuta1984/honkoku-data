I thought that if I kneaded the soil and dried it under the blazing sun, it would serve the purpose fairly well, so I made two or three small jars from a lump of earth. Intending to use these as substitutes for buckets, I dried them in the sun and tested them, but when dried they all cracked like tortoise shells. I reconsidered and dried them in the shade, and finally they dried hard. Also, since it was difficult to form shapes without mixing in clay, I searched everywhere for clay for a long time. Finally obtaining some, I labored greatly to carry it home, remade them several times, and finally completed two small jars. When these jars dried well and hardened, I made baskets from soft, thin, weak branches and wrapped them from the outside to prevent cracking, filling the gaps with straw to prevent them from rolling around. For the first time I put wheat flour in them to protect against humidity. ○After obtaining clay, I made large jars. I also created flat ones, round ones, and others, and when dried in the sun they became extremely hard

and could be put to use. However, large jars were difficult to make. ○All the jars mentioned above cannot be put over fire, nor can they hold liquids. I tried to devise further ingenuity to create something that could withstand water and liquids. ○One day, when I was roasting meat over a fierce fire and extinguished the flames, I happened to find a piece of burnt earth among the ashes. Looking closely, it was a fragment of the clay I had used to make jars. Burnt by fire, it was as hard as magnetite, and its color was pure red like blood. I thought that when this clay is fired, it must become this hard. Therefore I wanted to fire the jars, but I knew nothing of potters' kilns, nor did I know how to refine glazes, though I had heard that lead could be used as a substitute for glaze. ○I have much lead in my stores. Therefore I molded three large jars, making their shape like urns. On their outer surface

From the 1st to the 4th month, heavy rains continued for approximately 56 days. Building that hut involved countless hardships, but even if I described them in detail, people would not believe it. ○ Among the mountain trees there are birds like doves. I picked up their chicks, brought them back, and raised them to breed as a source of food. Searching the mountains for feed for these birds is extremely laborious. This is because I fear that if feed becomes scarce, they will flee back to the mountains. The taste of these birds resembles that of pheasant. ○ When making a bucket, I somehow managed the hoops through ingenuity, but when it came to making the bottom, I was greatly troubled. Finally, through innovation, I also completed the bottom. However, there are gaps and it cannot hold water. ○ For lighting the night, I exhausted the white wax I had stored in advance.

When I first sowed them, they all rotted and I obtained not a single grain. This was because it was not the proper season for sowing seeds. Therefore, I select suitable land for sowing.

I constructed and waited. Every morning I went to check, but I saw not a single sheep - they had all broken through. ○One morning when I went to look, there were three sheep inside, and separately there was an extremely large old sheep. ○I had once heard that even fierce beasts, when hungry, can be well tamed by humans. So I drove the sheep and threw them all into the pitfall, giving them no food for three days, then gradually gave them food to tame them. Finally I led them home and raised them. In this way I obtained many sheep, and my livestock became quite numerous. I also sought good pastureland, made fences with trees on all four sides to prevent their escape, and made them multiply greatly. ○On the western side of this island, three clear springs flow and there is a place suitable for pasture.

When the sheep in the enclosure were not yet tamed, I tied all their feet with short ropes, and in the evening untied the ropes and gave them food.

I came to make dozens of divided enclosures. In each enclosure I would place two or three males and females each. ○I obtained sheep's milk, up to eight or nine pints per day. However, this was not enough to make cheese. ○The meat for my lifetime was sufficient with this, and I greatly felt how providence benefits mankind. ○I am truly the sovereign of this island. Why? Because I catch sheep from the enclosures and slaughter them to serve at my table. My only friend is one parrot that constantly attends me, an old dog is at my right side, and two cats are under my desk. Their salary is waiting for me to throw them a small piece of meat. ○This

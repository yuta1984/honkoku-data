It hung downward about five or six shaku, and finally he leaped down to the ground. The bear still tried to pursue him, coming down gradually with its hind legs first. Its descent was like a person climbing down a ladder, head up and legs down, so it was very slow. Finally, when it was just one step from reaching the ground, [Fusuzu] inserted the gun barrel into the bear's ear and pulled the trigger. Having killed the bear, he turned to me and said, "How was my technique?" I said, "It was truly remarkable. Do you employ this technique in your homeland as well?" He answered, "Yes."

One is a plain surrounded by dense forest on the forward path—specifically, the entrance where one passes through that plain and attempts to enter the dense forest is an extremely narrow place. The other is within that forest." Two koku before nightfall, we penetrated the first forest. After another two or three koku, we reached that plain. In the first forest, I merely saw five wolves running toward us, passing horizontally at a distance of four or five jō in front of me. Probably

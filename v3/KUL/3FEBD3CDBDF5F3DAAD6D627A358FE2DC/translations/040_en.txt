I found this strange, but upon careful consideration, it was all the doing of the earthquake. Broken planks from the wrecked ship drifted along with the advancing tide. I also went to that place and obtained numerous pieces of timber with the axe.

On the 3rd day, I dug out fragments of timber from the sand and cut them with a saw. When the tide came in, I stopped.

On the 4th day, I fished and caught one fish. From this time, I occasionally fished. When I caught many, I dried them in the sun and stored them. I wanted to catch a fish called "Dorhein" (the name of a large fish), but I lacked fishing equipment.

On the 5th day, I sawed three long planks from the wrecked ship and returned.

On the 6th day, I manufactured iron tools. This labor was even greater.

On the 7th day, the wrecked ship naturally broke apart due to water and sand, and inside the ship there was only water and sand.

On the 8th day, I carried an iron lever to the wrecked ship, broke it apart piece by piece, and transported them to land. I left the iron lever at this location.

On the 9th day, I broke open what had been pushed onto the sand by waves from the ship's bottom, and found several barrels inside, as well as lead ingots, which were extremely heavy.

From the 10th to the 14th day, I collected many wood fragments. I also obtained 300 kin of scrap iron.

On the 15th day, I went with both axes to retrieve those lead ingots. Since the lead ingots were in water about one shaku deep, I placed the blade of one axe on the lead and struck it with the back of the other axe to extract it.

On the 16th day, I caught dove chicks in the forest and returned. I intended to breed them to provide food. This night brought strong winds.

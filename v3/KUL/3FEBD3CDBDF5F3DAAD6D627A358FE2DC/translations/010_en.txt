I did not lose this resolve. The next day, the wind gradually became gentler and the waves also became somewhat calmer. However, I was still seasick from yesterday's great waves and could not yet get up. By evening the sea surface became calm, the setting sun was red, and the scenery evoked beauty. Again the next morning, the sea had not a single wave and was like a mirror, with the morning sunlight reflecting on the water and golden light sparkling brilliantly - the view was extremely good.

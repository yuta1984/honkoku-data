I asked whether the people of his country had ever fought and won battles, or whether their national power was weak. Friday answered, "The people of my country are brave and fierce, and when we fight we always win." I said, "Then why did you fall into enemy hands?" He answered, "When I fought the enemy, my unit was small and the enemy was numerous. They finally took us four as prisoners. However, in this battle we took three thousand enemies prisoner. If you compare this number to four, isn't this surely a victory for our forces?" I said, "That's right." I also wondered and asked, "When you were captured, why didn't your troops help you?" He answered, "The enemy captured me and sailed away quickly. Our army had no ships at that time." I said, "Did your soldiers return in triumph and send all three thousand prisoners back to their homeland to make peace, or did they eat them all?" He answered, "They all became food for our countrymen." I said, "Do you eat them in your country?" He answered, "We eat them in various places, but mostly we come to this island to eat them."

I said, "Have you also come here before?" He answered, "Yes, I have come here many times," and pointed to the northwest of the island. Based on this, I had him guide me to that place and went to see it. Since Friday had difficulty with language, using stones as counting tools, he indicated they had eaten twenty men, two women, and one child. I also asked, "When you come here, do you encounter typhoons and face danger?" He answered, "We calculate the tides when we come. We have never faced danger. If we go far out to sea in the morning or afternoon, there will surely be harm from typhoons." ○ Later I also asked Friday about this. This island is located at the mouth where the great river called "Orinoco" of "America" enters the sea. When the tide rises, seawater flows upstream into this river, and when the tide recedes, it flows out from this river again. This is an island on the north shore of that river mouth. ○ Also, what appears broadly from north to northwest is the large island called "Trinidad." ○ I asked him about various other things as well.

I checked on the scattered sheep, and on my way back when I came out to the beach, I saw twenty or thirty violent men in the distance and returned in shock. ○This was because I had gone to the forest enclosure to inspect the sheep, so I had not prepared much gunpowder and other supplies. Fortunately, I did not catch the attention of the violent men and was able to return secretly to the castle. From this point on, I prepared even more thoroughly for unexpected situations.

The two men, Yoto and the other, swore an oath by drinking blood. At this time, I lent each of the two men a gun and gave them gunpowder and lead bullets for eight shots, warning them not to use them unless it was a matter of life and death. I have already remained here for twenty-seven years, deeply contemplating emerging into the human world, and this action is sufficient to fulfill my long-held aspiration. At this time it was the full moon of the tenth month, and looking out from the beach, the moonlight glittered on the waves and the sea air penetrated to the bone. Eight days later, another strange event occurred. Early in the morning, while I was still fast asleep and had not yet risen, Furin suddenly woke me up, saying, "Ah, master, those sixteen men have already come aboard a large ship." I jumped up, hurriedly put on my clothes, and without even wearing weapons, calmly went out through the small gate, climbed the mountain behind, and looked out. I was greatly astonished. At a distance of more than half a ri from the beach, there was a small boat with triangular sails raised, and because the wind was strong and blowing toward our island, it would soon approach the island

and seemed destined to land not near our fortress but on the southern beach of the island. I commanded Furin, saying, "You must not utter a single word. They may be enemies." I immediately climbed the mountain and observed their movements through a telescope. When I finally reached the mountaintop, I was astonished again. About two ri to the southeast there was a large ship, and looking at its shape, sail markings, and the small boat, they were no different from those of our home country. Therefore I thought there must be people from our home country aboard, and perhaps fortunately there might be friends, so I greatly rejoiced and leaped about. My joyful heart seemed ready to ascend to heaven. At that moment, a doubt arose in my mind. Why would a ship from our home country come to this desolate island? Generally, ships from our home country trade in various directions, but they never come to this nearby region. This must be because they were set adrift by fierce winds. If so, they should come here to take on firewood and water, but instead of doing so, they are strolling along the seashore, which surely means that pirates have taken the ship

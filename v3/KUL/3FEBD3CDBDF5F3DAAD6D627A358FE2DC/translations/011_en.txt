The fear and hardship in this sea was nothing other than death itself. It was truly beyond what words can describe. At times the sea wind became ever swifter, and the sailors could not distinguish front from back. Though our ship was sturdy, because its cargo was heavy and it had been drifting long in the sea, the draft was severe. The sailors would sometimes climb up to the cabin and call out "Avoid the waves!" The lives of those on the ship were more precarious than morning dew, and their panic was beyond description.

When they finally came close, we tied a wooden float to a long rope from our ship and threw it far out. They pulled this rope to reach our ship. The people on the ship boarded it intending to land near "Winterton" (place name). After a while, when we looked back at the main ship, it had already sunk. Though the rushing waves were high, when we finally saw the shore, people had gathered in great numbers trying to rescue us. However, because the wind was fierce, we could not reach the shore quickly, and only gradually and barely reached the nearby "Cromer" region. This place was to the west and greatly

This was because he feared that if he let them escape, they would gather their comrades again and attack with many boats. ◯ As Furin was about to pursue them, getting into an abandoned boat, and I also entered another boat, there was separately one bound person in the boat.

When I asked him the reason, he did not answer, but merely opened his collar and thrust forward his face.

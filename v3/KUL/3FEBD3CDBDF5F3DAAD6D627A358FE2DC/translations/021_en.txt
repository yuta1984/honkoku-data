without seeing any. On the route sailing northeast toward the islands of "Fernando" and "Noronha," we saw various islands to the east. Finally, after twelve days, we reached a point seven degrees and twenty-two minutes north of the equator. At that time, a fearsome sea wind blew from the southeast toward the northwest. After a while, it began blowing northeast with great intensity. We floated and drifted in the ocean for twelve days, with the wind changing direction in all ways, just like a madman who cannot decide where to go. Truly, death seemed imminent, and those who valued their lives merely lay prostrate in the ship's hold, not daring to come out onto the deck. ○ Also around this time, we lost three crew members. Two of them died of fever, and one, being weak, drowned in the water. ○ After twelve days, the wind gradually became calm. Upon measuring our position, we found ourselves twelve degrees from the equator, twenty-two degrees west of "Augustine," near the northern border of "Brazil" where the "Amazon" River flows into the sea.

Traveling along this shore, we first intended to reach "Africa," but there was the danger of the "Mexican" Gulf. Therefore, we abandoned this plan. Before long, a great wind began to blow with increasing intensity. One person on the ship called out, saying "I can see land over there." I wanted to climb up to the ship's roof to verify this, but the ship was pitching so much that I could not stand on my feet. Moreover, I only feared that the ship might be broken by the waves, or strike a reef, or get stuck in shallow water—I feared only the destruction of the ship. ○ Finally we encountered shallow water and

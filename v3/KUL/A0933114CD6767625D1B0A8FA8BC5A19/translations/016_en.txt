　　We reported this matter here. On the 7th, [the ships] rowed into Shikanoshima.
1. Korean fishing vessels that had drifted in the Genkai Sea on the 28th of the 12th month of the previous year rowed into Karadomari, but due to bad weather they could not depart for Nagasaki and were delayed. Since Karadomari was not suitable as a mooring place, they rowed into Imatsu, but because of the location where they entered, the route to Nagasaki was poor, so on the 7th they rowed into Shikanoshima.
1. As mentioned above, both vessels rowed into Shikanoshima, so we discussed that it would be best to send them all together to Nagasaki. Kamata Hachirōbei was sent to Shikanoshima to take care of the ships. After informing everyone, on the 8th they departed from Shikanoshima. Since we are sending both vessels at once, we discussed that there is no need to provide special guards. The names of those who accompanied them and the ship formations are submitted in a separate document.

1. According to messages sent by courier from Hikita Yoemon, Furuta Heibei, and Yoshida Hachirōbei in Nagasaki, on the evening of the 10th both Korean ships arrived in Nagasaki without incident aboard, and when this was immediately reported to the magistrate's office, on the 12th inspectors were sent from both magistrate's offices, and the handover of both vessels was completed at Ōhato. The letter from Nagasaki is submitted herewith.
1. Heibei and Hachirōbei have not yet returned, but since there are no unusual matters, I will not make any special additional reports about their arrival.
1. Regarding this matter of the Korean ship drift, we promptly sent express messages to the senior retainers of both Nagasaki magistrate's offices, and we received letters from Lord Tōtōmi-no-kami and Lord Shimōsa-no-kami stating that they had been informed, and there was also a reply from Yoemon.

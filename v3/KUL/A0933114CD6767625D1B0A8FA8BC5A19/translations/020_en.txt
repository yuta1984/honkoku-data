Memorandum
1. On the 10th day of the 11th month of Genroku 5 (1692), when a Korean fishing vessel drifted ashore at Oshima, Takao Yagozaemon visited Lord Matsudaira Goroemon and reported the matter.
Regarding the lord being in Edo, we inquired whether we should report this to the Osaka castle authorities. When we stated that we would act according to instructions on this matter, we were told that there was no need to report to the castle authorities and that Goroemon would convey the message, so we did not visit anywhere.

1. In the first month of Genroku 8 (1695), when a Korean fishing vessel drifted ashore at Tsuyazaki Bay, Hami Koemon went to Lord Matsudaira Genba and reported with a written document.

At this time, from within the Genba-no-kami's office, we were instructed that there was no need to report to the castle authorities, so we did not go anywhere. This was a year when the lord was in residence in Edo.

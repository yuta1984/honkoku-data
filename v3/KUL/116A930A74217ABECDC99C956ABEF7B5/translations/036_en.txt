The sail shadows appeared as small as bamboo leaves, showing they were indeed withdrawing. Now, the three domains' liaison officers went to Lord Geki's lodgings early on the following 16th day, where they were received and told: "Last night all quarters worked together and drove off the Chinese ships, so they withdrew quickly. This is commendable. I will report this to Edo today." After this greeting and everyone's departure, he said to Kurushima Jihei: "Last night Chikuzen's gunners and naval forces showed exceptional dedication compared to other domains and performed admirably. This is truly befitting of your house's reputation." Afterward, the three domains also hastily sent reports to Edo, and from Chikuzen, Yamaji Yaemon (inspector) departed directly from Wakamatsu on the 16th. Also, on the night of the 17th, Lord Geki summoned the liaison officers of the three domains and announced: "Since the Chinese ships are no longer visible, all four domains should withdraw for now." Therefore, at the morning tide on the 18th, everyone returned to Wakamatsu.

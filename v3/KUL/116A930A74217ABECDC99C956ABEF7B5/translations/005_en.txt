In the presence of the monthly duty officer Lord Gun Heima and others, the following was announced: Due to Chinese ships drifting since last year, Inspector Watanabe Geki has now been dispatched as an envoy to the three domains, and orders have been given to carry out expulsions according to his directives.

With this understanding, they were ordered to proceed to Wakamatsu on the coming 28th day to demonstrate their commitment and carry out their duties. Lord Kasaku and various other officials were appointed to lead this effort.

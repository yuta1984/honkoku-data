　In deliberations about how often they would fire with loaded shot when repelling [the ships], it was decided they would fire with gunpowder only. The three men - Bun'emon, Yaemon, and Jintayū - were repeatedly instructed to discuss this matter thoroughly with their disciples and never to load shot. Furthermore, they were told to conceal ammunition boxes under the bamboo decking of their respective official vessels. This was as a precaution in case the Chinese ships offered resistance. Now, the gunpowder to be fired during the repulsion was to be placed in individual leather pouches (dōran) with attached tags and sent to Kuno Zen'emon's quarters. When firing at sea, they were instructed that Zen'emon would distribute the individual pouches from his vessel so each could load their gunpowder. Accordingly, they sent individual leather pouches containing only gunpowder with attached tags to Zen'emon's quarters in advance.

They boarded two cargo vessels《marginal note: Hōtoku-maru and Miyaichi-maru》 with five towing boats attached, departed Wakamatsu on February 13th, and headed for Kokura. With spring rain falling and wind rising, they moored in front of Nakanoshima island. Around 9 o'clock that same day, a letter arrived via messenger boat《marginal note: whale boat》 from Kitamura Yajibē and Kuno Zen'emon in Kokura to Hayashi Bun'emon, Wakamatsu Jintayū, and Usuki Yaemon. What Geki-dono asked Kurushima Jihē was whether the hired large cannon operators from Fukuoka had arrived at Kokura.

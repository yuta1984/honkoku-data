The orders were conveyed and completed, and we humbly accepted them. The head inspectors and head ashigaru officers informed us that we should estimate and report the portable cannon, ammunition, gunpowder, and other necessary supplies. On the same day, three men—Hayashi Bunemon, Usuki Yaemon, and Wakamatsu Jintayū—submitted their reports in writing.

Portable cannon to be dispatched to Wakamatsu:
One: The number of portable cannon coming from the armory is intentionally not recorded and kept as oral tradition
One: Hayashi Bunemon's custody: 5 large cannon 《breakdown: 2 hundred-monme ball cannon, 1 thirty-monme ball cannon》2 fifty-monme ball cannon
One: Usuki Kyūzaemon's custody: 3 large cannon 《breakdown: 1 hundred-monme ball cannon, 1 thirty-monme ball cannon》1 fifty-monme ball cannon

One: For training of the guard cannon unit, 2 large cannon in custody: fifty-monme ball cannon, thirty-monme ball cannon
《Note: These guard cannon unit custody pieces are among those in Hayashi Bunemon's custody that were stored in the armory two years ago. Bunemon originally had 8 cannon in his custody. These are large cannon transferred from Murakami Iemon》

The above large cannon were presented to the mansion, and the shortfall numbers for ammunition, gunpowder, and fuses were reported by the three leaders. Ramrods, priming irons, and cartridge cases were prepared and submitted as samples by Hayashi Bunemon's group. These were quickly manufactured by minor craftsmen. Due to insufficient large cannon, the following were borrowed from within the domain:
One: From Lord Kuroda Kaizaku: 2 portable large cannon, 1 fifty-monme ball cannon, 1 thirty-monme ball cannon
One: Lord Nomura Tarōbei: 1 portable large cannon
One: Lord Yoshida Shikibu: 1 portable large cannon
One: Lord Ōto Rokuzaemon: portable large cannon

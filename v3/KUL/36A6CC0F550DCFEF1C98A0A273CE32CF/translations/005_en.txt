We observed them dancing three times each on the ship before departing, and all found this strange. Everyone worshipped together, believing these must be guardian deities. On this day, we made divine lots marked "even" (gū) and "odd" (ki). If an even lot was drawn, it would be a divine sign; if odd, we would draw lots based on the usual visits of the small birds. When we drew, an even lot came up, so everyone rejoiced. If these were indeed guardian deities, we prayed that another bird would come to join them. The next day two birds came and danced down as usual. We all climbed up to the oars and called for them to perch on the ship. They immediately perched on the crossbeam, so we asked them to cry out, whereupon they cried three times each. After that, these birds visited every day until we drifted ashore in Bataan.

Meanwhile, the railings and other parts were successively torn away by the waves, causing indescribable hardship. However, from the next day for two or three days it became calm, so we continued drifting while making repairs. Around the twentieth, another great storm arose. In addition to the important rudder, the stern was also torn away, so we brought in the water buckets that had been set aside and worked with them. At that time, we spilled water, and the water we had stored was also consumed little by little until only a small amount remained, which we rationed daily for drinking and eating. But we had finally consumed it all and exhausted all means, so we hung buckets from the oars and waited for rain. However, it did not rain, and after about five days had passed, finally

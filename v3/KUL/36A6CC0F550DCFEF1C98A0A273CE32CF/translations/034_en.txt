After that, we were summoned daily and questioned about the conditions of those lands. While staying at the ageya (quarantine facility), we were ordered to take hot baths and have our topknots shaved three times each month, and were given nine mon daily as paper money. We were permitted to walk around within the ageya from dawn (6 o'clock) until evening (7 o'clock). Also, during our stay, we were ordered to visit shrines four times.

Regarding the details of this shipwreck and the customs of the countries we visited, we were questioned in detail about what we had observed and gave our account.

We responded that we were truly grateful and that this was an extremely fortunate blessing, and we were deeply grateful for such benevolence. Since we had drifted to foreign countries, we were informed that henceforth our ship work would be prohibited, and that we would not be allowed to travel to other provinces even by land routes. We humbly accepted these detailed instructions. There were no particularly troublesome matters to report, and we considered this a most fortunate situation.

At that time we understood everything. After that, Isohesama stayed by our ship daily. When high waves came, it would encircle the bow and stern to ward off the waves, extending to a length of fourteen or fifteen fathoms. When there were no wind or waves, it became a small crocodile of one shaku four or five sun and constantly stayed at the ship's edge. During this time, we discussed among ourselves, "It would be good if we could eat some fish." That very day, Isohesama drove many fish from offshore toward our ship - dolphinfish, small sea bream, red sea bream, bonito, and other small fish we had never seen before, chasing them around our vessel. We wanted to catch them but had no fishing hooks. Since so many had gathered, we bent the six-sun needles that people carried for sewing sails and threw them in as they were.

When we offered the heads of the caught dolphinfish to Isohesama, it would gladly accept them. Isohesama stayed with us until around the time when the golden gohei came down, but after that we could not see where it had gone. During this period, there was no wind and the waves were not severe enough to wash over us, so we pulled up the anchor and repaired the damaged areas. Around the twenty-eighth day of the tenth month, I believe, when the north wind began blowing strongly around seven in the evening, we dropped all six anchors at once, but they immediately wore through. The next day another one broke and fell away. We continued drifting as the north wind blew strongly throughout. On the sixth day of the eleventh month, when rain began falling and the sea calmed a little, after eating our evening meal, I climbed up to the watchtower and spotted a mountain. While we were all discussing and trying to approach it, day turned to evening.

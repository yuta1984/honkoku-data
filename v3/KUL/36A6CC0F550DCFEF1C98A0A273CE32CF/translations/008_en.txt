Tonight we cast divine lots to determine whether it would be good to approach this mountain, and immediately received a favorable oracle saying it would be good to land. We hurried to lower the small boat and transfer to it, when suddenly rain and wind came down all at once. The remaining four anchors caught on something, and as the wind was strong and the ship advanced like an arrow, all four anchor lines snapped at once. The ship danced forward and approached near the mountain, but before we could get close, we came upon a place where the island-mountain naturally formed what looked like an inlet.

The ship gradually went toward the open sea, when we spotted another island. We rejoiced as the ship headed toward it, but we encountered a place with fierce tidal currents, and with the wind and tide the ship...

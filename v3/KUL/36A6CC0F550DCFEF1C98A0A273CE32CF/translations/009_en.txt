We were dashed against the island, and the ship immediately split and shattered terribly, so all nineteen of us fell into the sea and nearly drowned. Of these, fourteen of us managed to swim to the island and climb up, but the ship's captain Gozaemon and the sailors Yaichi, Otokichi, Sokichi, and Yoshimatsu—these five men drowned at that time.

We had come ashore on the 7th day of the 11th month, which was a cold season, but that land was extremely warm—so much so that we could hardly bear the heat even in a single unlined garment. The North Star, which sailors call "ne no hitotsu boshi," appeared very low in that place. On the third day, when we looked across from a slightly elevated area near where we had landed, there was a large island, and something like a cow was swimming toward us from that direction. Since all three of us were hungry, we wanted to kill it for food and went around toward the beach, where we found something like a hollowed-out log, about nine shaku long and four shaku wide

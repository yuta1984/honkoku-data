gave each person about one sun square [of confection]. When they ate it, the taste was very good. When Manjirō gestured that he wanted a little more, [the captain] did not give more, saying it would not be good to give extra, but about an hour later gave them more again.

That night they anchored there. The next morning around dawn, the captain gestured to Manjirō to board the boat and go to land, so when Manjirō answered "yes," the captain also gestured to bring back the crew's clothing left on land. Six sailors took Manjirō aboard the boat, rowed out, collected the clothing and returned to the main ship. At that time they boiled pork and gave it to everyone. This was the first time in a long while they ate cooked food. From there they left the island and sailed out northward.

One day the following morning, they sailed past a place with rocks that looked like erected masts, went around the sea, and after about ten days spotted whales. They lowered four boats with six men each aboard and went to catch them.

At this time the sailors made gestures of sucking in air to teach the five men that they were going to catch whales. The main ship was over thirty ken long, over seven ken wide, about four ken deep, with thirty-six crew members, three masts, and thirty-two sails, though when catching whales they used twelve sails. The boats were four ken two shaku long, about one ken wide, with two masts and

two sails. The ship's name was John Howland, and the captain's name was Fisher.

On this day they caught three whales, and at sunset rowed back to the main ship, tied them to the main ship, and gradually brought them aboard.

To bring the whales aboard, they rigged a large pulley to the middle mast, ran a net through it with hook-like devices at the end, caught the whale's black skin, and with a windlass at the stern wound it up while cutting it with knives and taking it aboard from one side. The cutting begins from the head. In the stern there were three large cauldrons big enough to boil whales, and in those cauldrons they rendered the oil. The dregs were used as fuel under the cauldrons. The oil was put in barrels from the stern end and stored in the ship's hold. Large whales, they say, are about one hundred shaku long (that is, twenty jō).

After departing from that island, for about four months they caught about twenty whales in various ocean waters, and in mid-October arrived at Honolulu in the Western lands. Then the four men Denzō, Gozaemon, Jūsuke, and Toraemon were entrusted by the ship captain who had rescued them to officials of this country, and [the ship] departed from this place (these officials were probably Americans who had come from America). This place has a circumference of about thirty ri (Japanese ri), with high mountains, and the houses are like Japanese thatched roofs, and the people's complexion is also like Japanese. The men's hair is cut short, women wear it long, bundled and wound in back, fastened with combs

Together they make the Hawaiian Kingdom. This place is six to seven hundred ri by sea from America, and the people and language are the same as America. In recent years this place has prospered and is like Kawaguchi in Osaka, Japan. It is a place of trade with various countries, with many shops throughout the country, and also teahouses and courtesans. The climate is like Japanese spring and autumn, with no real summer heat, they say.

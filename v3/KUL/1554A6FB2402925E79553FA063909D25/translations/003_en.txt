When it broke, they hurriedly tried to tie it to the ship's beam with body ropes, but while they were in confusion, about twenty fellow boats had all gotten ahead, leaving them far behind. They exhausted their strength trying to set up the oars, but the oars broke, their spirit was exhausted, and they became even less able to maneuver the boat freely. They tried to raise the sail slightly to head toward land, but the waves and wind were fierce, and as evening approached, the waves became so large they could barely endure them. They used various methods to get through and spent the night. On the morning of the eighth day, when they looked toward land, it appeared to be off the coast of Murotsu, and although they could see houses in the distance, the oars were broken or lost, leaving them with no way to approach land. They could only drift at the mercy of wind and tide. Large waves crashed in, filling the boat with water, and they took turns bailing to survive. On the ninth day, with rainy weather and north winds, the storm grew even worse. Although the previous night's large waves had turned the water salty, they cooked gruel with that water and boiled their caught fish for everyone to eat. At this time, the cold was unbearable, their clothes were soaked, and everyone was freezing. Among them, Jūsuke and Gozaemon could no longer move their hands and feet. Denzō took the rudder while Toraemon and Manjirō bailed water to weather the wind and waves. On the tenth day, the wind and waves calmed somewhat, changing to a northeast wind, and as it rained, they covered themselves with straw mats to shelter from the rain, cooked gruel with the little rice remaining, and boiled fish for everyone to eat. Since they had no firewood at this time, they broke up floorboards to use as fuel. The wind changed again to the west, and the boat drifted as if flying.

On the eleventh day, northwest winds blew strongly, and at this time their rice was exhausted, there was no water, and they faced starvation. On the twelfth day, though the wind was the same as the previous day, they saw many seagulls, so they all talked together, wondering if they were getting close to islands and mountains, and took comfort in this. On the thirteenth day there was a great storm and the waves became even higher. However, around noon, Toraemon spotted an island to the southeast, and everyone greatly regained their spirits, gained great strength, made vows to gods and buddhas, received the wind straight astern, and ran with sails raised toward the island they could see. But the current was swift and the boat would not advance, causing great difficulty. At this time Denzō took the rudder, cut loose the body ropes, Toraemon and Jūsuke took in the sail, Manjirō bailed water, and Gozaemon could not work because his hands were frozen, until evening came. They finally approached close to the island, but the wind and waves were rough and they could not land on the rocky shore, so they tried to drop anchor and moor, but there were wave-beaten rocks on the bottom making it difficult for the boat to anchor. Therefore, they adjusted the oar with the broken handle and went around the island to look, finding it was all rock and stone, extremely precipitous shores with poor landing spots. They gradually found one place suitable for landing a boat, rowed close to this spot, dropped anchor, and spent the night on the boat.

On the morning of the fourteenth day, everyone tried to swim ashore and look for water, but seeing many large sharks, they all became frightened and changed their plan, trying to beach the boat to disembark, but large waves came and the boat filled with water. Then everyone landed and Jūsuke and Go[...]

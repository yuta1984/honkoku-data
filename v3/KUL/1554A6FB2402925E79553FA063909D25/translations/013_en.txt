about one cho inland, with a wide route. Now here they hired a steamship and traveled 150 ri up
the river, arriving at Sacramento. They paid 25 silver pieces for the fare, then hired horses,
loaded their luggage on carts pulled by horses, and traveled another 150 ri (about 70 ri total in Japanese distance).
At this place there were three rivers (located in this southern area). Working on the north side, with daily wages of 6 silver pieces including meals, he worked for thirty-four or five days, earning wages of over 200 silver pieces. However, his employer lost at gambling and
had everything including household goods taken away, leaving not a single silver piece of wages, so he bought
digging tools himself and dug for gold for about 70 days, accumulating about 6 silver pieces worth from his digging. With this, he borrowed cattle and horses as before,
returned to Sacramento, then returned to San Francisco by steamship, rented lodging,
and during a ten-day stay found passage on a merchant ship going to Hawaii (ship name Ekisharifute),
sailed heading southwest, and arrived in Hawaii in the tenth month of the dog year. ○ Here he
met Toraemon and inquired about Denzo and Gozaemon, who were said to be farming in the countryside about three ri away,

Manjiro said, "I came thinking to return to Japan. Won't you return together?" and
both replied "If it's possible, we'd like to return," so he said "It's quite possible" and they made a firm
promise, and from then on the four stayed together. Denzo felt bad about just eating without working and said, "Until there's a convenient
ship, I'll go to the countryside to work," and left for the countryside. At that time, American whaling ships had
brought castaways from Kishu, with two people on one ship and three on another, and hearing this from that ship captain,
Manjiro said "Japanese people are dear to me" and went to meet them. When he tried to converse
but found the language difficult to communicate, he said "There are people on land who can understand the conversation, so let's bring them,"
and after consulting with that captain, he brought them along to meet Toraemon. When he heard the details, they were from Kishu
Hidaka District, the cargo ship Tenjumaru, with captain Torakichi and 13 sailors, going to Edo.
They had departed Edo in the first month of this dog year, were blown off course by northwest winds, had their mast broken,
damaged their rudder, and drifted near Russia. In the third month of the same year, they were rescued by an American whaling ship
and while continuing whaling activities, they found three similar ships, came together, and were adrift.

Item　Copy of a letter sent from our lord's senior retainer in Edo to the Fukuoka senior retainers

"Regarding the violation in the repelling of the Chinese ship off Wakamatsu on the sixteenth day of the fourth month, His Lordship found the method of repelling with firearms this time to be appropriate. He has ordered that in future cases of drifting ships, they should be repelled in the same manner as this time. As instructed, on the seventh day of last month, the duty officer Lord Inoue Kawachi-no-kami summoned our caretaker and conveyed orders through a written directive. When they went out to the waters off [location unclear] and demonstrated force there, the detailed violations came to His Lordship's attention and he took notice. Word has come from Edo to convey this matter."

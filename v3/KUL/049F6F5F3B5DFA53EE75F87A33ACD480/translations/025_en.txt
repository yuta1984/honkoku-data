Having cannon fired upon them, with not a single Chinese person appearing on the upper deck, [our forces] rowed around in circular attacks, firing eighty to ninety shots. According to the predetermined arrangement, when Fujii Kanzaemon's boat raised the signal equipment, all five vessels ceased cannon fire and stopped shooting arrows. Immediately, Matsumoto Ichiro-emon gave the command, and ten elite naval personnel with boat captains Nishimura Saheta, Usami Gonemon, and Komori Shichibei as the three leaders boarded the Chinese ship. Since the Chinese ship had a different height than whaling vessels, it was not easy to climb aboard quickly, but among them, four or five elite sailors threw grappling hooks and boat hooks onto the Chinese ship, boarded it, and pulled up the large crew of naval personnel hand by hand. Once everyone had boarded, using the bamboo spears, large swords, and axes they had prepared beforehand, they broke through the upper deck and threw away anything that would hinder their work.

They cut the heavy ropes of four anchors on the starboard side and threw them into the sea. Afterward, they divided into groups, entered the ship's hold to search out the Chinese, with some striking down Chinese who resisted using poles, boat hooks, and grappling hooks, others striking them head-on or across the face, and others crushing their hip bones. Working with all their might, the Chinese became frightened and all fled into the ship's hold. After that, they knocked over jars and similar items, smashed boxes containing sacks and other cargo, barrels, scrolls, and the like, and threw everything visible inside—down to pots, pans, and stoves—into the sea, ransacking the ship's interior at will, causing great commotion. When Fujii and Matsumoto gave the command that the sailors should now withdraw, everyone returned to their respective original boats. Observing the situation, after a while the Chinese began crawling out from the ship's hold, one after another.

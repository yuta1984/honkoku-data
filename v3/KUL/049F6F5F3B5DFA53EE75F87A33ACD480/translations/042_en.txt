Regarding the matter of the drifting Chinese ship, as before, due to the winter sea, the ocean surface has become increasingly rough, and although the Chinese ship sometimes approaches, it is difficult to venture offshore. The Chinese ship is anchored in the open sea, and since encounters occur daily, small boat captains are added from among the five artillery vessels for daily offshore reconnaissance missions. However, from the 19th day of the 12th month, the Chinese ship's sails and such could no longer be seen. Regarding this matter, there was an urgent report to Fukuoka.

1. Since the Chinese ship was no longer visible, as replacement personnel dispatched on the 25th day of the 12th month of the Year of the Dog, the crew composition is as follows:

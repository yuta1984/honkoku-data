「Right Volume」
To report on these matters, lookouts or official vessels go out daily for offshore observation. The situation is as follows:
One Chinese ship can be seen drifting about ten ri or more in the direction of inui (northwest) from Jinoshima.
From around the first day of the seventh month, it could be seen about seven to eight ri offshore. During this period, there were one or two occasions when they went out to repel the ship, but the naval officers' judgments were inconsistent, and ultimately no pursuit was carried out during this tour of duty. Generally, the sea conditions were poor, so they did not sortie.

Item: The lodging for the samurai stationed on Jinoshima was cramped, with neighboring houses close by, and a large amount of gunpowder had been brought in, making fire precautions worrisome. Therefore, a wooden storage shed for gunpowder was set up in the mountains about ten chō away from the houses, with minor officials and district workers taking turns as guards day and night.

Item: Personnel dispatched to Jinoshima on the seventh day of the seventh month for the above-mentioned rotation:

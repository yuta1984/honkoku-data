Just as [the Chinese ship] was trying to set its main sail and mizzen sail to head out to sea, [our forces] again lined up cannons in formation and fired upon them, rowing alongside from one direction and firing about one hundred and fifty shots in pursuit. As [the Chinese ship] gradually retreated toward the open sea, [our forces] continued the pursuit bombardment for quite some time, then ceased fire and let them escape. The total number of shots fired was two hundred and twenty rounds, and the Chinese ship appeared to be damaged in several places with some Chinese casualties. During all this, Fukuda Kasuke had been suffering from food poisoning since the previous night, but he said that while everyone was going out to fight, he could not remain at the lodging, that even if he died aboard ship he should go out with everyone else, and that he felt somewhat better, so he forced himself to join the expedition. Though they went out to sea, because of his serious illness he lay down inside the ship, unable to raise his head throughout.

During the attack on the Chinese ship and the circular bombardment, he sent out his assistant Fukui Denbei to fight alongside the others. Meanwhile, [the others] paid attention to Kasuke's condition and gave him purgative medicine for his illness. Now as the Chinese ship retreated and everyone returned from their boats, Fukuda was barely breathing, just managing to stay alive. Denpei came to Fukuda's side and said, "We've finally reached Jishima. Please disembark from the ship. Let's get off the ship." At that time, Fukuda, though barely conscious, said, "Even if I die inside this ship, I have no desire to go ashore." The gunners gathered around saying, "Surely you won't fail to return to the lodging after surviving this long," and they spread tatami mats on wooden boards, and with many sailors [carried] him, unable to rise, to the inn.

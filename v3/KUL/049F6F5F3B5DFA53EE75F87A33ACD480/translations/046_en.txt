"Right Volume"
At dawn, they attacked the Chinese ship, firing repeatedly with ten large cannons, loading and reloading. There was no wind at all and the Chinese ship did not move from that position, so they were able to fire as much as they intended. The Chinese crew had no choice but to hide in the ship's hold. Having damaged the Chinese ship to a good extent, a message came from Akashi Sanbei's group via messenger boat saying "Please assess whether there appears to be a ceasefire," so they ceased fire. Then a little wind arose, and the Chinese crew crawled out from the ship's hold, adjusted their sails, and finally set sail. After observing the situation for a while and confirming that they were indeed withdrawing, they returned to Ashiya. The total number of shots fired at the aforementioned Chinese ship was 376. This matter was promptly reported to Fukuoka.

The oil for lighting is obtained by pressing the nuts of palm-like trees that grow around all the houses. The price of one sho of that oil is approximately eighty mon. There is also something called "kabaya" - nests of birds resembling swallows, white and resembling monkey seats, with black feathers attached to the hollow interior. These are probably used as medicine, and are sold for about eighty monme of silver per kin through Dutch silver imports. These nests are found in very dark places within rock caves, and people enter with fire and lights to collect them. However, the ruler has prohibited taking them arbitrarily, and officials regulate this. One year, a black man secretly took some and came to sell them to a merchant house near Magoshichi's place. It happened that an official was passing by and noticed the goods for sale, entered the house, captured the black man, and interrogated him severely. The black man told various lies trying to escape his crime, so the official's questioning became increasingly harsh. Perhaps thinking he could no longer escape, the black man suddenly seized the sword the official was wearing, seriously wounded two officials, and fled.

At that time, Magoshichi was standing at the gate of that house when someone came running out from the back with a drawn sword, so wondering what was happening, he was about to enter when one man came chasing the black man while holding his belly, but soon collapsed at the gate. Blood flowed profusely from his leg, so Magoshichi was startled to see this and hesitated for a while. Then another person appeared to be chasing, but after running about two cho, he too collapsed in the same way. Meanwhile, people who appeared to be officials came rushing to this house one after another, and soon carrying weapons - "spears! halberds! guns!" - some went searching the riverside and beach areas, others entered the mountains, dividing forces in all directions with tremendous commotion. Thinking "This is interesting, I'll go and see," Magoshichi followed behind the pursuers. For a while their whereabouts were completely unknown, but going deeper into the mountains, he saw that the black man had climbed to the top of a large tree and was hiding there, holding his breath. The pursuers tried to climb the tree to capture him, but it was a tree of several dozen jo in height, not easy to climb.

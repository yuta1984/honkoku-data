He engaged in conversations near the heir or the sons and daughters, and was invited by various officials and wealthy merchants
almost every day without exception. Because of this, he was able to tour every corner of the castle, and wherever
he went, thanks to the "medal" he wore on his chest, he was treated as a special foreigner and was never
reprimanded. He even rode in a carriage with an official who could be called equivalent to a senior councilor (rōjū) in our country, going on excursions to the suburbs,

at which the man laughed heartily. As for martial arts practice, they focused mainly on artillery and marching drills, while their bladed
weapons seemed dull and unable to cut. Only hunters carried bows, and those bows were quite crude,
like those of our Ainu people. In general, this country has very many wild animals, and they export much of the fur
to foreign countries. In contrast, medicinal herbs and such are very scarce.
The extent to which this country clearly knows about our country is truly astonishing—
there are many books that record our country's circumstances in detail, as well as general maps of Japan, with the names of cities, mountains,

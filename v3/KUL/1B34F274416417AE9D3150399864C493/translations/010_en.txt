No one carried even an inch of steel, and moreover, the enemy was numerous while they were few in number. Tragically, more than thirty men fell in the blink of an eye. Only thirteen remained. Now powerless, they hid in various places, but were sought out and captured, their hands and feet bound and placed there. All the bandits gathered around, and though what they were saying was incomprehensible, the clamorous voices cursing and making noise were naturally deafening. The mortification and resentment felt by the thirteen men at this time cannot be fully expressed by this poor brush - please try to imagine and understand it. These fierce bandits, who at first seemed to number about five hundred, when now gathered in one place, appeared to exceed approximately one thousand.

The bandits were still not satisfied with this. They then all headed toward our ship, killed those aboard, and seized all the equipment without exception. However, only two persons survived from the ship. One was the ship's captain Kunita Hyōemon, and the other was a fourteen-year-old boy who served as sandal-bearer for Sanai Tōzō. Hyōemon had jumped into the sea and was shot at from all directions, his life already in grave danger, when the two men who had earlier been given food and drink intervened in various ways to save him. The bandits soon brought these two men along and, together with those captured on the mountain, making fifteen people in total, shackled their hands and feet and chained them all in one place.

Adding to this, today they again fell into the hands of barbarian bandits, lost many crew members, and furthermore had their ship seized and their wealth plundered. These fifteen men, though their bitter lives were spared, wondered if they would ever be able to return to their homeland again.

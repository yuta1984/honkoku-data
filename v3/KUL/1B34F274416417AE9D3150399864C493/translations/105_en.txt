They had only about one sho and five go of rice remaining, which was insufficient even for one normal day's ration. No matter how they tried to make thin gruel like hot water, since there was no way to obtain food within the next few days, the six men could only face starvation before their eyes.

While they struggled thus, the fishing boat saw them and immediately rowed away somewhere. They tried to row toward the shore anyway, but it was too shallow to approach closely, so they had no choice but to drop anchor at a place far from the shore

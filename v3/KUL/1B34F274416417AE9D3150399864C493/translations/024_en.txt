They caught such birds by hand and boiled them for food, so they had no shortage of clothing and food.

However, no matter how long they stayed there, there was no way to find a passing ship, so they all consulted together and decided: "Even if we have no luck and meet with disaster again, it would be better than dying here. If only we have the divine protection of gods and buddhas, we might be able to return to our homeland. First, we should build some kind of ship, no matter what." From then on, using the camphor board they had found earlier as material and combining it with the ship equipment they had gathered when their main ship was wrecked, they spent nearly fifty days and completed a new ship about the size of a four-tan sail vessel. Though the ship was small, it was more than sufficient for six people. Particularly during that time, they had processed turtles and fish into dried strips and stored them in straw bags, so they would not lack provisions for several days.

"Now let us row out toward our homeland!" The six men all boarded together and set sail in the morning, heading toward mountains visible far to the northwest. After a water route of twelve or thirteen ri, they reached shore that same night at midnight. They stayed on that island for five or six days, observing the island's conditions, and found that its size,

There were trees that had also grown abundantly on the previous island, with leaves like ginger leaves, about two feet around the base and thirteen fathoms tall, with beautiful wood grain. Thinking to take them as souvenirs after returning home, they cut down two trees about one jō in length, loaded them on the ship, and set sail in the morning.

Riding the south wind, they sailed until the next morning, and when they had come about twenty-two or twenty-three ri to what seemed like another island, they moored their ship there as well. This island was narrower than the previous two islands, with lower mountains, and both this island and the previous one had no harbors. Also, between the first island and this island, there were fifteen islands of about one, two, and three ri in circumference each. They stayed on this island for two days, then set sail in the morning, taking the helm to the northwest, blown by favorable winds and gentle breezes. After sailing for eight days and nights, when they thought they had come about two hundred seventy to eighty ri from the first island, they reached an island where many houses could be seen. Wondering what kind of island it was, they went ashore and found it was Hachijojima of their own Japan. The joy of all was beyond comparison, and feeling as if they had already returned to their own homes, they immediately reported to the magistrate's office, which I hear was on the twenty-fifth day of the fourth month.

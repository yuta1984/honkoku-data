it works well for transferring fire. After two or three years passed and the sickle and stone were exhausted, since there is plenty of firewood, we take great care to keep fires burning both day and night. Even so, when the fire occasionally goes out, we climb two or three chō up to where smoke rises from the island mountaintop. Since there is a place where fire naturally burns, we make torch-like objects from reed-like materials, bring them there, transfer fire from that source, and return. In any case, we take great care to prevent the fire from going out day and night. When it rains and the fire becomes damp and goes out, we are particularly troubled during such times.

One: Among the total of twelve people including the captain, sailors, and passenger - captain Sadayū, sailors Kisaburō, Kisaburō, Hachidayū, Zengorō, Zenzaemon, two additional sailors hired in Edo named Zentarō and Hachibe, and Gonjirō who took passage from Nanbu to Kanagawa in Bushū - of these nine people, six were from Arai in Enshū, two were born in Musashi, and one was from Iwachi village in Izu. All twelve of us remained alive for about three years after drifting to the island, then gradually died over the following ten years or so. However, since we have no way of knowing the exact dates, I do not remember them. Regarding the illnesses that caused their deaths, they naturally weakened as if from old age, and also their bodies swelled from poor food, leading to their deaths.

"If you return the ship to Kobuchi, raise two fires; if you remain offshore, each raise one fire," they agreed, but as the weather gradually worsened, many ships turned back during this time. When everyone on board clamored to turn the ship back, Nihee held the ship steady even more, saying "It cannot be helped for us who are not gods - perhaps the wind might calm down," and while watching the ships that were turning back, they spent some time there. The sun had already sunk into the western sea, and the scenery in all four directions as evening gradually fell became increasingly eerie.

There was no other recourse but to pray. Nevertheless, thinking that gods and buddhas would help only if they worked hard, and that there would be no benefit without effort, the entire crew worked with all their remaining strength. Perhaps the gods and buddhas took pity on them - after some time the thunder ceased and the rainfall became sparse, and the moon of the twentieth night began to shine through the clouds. Thus the night gradually broke into dawn, the torn clouds scattered by the wind cleared as the sun rose, and the sky became completely clear. However, the wind alone did not cease, the swells remained fierce, and when the rudder was knocked down by cross-waves making things dangerous again, they threw the remaining timber

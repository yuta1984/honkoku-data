The two men boarded the ship, departed from that place on the thirteenth day of the ninth month, and on the seventeenth day of the tenth month, joyfully
arrived at Nemuro in the eastern Ezo region of our Japan. The time was the third day of the ninth month of Kansei 5 in our country,
and since the group had been following the Russian calendar from the fourth year of Tenmei, year of the rabbit, there was a difference of more than forty
days. The three men were immediately handed over to the Matsumae magistrate, then sent to Edo
and presented before the shogun. For people of our country to drift to the European continent
and return home safely, these three men were the first, making this a truly auspicious and rare event.
However, pitifully, Koichi's hardships of more than ten years came to nothing like foam on water, for by the time they reached Japan,
he had already died in Nemuro—whether to call this pitiful or unfortunate.
　Now the two men, having finished their interrogation by the shogun, withdrew from the court and returned to their lodgings at the stables near Kiji Bridge,

searching for the memorial towers in Ekōin, asking "Is it this one or that one?"

carved on them, so realizing
this was the one who had returned, crowds of onlookers
gathered like at a market.

This year also ended, and on the thirteenth day of the sixth month of the following year, Kansei 6, year of the tiger,
both men, having drifted to foreign countries
and endured many years and hardships before
returning home, were deemed to have shown
admirable devotion and were each granted thirty ryō in gold. As a special measure,
they were not permitted to return
to their home provinces but were made to reside
within the medicinal herb cultivation
grounds on vacant land in Edo's
Banchō district, and as
monthly stipends,
Kōdayū received three ryō
and Isokichi two ryō each

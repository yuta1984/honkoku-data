They immediately rushed over, taking handfuls and stuffing them in their mouths. When they reached for yet another handful, the natives restrained their hands and gestured that raw rice would be harmful to their stomachs, so it should be cooked into rice before eating. They gestured to indicate that there were still two more people remaining in the boat who should also be given some, so they brought it to the boat and had them chew small amounts, cooking the remainder into rice. Then the natives brought porridge and gave it to them, so the four men on land first ate this little by little, and after a while, toward evening, they were given porridge again. The joy of the group at this time was beyond description - it could never be fully expressed in words.

However, when that day ended and night came, they brought wooden shackles made by boring holes in square posts, fitted each of the four men's feet separately into one piece of wood, and bound both ends with rope.

The fact that their language did not communicate with that of the natives was most advantageous for accomplishing this stratagem. The natives examined and carried away their clothing and baggage, pulled the boat from the sea into a river, confiscated the four kan of coins that had been placed inside, and kept the group on the sand for seven days. During this time, their meals consisted of food prepared by the chief. Initially there were about eighty guards, but later this became sixty to seventy. The climate of that place was unlike winter - the sun was unbearably strong during the day, so they barely endured the heat with a simple shade structure the natives had built.

On the night of the twenty-third day, at the fifth hour (8 PM in current time), they removed everyone's shackles, took them to an empty house in a village two or three cho away, brought them before what appeared to be a village official's house, and some matter...

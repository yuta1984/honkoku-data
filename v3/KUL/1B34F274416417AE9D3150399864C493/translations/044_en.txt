The way they stared was quite amusing.

The villages were connected by rice fields, with occasional dark-colored pine trees and tea plants growing thick. While viewing this scenery, they were carried in shoulder-borne palanquins for over ten ri, reaching the fifth village after seven o'clock (four o'clock in the afternoon by today's time). This village was rather large, and the construction of the houses was not unsightly. However, the roofs were mostly thatched. They stayed overnight in this village, and though the depth of the house was unclear, the frontage seemed to be fifty or sixty ken. The entire interior was covered with leather, several raised platforms were arranged, and about ten layers of leather were spread on top for everyone to sit on. The four sides were hung with gold brocade curtains, and elsewhere in the house, curtains of foreign cotton with red patterns on a gray background were hung, and they were again treated with sake and dumplings. The sake was like three-year-old wine—though dark in color, it had a sweet taste with sourness that made it undrinkable. They also served side dishes, but these had a foul odor and were inedible.

The next morning, two men who appeared to be officials of that country came riding in extremely elaborate palanquins like the bamboo sedan chairs of our Hakone, accompanied by about thirty attendants.

They asked the castaways something, but it was completely incomprehensible. So they brought out a world map to show them, and when the castaways pointed to the place marked "Japan," the officials nodded and seemed to be thinking about something. After a while, they ordered their attendants to take large dumpling-like objects from leather chests about five or six shaku long and gave three to each of the castaways. These also had a terrible odor and were inedible, but thinking it would be rude not to taste them at all, they shared just one among the four men and didn't touch the rest, whereupon the officials laughed heartily. Later, the two officials gave some orders to the local headman, got back into their palanquins, bowed once to the castaways, and departed. Thereafter, they were placed on the same planks and transported from village to village as before for about thirty days until they reached what seemed to be the national capital. At the entrance to this place was a great river as large as the Miya River in Ise Province, which they crossed by boat, and then passed fourteen townhouses

The ship gradually progressed until the mountains around Guangdong could soon be seen, so the sailors all climbed up the masts to keep watch, and they gave five mon in money [one mon equals five monme of silver] to whoever first spotted the mountains of Guangdong, then whoever spotted the mountains of Ryukyu

Five bridges were built side by side, with the bridge pillars, beams, floorboards, and railings all made of stone, and dragon carvings attached to the railings. The reason for building five bridges side by side was that during New Year and other ceremonial days, there would be tremendous congestion. It was said that one of the bridges was specifically for the king's imperial processions. Within the six ri square area, mansion-style townhouses stood without gaps, much like the capital of Tartary, but the prosperous appearance seemed far superior.

In both countries, the summer climate was the same as Japan's, but winter was twice as cold as Japan. In Tartary it snowed, and in Beijing they heard it snowed only a little during the coldest period, but people of both countries seemed not to suffer greatly from the cold. Now, Beijing too appeared to have been conquered by the Tartar king, and Beijing people also shaved their head hair in the same manner as the Tartars. For clothing, they wore one undergarment, then over that one thin cotton-padded garment, and for outer wear, they used fur with the hair side turned inward, with the outside made splendidly of silk gauze, satin, shuuchin and such fabrics.

Now, regarding the cuisine of this region: fish, birds, cattle, sheep, pigs, and other beast meat were boiled in water with soy sauce and salt added to make soup, vegetables were boiled in water and eaten with soy sauce. Sometimes they cooked with miso, but the taste was very different from Japan's. Tartar miso was made from millet, while in Beijing it was made from rice and millet. Beijing was said to be five to six days' journey from the coast, so there was no seafood at all, only river fish like carp and crucian carp. Rice was bought and sold as white rice, and during their stay, the market price was one sho of white rice for one monme of silver. The local people said it was expensive due to recent post-war conditions.

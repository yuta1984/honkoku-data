Assuming it was merely an interrogation about the circumstances of their drift ashore, they falsely replied through writing and gestures that they were "nineteen men from Satsuma, Japan, who had drifted while sailing to Edo in Musashi Province." The official also seemed unable to understand clearly and departed. That night everyone slept there, and early the next morning on September 1st, Ikeyama and others were concerned about the safety of their abandoned ship. They sent five men including the sailor Jinpei to check on it, while he himself went to the maritime office to request that the abandoned ship be brought in. The response was that they would move it once the weather cleared, so he could not insist and returned.

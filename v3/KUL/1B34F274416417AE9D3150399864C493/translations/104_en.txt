Since it was difficult to know how much longer their ordeal would last, they consulted and agreed that conserving these two provisions was essential. They put a lock on the water bucket and forbade drinking carelessly. When it rained, they brought out all containers to catch every drop. For food, the six men cooked about one sho of rice per day, and since they had completely run out of firewood, they split up ship equipment to burn. However, due to the scarcity of food, they became so weak that even splitting firewood became difficult.

From the thirteenth day onward, day after day the northwest wind blew without rest, continuing in the same manner until the twenty-third day. Then they saw an unfamiliar large bird flying near the bow and stern, which puzzled everyone. They said to each other, "Indeed, seeing such a strange bird means we must be very far from our homeland. Alas, what unfortunate souls we are!" They spoke thus and wrung their sleeves in sorrow. From 10 AM on the twenty-third day, an east wind carried the boat toward the west-southwest.

In three days they caught three fish, using these as food to extend their provisions for four days. The boat continued drifting westward daily with the east wind until, on the morning of December tenth, they finally saw a single mountain peak. All six men rejoiced greatly, thinking there must surely be inhabited villages there. Steadying their trembling legs, they barely managed to stand and steer the boat toward it, only to find disappointingly that it was a volcanic island with no human presence. Around that island were six or seven more islands, but all were uninhabited wastelands, so the group again became greatly discouraged. However, reasoning that since such small islands existed, there must surely be inhabited land further west, they recovered their spirits somewhat and continued running day and night at the wind's mercy. By this time, the food for the six men in the boat was merely rice

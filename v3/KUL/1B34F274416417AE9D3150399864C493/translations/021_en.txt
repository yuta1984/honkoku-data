Even before reaching the waters off Enshū, which they had heard was a dangerous area, a sudden violent wind arose, and the raging waves immediately became mountain-high. They could not row close to land, nor could they even freely lower their sails. With no means at their disposal, all hands clasped together and hung their heads, entrusting their fate to heaven and letting the ship drift as it would, no different from drifting dead leaves. Gradually, gradually they were carried away, and by the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth month, they had completely consumed all their rice provisions. From then on, they ate the mandarins in the ship to barely sustain their lives. After the new year dawned and from mid-January of the tenth year, though the wind changed to the northeast, the current never ceased for a moment, and they drifted ever farther from land. Now there was nothing to be seen but the vast, raging waves. However, thinking it would be better than eating mandarins, they devised fishing tackle and cast their lines. On the twenty-first day of that month, they caught two kumabiki fish measuring two shaku four or five sun, which they boiled in salt water for food. On the twenty-third day they caught three more, and thereafter they fished daily to stave off hunger. One day a blue fish about three fathoms long came alongside their boat, so they hauled it up, thinking it was good prey that would provide food for several days.

They prepared the remainder as dried strips for storage. During this time, their fresh water was completely exhausted and they had nothing to drink, so they were forced to drink seawater. Though they could not determine exactly what day it was, around the fourth hour of the night (10 PM in modern time) there was rainfall, so they caught it in a small boat, collecting about three shō, which they treasured more than medicine and all drank. This too was exhausted in a few days, and now these people's world had no calendar days. Suffering on the water with not a single drop to drink, and to obtain food, even while being tossed by the waves, they had no choice but to continue fishing. Their bodies and hearts were completely exhausted, and there was nothing they could do but weep. Then, around the twentieth day of February, they spotted a small island. The joy was incomparable to finding a single point of dawn light when traveling by night. Thinking that the gods and Buddha had not yet killed them, the group felt revived for the first time. They approached and dropped anchor, but the rope frayed and broke, and the ship was dashed against the rocks and destroyed. They transferred to a small boat and landed, first seeking water to quench the thirst that had tormented them for so many days, and fortunately found a small stream flowing.

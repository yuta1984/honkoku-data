difficulties, damaging ships and causing deaths - such examples are not few. Moreover, for a small boat like the one built this time, even the timber may be of a quality weak for sea travel, and first of all, there is no iron - it was made by joining wood pieces as nails and binding them with tree bark rope. To sail in such a small boat from this remote part of India to Japan, which may be tens of thousands of ri away, is such an uncertain undertaking that I absolutely cannot agree to it." He declared this firmly, and no matter how they tried to persuade him, he would not be convinced, nor would he help with shipbuilding. So the group said: "Though it is true that this ship is small, we are blessed to be born in the divine land of Japan. To serve these barbarians at the ends of India and become dust of this island soil would be extremely regrettable. Even if we were to live long, it would be of no worth. One could hardly say that merely being alive makes one human." Though they reasoned with him thus, he showed no sign of compliance whatsoever. Since everyone else was determined, they said: "Whether we drift on the sea and become foam, or miraculously return to Japan, let it be as fate wills.

But I alone will remain on this island, and think it better to live on, even if just for a year or half a year." This he declared definitively. Even though it was the man's own wish, they could not bear the regret of leaving one person behind in this barbarous land, so they tried various means and changed their approach to persuade him, but he would not listen in the slightest. They agreed that on the day of departure, they would forcibly capture him and make him board, but Gorozo fled and hid in various places, never coming near them. Even when they inquired with his master, he had hidden himself so well that his whereabouts became completely unknown. Reluctantly, they decided that eleven people would board, but their only fear was that he might reveal their deception to the natives.

In due course, the ship they had built with all their might was completed, so on the fourth day of the third month of the Boar Year, the eleven gathered together, invoked the god Atago, purified their hearts and prostrated themselves in worship. They offered divination lots to Amaterasu Omikami asking whether Japan lay to the north or east, and the lot indicated north. Then they drew lots asking whether the auspicious day for departure would be late in the fourth month, and the lot indicated mid-month.

We gestured to show them to push using both hands, and they did as we instructed, putting strength into both hands and pushing, but we immediately pushed back and won all the matches, which was very satisfying. They also challenged us to sumo wrestling, and we did not refuse but engaged with them. In this too they were extremely weak, and we won every match.

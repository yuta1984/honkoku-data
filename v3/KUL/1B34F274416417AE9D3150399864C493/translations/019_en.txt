While waiting, on the tenth day as promised, they were given about twenty sheep and much food and drink. On the eleventh day, fifteen horses were brought, and men dressed as samurai came to escort them, taking the castaways to the magistrate's office. From there, they prepared ceremonial displays including two large banners with five-clawed dragons, eight small white flags, four small red flags, three umbrella-spears, and twelve staffs—all provided as Chinese hospitality—and with about one hundred attendants added, they first set out for Korea.

During this journey, the roads were good and there were post stations. They crossed frozen rivers about three to four towns wide on foot and horseback together with their animals, though in summer they would cross by boat. Nothing else was particularly unusual, and they were entertained at various places. On the ninth day of the twelfth month, they reached the Korean border, where about two hundred people from Korea were waiting to receive them, along with ten people who had been sent from Ming China as escorts. The route was mostly mountain paths with little flat ground, and they crossed three major rivers on the ice, arriving at the Korean capital on the twenty-eighth day of the same month.

One table was piled high with various kinds of beef, mutton, and fish, along with various vegetables, with artificial flowers placed on top, and whole catfish and other birds arranged on it—there were probably sixty to seventy different items on one table. On the other table, rice cakes, steamed buns, and various other confections were beautifully arranged, also numbering what seemed like sixty to seventy varieties. After these two tables were set, sake was served, and then as the meal proper, on two tables about three feet square, various fish and bird dishes, soups, vegetables, and other items—some fifty to sixty varieties—were served. The elaborate hospitality was beyond description.

They spent that year in Korea, and on the seventh day of the first month of the following Year of the Dog, they left the capital. After traveling for about ten days, at a place called Shinsatsu, they received hospitality from the local daimyo, and upon departure were given farewell gifts of five quires of paper and five pounds of tobacco each. On the twenty-eighth day they arrived at Tongnae, where the local magistrate, also a daimyo, provided hospitality and gave them two quires of paper each and fifteen strings of dried persimmons.

　　　　Foreword
1. This book was compiled with the purpose of informing children about maritime affairs and serving as an aid to national education.
1. The book limits its collection to the Tokugawa period because records from earlier periods are sparse and few materials can be referenced.
1. Each account is based on the testimonial statements of castaways and contemporary miscellaneous records that documented interviews with these castaways.
1. What the castaways said cannot be said to be without error when viewed from today's perspective. Place names of where they drifted ashore, as well as customs, birds and beasts, plants and trees, etc., will be examined with illustrations inserted in the final volume, so individual corrections are not made here.
1. The writing primarily aims to directly transcribe the facts and deliberately avoids using speculative language.

After passing about fifteen chō, there was another river. The stone bridge spanning this river was made from a single stone about twenty ken long with seven drainage holes carved through it. Past this point, there were about twenty chō of bustling townhouses, and beyond that was the entrance to the castle. The castle was built against a mountain and was particularly high. After passing about fifty chō of stone walls made of large stones, a large building with a thatched roof that appeared to be a government office came into view. When the group reached this point, cannons were fired, which greatly startled the four men, and their ears stopped working for the day. When they were taken down from the planks here, perhaps due to their severe shock, they could not walk. However, the people who had brought them seemed unaffected, probably because they were accustomed to hearing it, and seeing the condition of the four men, they laughed heartily and helped them walk by taking them by the hands, two people to each castaway. This place, they were told, was the capital of Taiwan, a country that had recently been conquered and subdued by Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong).

From here, they passed through a large circular gate made of stone and earth, then came to another gate of the same shape carved from large stone, with stone doors as well. There were three gates in total,

each with guard posts on both sides. Once inside, tiled mansions could be seen here and there. The entire group was brought out to a large courtyard paved with cut stone. In front of them sat three high officials wearing magnificent various textiles, seated on three-legged curved stools. Four armored men attended each official, and outside the curtains, several men stood guard holding unsheathed spears and halberds. Both the spears and halberds were different from Japanese ones, being whitish gold in color and dazzlingly bright, but these appeared to be merely for intimidation rather than actual cutting.

Here they brought out three sheets of Chinese paper, and on each they wrote "Japan." After a while, they presented one sheet each to the men on the curved stools. All three men spread their hands wide and raised them high, and then the people sitting in rows also raised their hands. This gesture was the same as what they had seen when they pointed to Japan on the map earlier, but they could not understand what kind of ritual this was or what it meant. To the castaways, it seemed quite strange.

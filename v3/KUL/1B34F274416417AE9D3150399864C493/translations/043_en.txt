The village headmen and elders wore things like shoes or sandals. With these headmen present, they seemed to be asking the four men something, but since the languages did not communicate at all, they wrote "Japanese" in grass script with red ink to show them. However, the locals appeared completely unable to read it, so they added kana characters, but they could not read these either. They then wrote in regular script, but when they still could not read it, they gave up and set it aside, whereupon all the locals laughed heartily. The locals then cut gray silk about four shaku wide into eight pieces, wrote some worm-like characters in red ink, and posted these at the entrance of the house. They captured the eight villains who had initially stripped the clothing with a large group, rubbed their noses, bound their hands and feet like monkeys, attached something to their foreheads, assigned four guards to each one, and from time to time rubbed their noses to make them cry—this appeared to be punishment for their wrongdoing, which seemed both amusing and satisfying. Then they apparently sent a large group to guard the main ship, while about one hundred people attended the four men, gave them back their original clothing,

While doing all this, the day came to an end, so they brought out four bedding sets made of leather like futon, each about one jō by eight shaku in size, for them to sleep on. Throughout the night they kept pine torches burning and massaged their hands and feet to help them sleep—their manner of ensuring the castaways felt no fear and were at ease was the height of simple kindness and lovability. Thus, the distress that everyone had felt this morning when the eight villains stripped their clothing had now completely vanished, and they felt nothing but pleasure.

After spending the night there, five more headman-like figures and about two hundred villagers came and did another curious thing. They placed each castaway on a single plank about three ken long, nine shaku wide, and four to five sun thick, and carried them with a large group—this was no different from the procession of a portable shrine at a rural festival. Moreover, in every village they passed through, they were offered sake and dumplings, with many spectators lining both sides of the road, looking on with great curiosity.

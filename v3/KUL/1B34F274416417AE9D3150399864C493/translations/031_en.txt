Some spread them out to sleep on.

1. In the place called Manakoyohi on the island, there are seven to eight hundred houses, and in the place called Yuki, there are five hundred houses. Manakoyohi and Yuki had a conflict and fought, with both sides making armor from cowhide and wearing helmets carved from wood shaped like bowls.

Thinking that if they could not board that ship today, when would they ever get the chance to return, they all wept, but there was nothing they could do about it.

The ship captain, a man named Jiroubei, had gone somewhere and had not been seen since around the third month. When they asked the master about this, he answered that Jiroubei had gone out to the fields and had not returned.

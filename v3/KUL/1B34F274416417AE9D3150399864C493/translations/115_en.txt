The prices at this time were: rice about one shō (our country's measure) for twelve Chinese coins, and sake for about twenty-four coins. The sake had a taste more pungent than our country's roasted sake, with an aroma that pierced the nose, almost undrinkable for us. Fine cotton cost about fifteen coins per shaku (equivalent to about one shaku five sun in our country). Annam coins had the same shape as our country's bird-eye coins, with characters like "Seiwa Tsūhō" and "Taihei Tsūhō." The quality and color of the base metal were poor and easily breakable. According to Chinese people, they are made by mixing zinc. Chinese coins were also widely mixed in and used in circulation. These had good base metal quality and are coins frequently seen in our country as well. According to this country's system, sixty coins equal one hundred coins, so one kan equals six hundred of our teisen coins.

When Ton Tai Kun Shi brought four to five hundred kan of zinc from China to sell locally and received twelve thousand kan in coins, the seven castaways were also asked to help with stringing coins for four to five days. The coin strings were twisted from rattan. All currency consisted only of coins - even major transactions were counted in thousands or tens of thousands of kan, with no circulation of gold or silver

This country's main product is sugar, followed by pepper, cattle horns, cattle hides, ivory, aloes wood, shark products, medicinal materials, and other items like peacocks, parrots, crows and similar birds, and long-tailed beasts resembling cats. When they saw an elephant, its tusks appeared very small, but when they saw extracted tusks prepared for sale, they were four shaku long with a circumference of about nine sun.

When people of this country show respect to others, they invariably stand up, interlock their fingers with both hands, bend at the waist and bow their heads. The sword handles, fittings, menuki, tsuba, scabbards and such are made the same as in our country. The scabbard wrapping is not done with metal bands like our san-do construction, but the handle and scabbard are tied with cord at both ends and hung from the left shoulder to the right hip. Since the upper garments have no belt, there is no belt-wearing of swords. Razors are like small knives, with horn handles attached to the back, with the handle curved around to form a sheath. Chinese people's razors appear to be made the same way. Footwear has leather soles with woolen cloth or satin uppers, and wooden clogs have thong straps like in our country for the feet

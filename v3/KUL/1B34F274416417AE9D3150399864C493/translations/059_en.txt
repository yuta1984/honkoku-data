wondering when they would face the suffering of starvation, the extent of their hardships was truly impossible to fully express in writing or speech. Now the frost month had already passed, and it had become early December, but there was not even a cloud that might be mistaken for land. Day by day they simply followed the wind, sailing toward the southwest, between west and south.

Tonight would pass and the year would change, but for those who were adrift, there seemed no prospect of when they might return to their homeland. Feeling even more sorrow, everyone lay their pillows side by side, doing nothing but weeping in sadness. Dawn broke on New Year's Day of the Year of the Monkey. Though the sky's appearance differed from yesterday, the only thing unchanged was their suffering condition. Everyone groaned at the bottom of the boat, beneath their labored breathing

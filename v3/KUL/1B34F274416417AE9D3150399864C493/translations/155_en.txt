wore it, with a peach-colored silver mohair tube-sleeved overcoat with red pearl buttons, trousers of the same material, and a navy brocade undergarment, wearing black Harumiya leather boots over stockings on his feet, and carrying a rattan walking stick. Isokichi was similarly attired with only minor differences, wearing a silver tablet, a navy tromène overcoat with silver buttons, and velvet undergarments with yellow and black striped velvet trousers. Since such appearance was unusual for the time, it was natural that people commented to each other, "What strange attire there can be!"

Now, these two men - ship captain Daikokuya Kodayu and sailor Isokichi - were originally from Minamiwakamatus village in Kawakuma district of Ise Province. They had loaded castle rice for the Kishu domain aboard the ship Jinsho-maru owned by one Hikobee from Shirako village in the same province. With fifteen crew members including the captain and sailors, plus one supervisor and one assistant from the Kishu domain, seventeen people in total boarded and departed from Shirako port on December 13th of Tenmei 2, year of the water tiger (110 years ago), heading for Edo. Unexpectedly, they encountered a great storm off Suruga, with high waves that broke the rudder. As the ship seemed about to sink at any moment, they threw away the cargo and cut down the mast.

With great difficulty they weathered the wind and waves, but on the following 14th day they were blown toward Izu Oshima, and from around noon of that same day, no mountains could be seen anymore. From then on, day after day they drifted southeast with westerly winds. On the 20th of the same month, the wind changed to northeast, so everyone aboard rejoiced greatly, thinking they might fortunately be blown toward the Izu region. However, the tidal currents were unfavorable and things did not go as hoped - that night the wind became westerly again, carrying them away to the southeast. With no rudder or mast, there was nothing they could do but drift wherever the current took them, with no choice but to wait for better times. They had only the remaining 150 bales of rice left behind, and fortunately they had loaded bamboo for the estate, so they did not lack for fuel. They made holes in the deck structure to catch rainwater, filtered it through cotton, cooked meals of dark rice, and after about eight months, on July 15th of the following year, one crew member named Ikuhachi died of illness. However, since proper funeral rites were impossible aboard ship, they all gathered to chant Buddhist prayers and gave him a sea burial, which was truly pitiful. The hardships during this period can hardly be described in words.

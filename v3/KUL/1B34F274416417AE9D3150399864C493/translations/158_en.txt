Very well then. After arriving at that place, they were handed over to the magistrate. Kōdayū remained at the magistrate's residence, while the eight others were lodged at an inn with one official, one doctor, and two soldiers assigned to them. For food, the magistrate's office initially provided something like wheat flour, but later sent beef, milk, and such. Since these were unfamiliar foods, they returned them, whereupon they were given dried fish instead. Unfortunately, the area was suffering from famine at the time, with many dying of starvation, so perhaps the magistrate's office was also having difficulty with food supplies. Each day, the eight men were given beef and one gō (cup) of rice each, which was utterly insufficient, leaving them so hungry and exhausted they could barely walk. At this time, following the innkeeper's instruction, they peeled off the outer bark of cherry trees and ate the sweet inner bark. The magistrate kindly consoled them, saying that if they could endure until May, they would be able to catch many river fish. While they patiently passed their days, perhaps unable to endure this poor diet, between April 5 and May 6 of the eighth year, Yosamatsu, Kanjūrō, and Tōzō died of illness. With one person gone, then two, their numbers steadily decreasing, they thought that someday they too would meet the same fate, and found themselves weeping into their travel clothes. This area was extremely cold, and everyone traveled on the frozen river surface, with dogs pulling sleds.

Then came May, bringing some warmth, the ice on the rivers melted, and they caught many large fish called "chetcha" that resembled salmon, which finally gave them hope of survival. On June 15 of the same year, accompanied by officials and foot soldiers, they left this place, traveling by river boat and on horseback over mountain paths, arriving at a place called Chikiri about 370 ri distant. There, Kōdayū and all the others were given some silver coins, and on August 1 they again set sail from the same place, crossing 800 ri of ocean to arrive on the 30th at a port called Okhotsk. During this time, their food ran out at sea, and for about three days even water became scarce.

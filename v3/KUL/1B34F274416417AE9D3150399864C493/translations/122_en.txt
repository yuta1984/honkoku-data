Oral testimony given by these three men:
Regarding ourselves, twenty-one years ago in the year of the boar, we encountered a violent storm and drifted to an uninhabited island. This time, having departed from the country by means of a transport vessel, we hereby report one by one, as requested in your examination, the circumstances of our survival while drifting and staying on the island, the conditions of the island, and the circumstances of this transport vessel.

Item 1: As shown by the travel permit we possess from the Shimoda checkpoint, we are indeed sailors of Tsutsuyama Gohei's ship from Arai, Enshū.

At that location, a man named Gonshirō joined as a passenger, so we were again twelve people aboard [Upon reflection now, when going down to Naka-Nanbu, one supervisor disembarked at Sendai Arahama, so we arrived at Nanbu with eleven people, then became twelve again]. We departed from there, entered Kotake Bay in Sendai, departed from there on the 26th day of the 11th month of the same year, sailed progressively until we reached Kujūkuri in Bōshū.

However, on the last day of that month we encountered violent winds and were blown far offshore. The waves and wind gradually became stronger, making it very difficult to maintain the ship, so we abandoned the mast and drifted at the mercy of the elements for one day and night. The speed at which the ship drifted seemed truly faster than an arrow. At that time, although we all tried to sit securely inside the ship, we were knocked down by the drifting motion, so we all lay prostrate. As night turned to dawn and the wind gradually subsided, we all got up and looked in all directions, but the sea stretched endlessly with no landmarks visible anywhere, and then...

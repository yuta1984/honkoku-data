However, the wind was so strong and would not abate at all, so wanting to somehow anchor the ship, they dropped anchor, but the seabed was too deep for the anchor rope to reach. They then connected two anchor ropes of eighty fathoms and lowered it again, but it was still too deep to reach bottom. While struggling with this, the terrible wind did not cease, and the ship seemed to be blown eastward for about five ri. "This is a disaster! We cannot tell how far we'll be blown," they said, and all fifteen men cut their topknots and chanted in unison, "Namu Kairyu-o (Hail, Sea Dragon King), quickly calm the wind and let us return to our homeland." But the wind grew ever stronger, and the ship flew faster than an arrow, so they realized they could not remain safe. To reduce the wind resistance even a little, they cut down the great mast. Even so, the ship's eastward drift was still faster than sailing with full sails. During this time, from the dawn of the fourteenth day, the wind gradually began to weaken, so on the fifteenth day they cut the sail yard to use as a mast, took the rudder, and rowed directly westward.

At this time, the drinking water aboard ship was completely exhausted, and suffering from thirst beyond measure, they all gathered their knees together to discuss: "Once, in a drought year, we prayed for rain to the Kannon of two temples in Bishu - Ryuzenji and Jinshuji - and it was effective. This time too, if we pray from afar to these Kannon for rain, surely there will be divine efficacy." From then on, they all offered prayers. The ship captain Jirobei said, "I have often heard that even seawater is made of water vapor, so if we extract that water vapor, it will certainly become drinking water. Let us try it." He put seawater in several pots and arranged it so the steam would not leak out, and dew accumulated in buckets - about two sho of water at a time. During this time, perhaps their prayers were answered, as rain also began to fall, so they no longer lacked for water. For fuel, they had the mast they had cut down, and various tools aboard ship suitable for firewood, so they thought it would be sufficient for fifty to seventy days.
The next day, they gathered again to discuss: "In this condition, spending so many days at sea..."

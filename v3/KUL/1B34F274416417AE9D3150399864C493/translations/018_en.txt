The fifteen men had spent half a year under foreign skies, and it was already the fifth month of the Year of the Rooster. They all thought that no matter what hospitality they received, nothing could compare to returning home. Even if they were to be killed, they should petition for repatriation. On the fifth day of the fifth month, a festival day in Ming China, they petitioned the magistrate's office. The response was that they would be allowed to return home as desired, but they should wait for further instructions. Everyone was satisfied and waited only for the day when the order would come. Time passed quickly, the tenth month with its winter showers ended before they knew it, and the beginning of the eleventh month arrived. On the fifth day of this month, they were summoned by the magistrate's office and given sheepskin clothing, undergarments, loincloths, hats, leather boots, and other items. They were told they would be repatriated around the tenth of the same month, so they rejoiced with great excitement.

Though all aboard exerted their utmost effort, they could make no progress forward or backward against the contrary winds. Using only a beam as a makeshift mast, they drifted by pulling ropes during brief intervals of calm. On the 18th of the same month, western winds blew with tremendous fury - with such force that they seemed capable of blowing away mountains. The waves surged violently, dancing up to the sky, and the seawater that crashed aboard made the ship like a water vessel. All hands bailed water for their very lives, barely avoiding sinking, but each time the wind and waves intensified, even their six anchors were chafed through. With the ship appearing ready to break apart at any moment, they realized this was far beyond human capability, and they could only entrust their lives and deaths to heaven. The entire crew cut off their topknots, threw the captain's short sword, mirrors, small knives, scissors and such items into the sea as substitutes for themselves, prostrated themselves before Buddha and the gods, and prayed desperately to be brought closer to land. But there was no sign of divine response, and they could only drift helplessly on the vast ocean, battered by mountainous furious waves. It was not that the captain failed to make effort, nor that the sailors were negligent, but when heaven's fortune does not favor you, there is nothing that can be done.

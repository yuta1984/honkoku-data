because of my own feelings stopped the ship at Shioya-no-hana and now caused everyone's hardship, there is no escaping that sin. At least as an apology to everyone, I will sink myself into the sea and be buried in a fish's belly. Come now, farewell." Before he could finish speaking, as he was about to leap and throw himself in, everyone was shocked and held him back, saying: "We do not think so.

They drew their wakizashi, sharpened their naginata, and working together dismantled it, boiling it with miso and roasting it to eat, using its meat to stave off hunger. However, with the food rice gradually diminishing, each person felt barely alive,

They departed, and with favorable winds they raised multiple sails and sailed day and night without rest. They traveled 1,500 ri over the sea without incident, and on the second day of the fifth month, they arrived at the great port of Jakarta, a Dutch territory. The port was surrounded by stone walls built for several ri, with a river mouth about eight chō wide. When they entered by ship, there were guard stations on both sides. At the river mouth, pillars like mooring posts were erected with crossbeams, normally kept closed. When they reported to the guard station, officials came out in small boats and opened the water gate. They attached long ropes to the ship's mast, brought out two horses from the shore, and pulled the ship in. They went upstream about three ri, transferred to a small boat, and reached a landing place. From there they were taken to a house in a city district of tens of thousands of households with busy traffic of carriages and horses, spent one night, and on the following third day had an audience with the governor of this region. The next day, the fourth of the fifth month, four men who appeared to be officials came and put Magoshichi on a small boat, rowing out toward the river mouth from which they had originally come. Looking carefully at both banks, there were artillery platforms constructed in various places, appearing very heavily fortified. This was probably to sink enemy ships.

When they reached the river mouth, there were hundreds of large ships unfamiliar to the eye. Among them, two large ships preparing to sail for Japan had large flags fluttering in the wind and looked like small mountains, much larger than the ship that had originally brought Magoshichi here. Each year they set the fifth day of the fifth month as the auspicious day for departure from this country to Japan, and the twentieth day of the ninth month as the day for departure from Japan. Also, once every three years, they send ships to the Netherlands homeland to deliver the total accounts of taxes and tributes to the king. This large ship had a capacity of 18,000 koku, with a crew totaling 153 people including the Captain, ship's master, clerk, doctor and seven others, ten black slaves, 134 sailors, and Magoshichi. At evening on the fifth day, they fired several cannon shots as a signal and cast off the anchor ropes. The Captain and others had quarters arranged on the upper deck, with each room locked with a door. For morning and evening meals, when a bell was rung to call them, each came out from their rooms and all gathered in one hall to eat, with music during the meal. The food consisted of barley rice cooked in two large copper cauldrons, and for vegetables, dried fish was given one piece each, uncooked.

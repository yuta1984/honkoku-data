Then in early March, the guards took the seven of them to a nearby place called the port of Karagani, where there was a ship with about ten sailors and helmsmen aboard, ready to set sail, and they were urged to board it. Since this was what they had been requesting all along, they thought it must surely be to take them to Japan, and boarded with joyful hearts. They set sail in the evening, and with a favorable wind, raised three sails and sailed south.

He brushed away their clinging hands and departed with the five to who knows where. Thus Magoshichi and Kogorou, the two remaining, were separated from their companions while living, and wondered what would become of them, grieving and lamenting greatly. But since there was nothing else they could do, thinking that perhaps the people who had been taken away might return, they waited day after day for a while. Now this land was the same as the first place, with a very warm climate. Therefore, it is said that even during winter, they never see snow or frost. That aside, waiting for those people who had been taken away to return,

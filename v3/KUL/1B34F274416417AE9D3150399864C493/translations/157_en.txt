Thereafter, they subsisted only on fish boiled in seawater and black lily roots boiled in water, mixed together to create something like white sake, and thus spent several empty years. This was around July of the third year after drifting to this island. One day a Russian ship arrived, but it was wrecked when it approached the shore. Everyone helped carry up the ship's materials and rebuilt it into a smaller vessel than before. They boarded together with officials who were leaving the island in rotation, departed on July 18, Tenmei 7 (Year of the Sheep), traveled 1,400 ri by sea (another text says 500 ri), and arrived at Kamchatka on August 23 of the same year.

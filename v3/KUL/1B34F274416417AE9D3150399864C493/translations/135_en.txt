We did not examine who brought how much, but after the death of a man called Sadayu, there was one ryo and two bu in small pieces wrapped in a paper that looked like a funeral offering from his belongings. We collected all the money and coins that the other men possessed and placed them in a hollow within a cave on that island. Since they were of no use, we left them abandoned for over twenty years. When we departed from that island this time, we found that the coins had all rotted and crumbled to pieces, and we picked out and brought the tarnished gold, presenting four ryo and two bu in small pieces that had turned blue-green with corrosion. We were then ordered to divide this among the three of us, taking one ryo and two bu each. Other items such as personal seals, short swords, and tobacco pipes that were on the island when we were cast adrift had rotted away at some point.

Another inquiry: Regarding the pots, kettles, unhulled rice that the three men loaded when departing from the island, and items made on that island, what happened to the large bird pelts?

First, the pots and kettles that we had used for many years on the uninhabited island were with us until we reached Hachijo Island, but when our boat reached Hachijo Island, we were so overjoyed that we rushed ashore competing with each other, and completely

trampled and smashed the pots and kettles to pieces. As for the large bird pelts, since twenty people were aboard the small boat at sea, and we had to raise and lower the sails, it was extremely cramped, and the bird skins got in the way, so we abandoned them on a small island we drifted to the day after departing from the uninhabited island. About two to of unhulled rice that we harvested on the island is currently being kept by the officials of Hachijo Island, and when the official ship departed, they informed us of this, so the rice remains on Hachijo Island. As for the amount of unhulled rice, it should be about two to or more, but since we did not measure it precisely, we cannot say exactly how much.

What these three men have stated above is consistent with the previous examination we conducted.

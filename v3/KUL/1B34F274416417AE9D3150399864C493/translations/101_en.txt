Tales of Japanese Castaways　Volume Two

Compiled and narrated by Ishii Tamiji

Sixth Tale: A person from Hitachi drifts to Annam, encounters compatriots, and returns home

Those who engage in seafaring make the vast ocean their home, and once they have untied the mooring rope and set sail, they cannot know in advance whether they will sink and be buried in the belly of fish, starve to death from lack of food and drink, or safely return home on the appointed day. Therefore, the danger of their profession is extreme. However, the joy of crossing to foreign lands thousands of ri away without a penny in savings, bringing back rare tales and strange stories that ordinary people have never even dreamed of hearing, and once again enjoying conversation and laughter at the family gathering—this pleasure can only be experienced by castaways who have narrowly escaped death. Here we can understand that life's greatest pleasures exist within the midst of great dangers.

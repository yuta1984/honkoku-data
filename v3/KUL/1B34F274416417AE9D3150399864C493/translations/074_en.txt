His topknot had grown out scraggily, his mustache had grown sparsely and thick, his face was dark from smallpox, his chin was thin and his eyes sunken, presenting such a strange appearance that the household members, both high and low, perhaps finding him curious, all gathered around to stare at him. While Magoshichi thought this hateful, he plotted in his heart to surprise them, and when he made his eyes round and twisted his mouth, some of the women and children burst into tears while others laughed, and the whole house resounded with commotion for a time. Then a person who seemed to be the master came out and talked about various things with the ship captain, and soon took Magoshichi to the area near the kitchen, gave him food, and kept him in this house as he was.

Now this house had over twenty family members, maids, and manservants. The master was called Taikonkwan, about thirty years old. His wife was called Hakinton, quite a beauty aged eighteen, who had married into this house this spring. The master's mother was an elderly woman approaching sixty, and his brother, as he was known, was called Kanhenkwan, a robust man of twenty-three or four. The family business was trading in kimono and cotton goods, and all store matters were handled by two head clerks named Souteki and Hyakofu.

In addition to thirteen other clerks, three men named Areshimo, Useri, and Kausen were all black people who were not permitted to eat their morning and evening meals in the same place as the others. Among the many maidservants, three named Hahikaran, Ukin, and Kokin were also daughters of black people bought from distant countries. Now they called Magoshichi by the name "Nihon" (Japan), and at first they communicated only through gestures to understand things, but as the Bon festival season approached and things became busy with many temporary workers, since language barriers made everything inconvenient, he was suddenly taught a few words. Among these, the first he learned were "Konsashyaa" [meaning "What is this thing?"] and "Teusashyaa" [meaning "to do" when asking "what are you doing?"]. After that he gradually learned more words and reached the point where he felt no inconvenience in daily use. Both the master and his wife were deeply compassionate and always treated their household members with pity, so Magoshichi also worked cheerfully together with the other manservants.

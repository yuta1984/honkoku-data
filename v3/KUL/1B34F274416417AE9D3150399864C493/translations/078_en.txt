Since it was difficult, they aimed two or three guns with their muzzles aligned from below and fired. Their aim was true, and they shot him down headfirst from the distant treetop into the valley bottom. After falling he lost consciousness, so everyone thought he had died and left him abandoned there. But after a while he revived, and despite his serious wounds, crawled out of the valley and escaped to who knows where. Now, this place primarily conducts business with black people, so Magoshichi naturally learned the Indian language without particularly studying it. Their numbering system goes: one is "shatou," two is "chika," three is "anhatsu," four is "rin," five is "son," six is "annon," seven is "ton'e" (also called "yattō"), eight is "harou" (also called "tarahan"), nine is "sankaa" (also called "zanhīran"), and ten is "satsuhoro." When Chinese people count things, they say: one (i), two (ru), three (zanna), four (su), five (u), six (ro), seven (chi), eight (ha), nine (kiu), ten (shi), hundred (he), thousand (chien), ten thousand (wan). Thus this year too, drifting on the waves of the floating world, it quickly became New Year's Eve of the twelfth month. Looking at the appearance of the houses that day, in the guest rooms they sewed together and hung Chinese printed cotton on the ceilings, hung cotton with the same pattern on the walls, and kept large lanterns lit at the gates until dawn.

They light them, close the gates, and celebrate the year's end. When dawn breaks on New Year's Day, from around the hour of the Horse (4 AM), everyone in the household changes their clothing, congratulates each other on the new year, and the master goes out carrying a lantern to make New Year's courtesy calls. Their congratulatory words are "Saramatsuta" spoken from outside, with "Horirou" answered from inside. Many visitors stick name cards at the gate. Also, relatives and family connections wait for the doors to open and enter inside, where host and guest face each other and recite these congratulatory words, then afterwards serve sake and food. Eating rice cakes on New Year's morning is no different from our country. Among those rice cakes are white ones and black ones. The manufacturing method is: first pound glutinous rice into powder, knead it with sugar water, steam it and pound it in a mortar, then either tear it into rice cakes or press it flat and cut it into squares. White cakes are kneaded with white sugar, black cakes with brown sugar. The New Year visits and other family interactions are reminiscent of Japanese townhouses. The March 3rd festival customs do not include diamond-shaped rice cakes. On May 5th, white glutinous rice is soaked in water, wrapped in bamboo leaves, and either boiled in sugar water or steamed in sugar water.

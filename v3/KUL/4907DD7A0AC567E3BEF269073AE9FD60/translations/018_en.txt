A guard-like person was assigned to me. They provided me with a mosquito net made of white hemp, about four shaku in size for one room 《Marginal note: The tailoring was the same as in Japan》, which I used at night. For food, I was given rice with fish and such three times daily. In the inner room of this house, I observed two or three Chinese official-like persons wearing patterned silk gauze clothing with red thread attached and wearing caps. At this place, I was allowed to walk within the compound, but was not permitted to go outside.

A Chinese official-like person brought a palanquin to escort me outside, making preparations. That same evening, they had me board the palanquin 《Marginal note: The palanquin was the same as before》 with an official-like person accompanying me. We traveled about ten chō along the town streets, and when I got out of the palanquin, there was a boat of about seventy koku capacity moored at the riverbank, with one mast and a tea-dyed cotton sail. When I boarded this boat, there was one captain-like person and three sailor-like persons. We immediately set sail, rowed about one chō along the river 《Marginal note: This river was about six to seven ken wide》, went out to sea, sailed north for about three days, entered a mountain inlet, and landed at a place called Zhapu in China.

- In late February of that Year of the Rabbit, I had landed at Macau in Guangdong, China, and in September of the same year

Around mid-October, a ship about six and a half ken long with two masts hung with white cotton cloth fragments arrived at this place. The captain-like person (marginal note: The captain's appearance and ship construction were the same as mentioned before - foreign) (marginal note: Everything was made in the same way, all painted black) came to the house where I was staying and appeared to negotiate with the master. At nightfall, using gestures, he indicated we should come to the ship. The master-like person and the captain went together to the beach, where about twenty men and women from the vicinity had come out to see us off. We boarded the main ship by small boat with the captain, where six sailor-like men were present. The next morning we departed from that place (marginal note: Food aboard the ship was generally the same as mentioned before) and sailed westward for about three days before reaching another shore, where the captain and I disembarked by small boat.

There we found the nine men I mentioned earlier had each been placed in front of houses in a village of about fifty households. I was taken to the house where Hatsutaro was staying, and when I inquired about the situation, he told me that Inosuke, Gisaburo, and Sosuke had been sent elsewhere about ten days after arriving at this place. At that time, they had requested that everyone be sent together, but only those three were sent away, while Hatsutaro, Shichitaro, Manzo, and Yaichi - five men - remained at this place. With my arrival, we now totaled six people at this location. I stayed with Hatsutaro for two days, but in late October, when the captain took both Hatsutaro and me to the beach, we requested that all five remaining men also be sent away together, but this was not agreed to.

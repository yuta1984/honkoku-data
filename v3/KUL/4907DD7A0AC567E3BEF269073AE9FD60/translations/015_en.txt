Hatsutaro alone was taken somewhere by small boat, while I remained on the ship by myself. We stayed anchored at this island for about thirty days, and daily I helped repair the damaged parts of the ship. Around late February, I was put on a small boat with one sailor-like person, traveled about one ri, and landed on the coast. I was told this place was called Kanton Ōmon (Canton Macau) within the Tang country (China).

One: From our departure from America in late November until our arrival at Kanton Ōmon in the Tang country in late February of the following Rabbit year, we were aboard ship for approximately ninety days.

One: After landing on the coast of Ōmon, accompanied by the sailor-like person, I was led from the waterfront through a town-like area with continuous houses numbering about 3,000 for about five chō.

We entered a house about eight ken wide and five ken deep. It appeared to be a ship merchant's store-like establishment with many baskets and boxes for tea, as well as bolts of chintz, woolen cloth and other textiles stocked up. Among the people, some had the appearance and clothing similar to foreigners, while others appeared to be Chinese. Their heads were shaven like monks, with a little hair left on top folded in three and hanging down the back, or some had their hair wound up. They wore hat-like objects as shown in the diagram, had long mustaches, and wore loose-fitting garments of silk and wool with wide sleeves, and loose trouser-like clothing, with shoes on their feet. Their appearance and clothing differed from the foreigners.

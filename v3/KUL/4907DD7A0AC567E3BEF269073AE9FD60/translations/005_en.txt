1. That foreign ship was built in the same manner as Dutch ships, approximately sixteen ken long and four ken wide, painted black with two masts. It had fifteen or sixteen sails of various sizes made of white hemp. In the middle of the ship were mounted two large cannons about the size of one-kanme tubes, and among the cargo we observed sugar and cosa (pepper).

1. The ship's crew numbered twenty-seven or twenty-eight men. Their appearance was white-faced with watery eyes, hair hanging down and tied back in sections of about five bu each, wearing headgear made of gauze or wisteria [with illustration of headgear] as shown in the figure. Their clothing consisted of woolen garments and velvet-like woolen tube sleeves and hakama-style trousers, and they wore leather shoes.

From the 13th day of the 10th month of the Year of the Ox when we began drifting on the ocean until around the 20th day of the 2nd month of the following Year of the Tiger when we transferred to the foreign ship, approximately 130 days had passed.

Regarding the calculation of days during our time on the ocean and journey to foreign countries, I kept count assuming one month had thirty-one days (large month) and the next had thirty days (small month). For distances, both on sea and land, I calculated one ri as thirty-six chō. I have heard that American land distances are somewhat longer than Japanese ones.

1. When we transferred to that foreign ship, what remained on our ship was approximately one hundred barrels of sake, eighteen barrels of sugar, fifty bales of salt, one hundred bales of raw cotton, and about fifty boxes of incense. Of these, the foreigners used their boats to transfer forty barrels of sake and eighteen barrels of sugar—these two items to the foreign ship.

I saw two or three places that had been destroyed. In Zhapu as well, about five hundred houses were destroyed, and construction work is currently being done on those sites. The guardhouses in the mountains were also destroyed, and many Chinese were killed. I heard from a Chinese interpreter that British ships had carried out this destruction in the previous year of the Tiger.

This place is also a prosperous location with many houses, and grains and other matters are the same as in Macao. However, there are no foreigners at all in this place, only Chinese people.

The above concerns the items I observed in America and China, which I report in response to your various inquiries.

This I received at Zhapu when I arrived there, and used during my stay and on the ship when returning to Japan.

First, one palm fiber mat
This was given to me to use as bedding on the ship when returning to Japan.

First, one thin rope

Of the 600 mon I received at Zhapu, this was the remainder after spending some. When I brought it back, it was confiscated at the Nagasaki magistrate's office, and in exchange I was given back 10 mon in Japanese coins.

This was given to me by the interpreter, saying it was tailored in the Japanese style and provided by the government office when I returned to Japan.

This was given to me as a container for miscellaneous items.

First, one box
I received this while staying at a wholesale merchant's place. The lid is inscribed "Zensuke of Nakamuraya, Hyogo Port, Settsu Province." This was written by Zensuke on the lid, and then a Chinese person rewrote it properly.

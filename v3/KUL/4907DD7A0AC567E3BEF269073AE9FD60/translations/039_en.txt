The English are fair-skinned with red hair, and their head shape and clothing are generally the same as Americans.

First, I saw an English steamship at this place. The shape of the ship was similar to other foreign ships, but this steamship was made entirely of iron and was slightly longer than other ships. From about the middle of the ship upward, there were handmade iron devices like waterwheels on both left and right sides. With these wheels, the ship could move freely without relying on sails, and the wheels operated by a mechanism powered by fire. When I observed this ship departing, I saw that inside the ship there were also two wooden wheels on the left and right corresponding to the external wheels, with the edges constructed like ladders. Before departure, when people climbed up onto the crossbars of the left and right internal wheels

and stepped on them, as these wheels turned, the iron wheels outside the ship naturally began to rotate as well. In the middle area between the left and right internal wheels, they burned coal (marginal note: called "Ogoheida," a type of stone), and above this there was a smoke stack about two ken in length. When smoke began pouring out vigorously from this stack, they stopped treading the internal wheels, and the iron wheels rotated well, propelling the ship forward as they turned.

First, with these wheels, they could travel freely across the ocean. Of course, they still used a rudder. Besides this, I saw many other foreign ships entering port at this place. Naturally, the ship equipment and the people all appeared similar among all foreign ships.

However, we sustained our lives with the sake, sugar, and stored water that had been loaded on the ship. Around the middle of the 12th month, we again faced severe water shortages and made vows to the gods. Mysteriously, the next night the waves calmed somewhat and heavy rain fell, so we made various arrangements to collect rainwater and survived our thirst. While continuing to drift on the ocean, we caught bonito and yellowtail fish, and also harvested oysters that had attached to the sides of the ship for food. Around the 14th or 15th day of the 2nd month of the following Year of the Tiger, while dozing, I dreamed that a foreign ship came and we boarded it, communicating through various hand gestures. Around the 20th of the same month, we spotted a foreign ship about one and a half ri to the west in the offing. That ship came toward us and lowered two boats.

What appeared to be foreigners, six men to each boat, boarded these boats, each equipped with three guns. They circled our ship two or three times, and two or three of their number boarded our ship and appeared to inspect the damaged parts of the vessel. They broke through the head boards of the sake and sugar barrels that were loaded aboard, inserted their fingers to examine them, found cotton bales, pulled out some cotton to examine it, then returned to their main ship. Soon they came back in the boats and used hand gestures to indicate they would rescue us. Therefore, all crew members took their clothing and possessions, boarded their boats, and went aboard the foreign ship.

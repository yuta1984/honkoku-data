Copy of the official document conveyed when the shogunate summoned our house's caretaker (rusuii)

Regarding Kōtayū and Isokichi from Minami-Wakamatsu Village, Kawawa District, Ise Province, in the domain of Lord Hyūga-no-kami: These men drifted to foreign countries but endured years of hardship and returned home safely, which demonstrates admirable resolve. Therefore, thirty ryō of gold each shall be granted to them. This time, by special arrangement, they will not be returned to their home village but will be kept here in Edo. As for their residence, they shall be housed within the medicinal herb garden in the vacant land of Banchō. As monthly stipends, Kōtayū shall receive three ryō of gold each month, and Isokichi shall receive two ryō each month. Both men may summon their wives at their discretion to live in peace. For now, they shall be kept without official duties. The Finance Magistrate (Kanjō-bugyō) shall oversee this arrangement. Lord Toda Uneme-no-shō conveyed that this matter should be communicated, so I hereby report this.

Tora year (1793), 6th month

I report this unusual matter. Being occupied with various duties, I cannot report to each individual person. Please excuse me.

This is what I understood.

1. Ships have no sculling oars, only using paddles.

1. This is said to be the emperor's villa, located twenty-seven ri away from the capital. The middle of this highway is paved with cut stones, and to the north there is a canal extending twenty-seven ri. Along the edge of the canal are iron handrails and something like horse barriers. To the south, similarly extending through, there are various potted plants - pines, camellias, sakaki, shikimi, holly, and such. Glass shoji screens are lined up, with an abundance of plants, creating a palace of such magnificent construction that it cannot be fully described even with a brush.

1. Within the capital, like in Edo, there is a great river, and on this river there are four stone bridges. These stones are polished stone, and the bridges are slightly larger than Edo's Ryogoku Bridge. For military purposes, these stone bridges are designed to be drawn to both sides. They are truly massive constructions, and all the mechanisms of this country do not appear to be human craftsmanship.

1. The scales have a hook attached to the middle of the rod, with scale pans attached to both sides of the rod. They put the item to be weighed in one scale pan and weights in the other to measure the kan-me. The weights have kan-me markings, and there are many varieties.

1. When the emperor makes a royal progress, even on regular thoroughfares, cut stones about one and a half ken wide are laid in the middle of the road. Common people from townhouses and lower classes cannot pass over these paving stones and must use both sides.

1. One sailor named Kotayu from Ise Province lives in this place, having received 250 pieces of gold from the emperor. He practices calligraphy and takes charge of fourteen or fifteen children learning to write, teaching them Japanese characters. Since this person served as our interpreter, he was given an additional 120 pieces of gold as a reward.

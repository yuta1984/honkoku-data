A ship belonging to Yonezu-ya Heinojo from Ishinomaki in Oshika District departed from Kawaguchi in the 11th month of Kansei 5 (1793). On the 29th of the same month, it was blown away from Japanese territorial waters and drifted to Russia, arriving on the 10th day of the 5th month of Kansei 6 (1794). Of the sixteen crew members including the captain and sailors, three people - Captain Heibei and two sailors - died of illness in Russia. Of the remaining thirteen, nine chose to stay in Russia of their own accord, while four were sent back to Nagasaki on an 81-person ship from that country. They departed from St. Petersburg, the capital of Russia, on the 10th day of the 6th month of Kyowa 3 (1803), arrived in Nagasaki on the 6th day of the 9th month of Bunka 1 (1804), and returned home in the 2nd month of Bunka 3 (1806). This is a record of their night-time conversations about their experiences, written down after they returned home following approximately fourteen years away.

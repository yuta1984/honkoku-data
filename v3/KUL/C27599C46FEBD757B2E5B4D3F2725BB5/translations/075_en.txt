Regarding the official business of dispatching Ito Seibee to Nagasaki

As we are dispatching Ito Seibee, I respectfully write this letter. Regarding the matter of the ship that drifted ashore at Kishiura, when we inquired with Lord Hikabe Tamba-no-kami and Lord Watanabe Gaiki about the matters we have been reporting repeatedly during this time, we received and acknowledged the circumstances of your being summoned by both lords from the 15th, along with the reply letter from Lord Tamba-no-kami and the written directive from Lord Gaiki that you sent us. Since this is a ship without proper credentials (shinpai), it should be dealt with by Lord Gaiki's orders. Lord Gaiki's written directive states to "understand as previously instructed," and we have acknowledged the detailed explanation that this definitively means expulsion. However, since there are no illegal matters involved, we are concerned that hasty expulsion might result in some procedural error, so we are dispatching Seibee as a messenger to make repeated inquiries. The details were communicated when we dispatched Takagi Zenemon yesterday, and we have also coordinated with Seibee, so if there are any unclear matters, please discuss and handle them upon his arrival. With utmost reverence and humility.

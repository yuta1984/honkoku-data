Regarding the six-article official document handed over by Lord Gaiki, response letters will be written and sent sequentially from here. (However, the original document is dated August 13th)

1. Regarding the credentials, we expect to receive word about them later.
When we conducted written conversation, they said that since it was a Jakatora (Jakarta) ship, they had not received information about credentials. Details of this matter were reported on the 12th, and copies of the written conversations were also submitted.

1. When they approached Nomozaki, no suspicious ships were seen, so was the expulsion measure postponed for that reason? Since it was during daytime, we surmise that it was postponed all the more for that reason.
Unlike drifting ships, when there is nothing suspicious and ships have unavoidably drifted ashore as before, the island guards from that direction meet them, receive reports of the situation, and when written documents are submitted, they accept them and report to the castle town. Then officials are sent from the castle town to conduct written conversations, inquire whether they possess credentials, and this information is sequentially reported to the Nagasaki Magistrate. On that occasion as well, personnel from Himeshima guard station met them, received written documents, and reported to the castle town. Accordingly, officials were sent from the castle town as usual to conduct written conversations and sequentially report the situation to your region.

1. Did the Chinese ship submit documents and have guard ships assigned? How close to land did they approach?
As mentioned in the previous article, while guard ships were assigned to watch over them, the Chinese ship submitted documents.

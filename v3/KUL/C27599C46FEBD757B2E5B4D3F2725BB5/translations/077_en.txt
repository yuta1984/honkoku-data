However, the content of the separate document lists the names of officials dispatched from the castle town regarding the circumstances of this drift incident, and details in a memorandum the circumstances of the Chinese ship that drifted to Karatome Bay the year before last, which did not carry official documents but was sent to various places following instructions as a ship entering Nagasaki port.

Oral statement to Lord Tamba-no-kami that Seibee should keep in mind
Memorandum of oral statement

Regarding the Chinese ship that drifted to Kishiura in Lord Matsudaira Hizen-no-kami's domain, when we first made inquiry, since it was a ship without official documents, Lord Gaiki would issue instructions. The details were communicated to Tokunaga Yajiemon as heard, and we have fully understood and reported the content that was communicated to Yajiemon through your written orders. Lord Gaiki reportedly told Tokunaga Yajiemon that since this ship did not carry official documents, if there were no instructions from the magistrate regarding forwarding it, they should understand to expel it. The Chinese ship that drifted this time differs from bad drifting vessels and has nothing suspicious about it. It appears to be a ship that drifted ashore unavoidably due to rough seas, and there is nothing unlawful about it. If it is determined that there is no need to bring it to that port, should it not be ordered to return directly from where it drifted ashore, and only if it drifts ashore like a bad ship should it be ordered to be expelled? Of course, from the written communication during this time, it appears that the mast was damaged. If that is truly the case, might it be difficult for it to return directly? That point is difficult to calculate. The details of this matter should be reported fully and inquired about repeatedly.

The ship was damaged and drifted ashore, with sixty-five people on board.

1. Since this is a ship bound for Nagasaki as stated above, regarding whether we should escort it there according to instructions, we have sent a letter from ourselves to the chief retainers of Lord Hizakabe Tango-no-kami and Lord Watanabe Geki. We are also sending a draft copy for reference.
Please present this letter and state the contents of the document orally, then send word of the instructions with utmost haste by courier.
Lord Nagakiyo will also send a letter to Lord Tango-no-kami and Lord Geki, which should also be brought along.

1. If the instruction is indeed to escort this Chinese ship, then according to precedent, we would take Chinese people as hostages, put them on our ships, and escort the vessel with tow boats.
Furthermore, the written dialogue indicates they lack water and firewood, so I have ordered that water and firewood be provided gradually. Should they also desire vegetables and such, may we provide these as well?
Please inquire with Lord Tango-no-kami and convey his instructions.

1. We are sending four copies of the written questions and answers from the bilateral dialogue. The original papers with the Chinese responses should be submitted to Lord Tango-no-kami. We are also sending four copies for submission to Lord Geki.

1. Please also inform Takagi Kanbei and Fukuda Jūrōzaemon of these matters.
With great respect and deference.

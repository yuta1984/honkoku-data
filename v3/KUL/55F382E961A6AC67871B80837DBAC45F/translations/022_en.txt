Along the route, there are no particularly high mountains, mostly flatlands with rivers, but since they are all frozen, they cross over them. In summer, they sometimes encounter several days of river blockages, as I have heard. In this area, winter is extremely cold, so everyone stays shut up in their dwellings. Among them, those of low status or horse drivers sometimes work outside, and such people suffer from swollen and painful faces, which become putrid and unsightly when spring comes and it gets warmer. From this place onward, there are horse relay stations along the road, spaced at intervals of twenty ri, thirty ri, or fifty to sixty ri, sometimes even a hundred ri apart. On something like a snow cart, they attach a box in which about two people can get in, and this cart is pulled by two horses,

three horses, or at distant relay stations, even four or five horses, pulling day and night. Wind bells are attached to these horses, and when they arrive at relay stations, the sound alerts them to bring out fresh horses. Of course, sometimes these carts are also changed at relay stations, but the carts the castaways ride in are continuous-journey carts, with only the horses being changed. From this area, there is a large river whose name I have forgotten, and they mostly travel along the riverbank or sometimes over land. Of course, in summer this river has boat traffic, and people mostly travel back and forth by boat, but at that time (winter), the river water is frozen solid, so they are pulled over it by cart. From this river to a place called "Erikātsuka" is about 2,500 ri, and at narrow places, it would be more than three ri in Japanese measurements, while at wide places, the opposite shore cannot be seen.

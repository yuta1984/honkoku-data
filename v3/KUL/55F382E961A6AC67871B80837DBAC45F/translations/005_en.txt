　On September 3rd, 1804 (July 29th by the Japanese calendar), [we] arrived at "Kamchatka," 
　and on September 10th of the same year (August 7th by the Japanese calendar) departed from the same location. After 
　31 days at sea until today, [we] have landed safely without incident. There are 
　no other similar vessels besides this one ship.
Item 1: Regarding the envoy officials who have come this time, [they] are from the Russian sovereign
　carrying a letter of credence to Edo as well as a copy for the magistrate,
　as stated upon [their] arrival. When [we] told them to submit said correspondence to the offshore inspector,
　[they replied that] the original document was to be brought to Edo by the envoy for presentation, while the copy was to be submitted at the magistrate's office, as 
　commanded by the sovereign, and therefore it would be difficult to entrust it to any other authority.

　Accordingly, when [we] inquired about the general meaning of said letter of credence, [they stated that] in previous years
　[they] received a credential in Ezo territory, and in order to express gratitude for this, [they] now come with an envoy
　to present tribute and pay respects in Edo, and beforehand wish to establish
　diplomatic relations with [our] country at this location, and also have
　requests regarding matters of trade.
Item 1: Of the 85 crew members aboard this vessel, there are 4 Japanese and 81
　Russians, with no other crew members. Regarding these Japanese, [they]
　drifted to Russia 12 years ago, so [the Russians] have brought them along. The
　Russian naval officer reported this matter. This concerns the main intent of the letter presented by the sovereign, [regarding] the Russian [mission that] has now come to court.

This person had drifted ashore and was sent to Matsumae in the year of the ox. His birthplace was Shiroko in Ise Province, and he was called Shinzō from the same place, who had drifted together with Kōdayū. He had now become a Russian official and changed his name to "Nikolai Haitruichi." He had taken a woman from that country as his wife and had children as well, he told us. When he asked about conditions in Japan, we gave appropriate responses. Later, we also went to visit this man's house, which was about three or four ken in size, where he lived with his wife and children—five people in total—and he said he had no servants. While staying with the aforementioned envoy, there was an instruction from the king, and they made for us bedding, undergarments, and rain gear resembling cappa.

We received these gifts. Then we went to the magistrate's office, and during our stay there as well, as hospitality from the king, we were given food including bread, pork, fish, sake, etc., twice daily. During the approximately one and a half months we remained there, we went sightseeing to various places by carriage with officials accompanying us, but they would not let us go to distant places. On those occasions, we went to see theatrical performances twice, but we could not understand them at all. While this was happening, around mid-June of the same year, we were ordered by the magistrate to board a ship that would take us back to Japan by sea. Moreover, as gifts from the king, each of the four of us was given one tan of woolen cloth. When we went to the harbor that same day, the six men who had remained in that country came to see us off.

The doctor said he would take him to his own house to provide medical care, and Denzō, since Jūsuke was like a younger brother to him, offered to accompany and nurse him. Following this suggestion, Denzō and Goemon accompanied the patient to the doctor's house, which was about half a ri away. This doctor was a farmer who also took care of their meals, so Denzō and Goemon stayed at the doctor's house to provide nursing care.

The medicine was a decoction, not tea, but something like Japanese tea prepared with water, and leaf-like substances soaked in water were used as poultices applied to the body. However, his condition gradually worsened, and the treatment proved ineffective. He passed away in the first month of the year of the horse, six years ago.

When they informed the people in the neighborhood, they helped with the arrangements. The body was placed in a coffin, and the Hawaiian people along with all of us carried it to a small elevated area about five or six ken from the house, where the landlord's family cemetery was located, and buried him there.

At that time, a person who had come from America—not a monk but someone dressed like a Buddhist priest—came and chanted something, though we could not understand it. There was no stone pagoda, but they erected something made of wood resembling a Japanese sotoba, with Western letters written on it, though we could not read these either. Erecting such wooden markers was said to be Hawaiian custom.

Afterwards, the three of them—Denzō, Toraemon, and Goemon—continued working together. Around October of the same year, as I recall, they learned that a whaling ship from New Bedford in North America, named the Rodeae with a captain called Cookun and a crew of twenty-five, was heading to Japanese waters for fishing. They therefore sought passage on this vessel to return home.

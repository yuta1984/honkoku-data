The examination was conducted as requested.

Regarding this matter, during our stay in foreign countries, we of course did not study Christianity or similar religions, nor were we ever encouraged to do so, and we had absolutely no inclination toward such things. Should anything we have concealed come to light from external sources, we accept that any punishment whatsoever may be imposed upon us.

Regarding whether we had loaded weapons aboard, whether we possessed gold and silver money, and whether we engaged in any trade-like activities during our stay in that country, we were examined and ordered to provide complete details. Concerning this matter, when we departed from our home province, we loaded no weapons and brought no gold or silver money. During our stay abroad, apart from procuring food with the silver money we received as wages, we absolutely did not engage in any trade-like activities.

We were examined regarding whether we possessed travel permits, protective amulets, and such. Concerning this matter, when departing from our home province, since we were fishermen, we had requested and received from the village headman a permit for Denzō stating that we were going out for fishing purposes with a crew of five, so that we could visit any coastal areas without impediment. However, this was lost when our ship was wrecked, and we did not carry any protective amulets or similar items.

We were examined regarding whether we had received gold, silver, clothing, and other items. Concerning this matter, the gold, silver, clothing, and other gifts we received have been brought back and confiscated as detailed in the separate document submitted.

All of the above is stated without any discrepancy whatsoever.

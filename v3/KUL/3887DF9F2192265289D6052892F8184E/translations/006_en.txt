They rowed closer, and when all of us gained strength and continued waving, we saw they were foreigners. Each boat had six men aboard, and among them was one person whose appearance was different from the others—he was dark-skinned. They all wore tube-sleeved clothing and hakama-like trousers, and wore hats. When we gestured for help, the foreigners seemed to understand, but due to the rough waves they could not come close. The foreigners gestured for us to swim out and board their boats, so Manjirō, Toraemon, and Goemon swam out and climbed aboard. We further indicated through gestures that two more men were sick in the island cave and asked for help, which they also seemed to understand. Manjirō and Goemon boarded one of the small boats and immediately returned to the main ship, while Toraemon was left on one of the boats.

One of the six foreigners swam to shore and came to the rock cave, indicating through gestures that he wanted to accompany them. Denzō and Jūsuke were startled and called out, but the language did not communicate. After some time, this foreigner carried Denzō to the water's edge. At that moment, a small boat arrived with Toraemon aboard—seeing each other for the first time in this situation, they rejoiced. The foreigner returned again and brought Jūsuke. A rope was thrown from the small boat, and grasping this rope, they were pulled up and immediately rowed back to the main ship. Before seven o'clock in the evening, they boarded the main ship and all five were reunited. There, what appeared to be the ship's captain questioned them about something, but they could not understand the words. However, it seemed they understood that we were Japanese people, and that we had been shipwrecked and stranded on the island.

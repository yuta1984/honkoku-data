They raise ducks and other birds, and I observed that cattle and horses are also kept. Both cattle and horses appeared to be fat and well-fed. Most cattle are reddish in color and used for food. Horses are also used for food, but they do not kill them for eating—only those that die naturally are consumed. Additionally, there are many types of birds not commonly seen in Japan. Pigs, dogs, cats, and other animals were also observed.

Regarding climate: The land has moderate temperature throughout the year. The harbor faces south and is quite warm, though the heat is not unbearably intense. Overall, it is warmer than Japan. Light clothing is worn throughout all four seasons. In spring and summer, easterly winds blow frequently. Around November and December, there is much rain, but no snow falls. There is no thunder or earthquakes, and the castaways experienced none during their stay on the island.

Regarding industry: There are merchant houses that raise and trade sheep, pigs, chickens, cattle, and other livestock. The merchant houses in a place called Horereba are quite prosperous, with seventeen or eighteen shops that sell fish, vegetables, and various other goods—each store handling multiple types of merchandise. Besides these, there are also fabric shops, inns, and fishermen who engage in fishing. Their fishing methods include net fishing and angling, which do not differ much from those in Japan. Since Oahu produces no materials suitable for clothing, they engage in trade for various goods at the harbor when ships from China, France, England, and other countries arrive. When foreign ships dock, washing clothes and similar services become women's work. Women living in small houses weave hats and mats using something called "akakaito." Wives of men of appropriate social standing do not engage in any handicrafts.

Regarding agriculture: There are fields in the mountains and flatlands, but no rice paddies.

remained unchanged.

1. Regarding the climate: The heat was extremely intense, and June and July were almost unbearable. However, because of the high mountains, snow could be seen on the peaks. It was an irregular place where many people became ill.

1. The only industry was gold mining; there were no other industries. People gathered from various places and freely dug for placer gold, but since each location was held by contract, if one found a good spot for oneself, others were not allowed to dig there carelessly. As for digging tools, there were no merchants in this place, so if one bought from private individuals, the prices were high. Manjiro had bought digging tools while staying in New Haven. They included items like Japanese crane beaks - the tip was iron and the handle was wood. The hoe was square with a wooden handle attached, similar to Japanese hoes. The hand bucket was what they called a three-sho capacity container with iron rings, made of tin work, and items like Japanese winnowing baskets - all together costing ten silver coins, which he bought and brought from New Bedford. The placer gold dug out at the riverside was immediately taken to the river, where the winnowing basket-like tool was used to shake off the sand inside, repeatedly sorting and washing to extract the gold. In the mountains, he would take it to lakes or ponds and do the same. Places with placer gold generally had a golden quality, and if one dug from three feet to about one ken deep, gold would appear. Initially, what was dug out was exchanged for silver coins daily at Kitagawa Inn.

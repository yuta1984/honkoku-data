There were about [three hundred houses]. When they went ashore, the houses were thatched with grass, similar to those in Hawaii. Farmland was also visible, and they stayed for about thirty days, took on firewood and water, and departed from that place. Sailing toward the southeast direction, they fished in various places while returning near Kian Island and fished in the open ocean. In February 1843 (equivalent to the first month of Tenpō 14, year of the Rabbit), they anchored at that island, purchased firewood, water, and food, and stayed for about thirty days. Departing from that place, they sailed southeast while fishing and caught about seven or eight whales. After several months, in 1844 (equivalent to February to March of Kōka 1, year of the Dragon), they arrived at New Bedford in Massachusetts, North America.

The harbor entrance appeared to be about three ri long and one ri wide, with what seemed to be about five to six thousand houses. About two hundred whaling ships were anchored there. About three people came from land to my ship as replacements, and the captain and all the sailors went ashore. When we also went ashore accompanying the captain, this place was a prosperous town where only sailors and merchants resided, all with board-roofed houses with proper fixtures. After walking about one chō, we came to an entrance where gates continued.

The river width was about fourteen chō. There was a large shoal in the middle, and from the riverbank to the shoal was about five chō on each side, with stone embankments built in various places and bridges spanning across them. When large ships passed through, the bridges would be raised, we were told. Crossing that place, we were told it was called New Haven. We were taken to the captain's residence. This person lived with his wife, one son, one sister, and one servant—five people in total, with day laborers also coming to do work.

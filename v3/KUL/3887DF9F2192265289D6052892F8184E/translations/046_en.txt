[They] spread [leather] there, stretch out their legs and sit. At night they lie down to sleep in the sleeping quarters. There are also wells dug and built up with stones, with pump-like devices extending down to the water surface inside the wells, operated with wooden handles to draw up water. They heat this water in pots and bathe in tubs. During Manjiro's stay, there was a fire, but it was quite small, and the firefighting methods were the same as those used during fires on Oahu.

Regarding fortifications: No castle-like structures were observed.

Regarding the terrain: There are mountains, but mostly flat land. Pine trees and such can be seen, with the mountain foothills about three ri away. At the entrance to Honolulu harbor, about two hundred cannons are positioned defensively. The front ten or so fire iron and lead balls, with large cannons about eight sun in diameter and about two ken in length.

Regarding vegetation: There are no particularly large trees, but there are trees called "in" (similar to Japanese camphor trees), along with many pines and cedars. Other trees about five to six ken in height can be seen all around, and there is miscanthus grass as well. No other vegetation was observed.

Regarding birds and animals: Deer, cattle, and horses were observed, appearing somewhat larger than Japanese cattle and horses. Chickens, pigs, and sheep are kept by each household, and pigs were seen being sold at shops near the waterfront. No ducks were observed, but many other unfamiliar types of birds were seen, which they hunt with guns. An elephant from Africa was observed being displayed as an attraction.

Wishing to do so, they requested passage from the captain, who agreed. The three of them—Toraemon, Denzō, and Goemon—planned to board together, but Toraemon said he was afraid of being on the ship and preferred to remain behind, as living anywhere would be the same for him. Therefore, Denzō and Goemon boarded the ship, and in late October they departed from Hawaii heading south, stopped at an island called Kian, entered its harbor, and took on firewood and water. They stayed at this place for about two months.

In the first month of the year of the sheep, five years ago, they departed from the same place heading north, passed through Japan's Pacific Ocean, and in late March of the same year arrived in the waters near Matsumae to engage in whaling.

At that time, the captain told them this was connected to Matsumae territory. The main ship anchored about two ri offshore, and around the hour of the monkey in the afternoon (around 3 PM), they launched one ship's boat with one ship's officer as escort, six foreigners, and Denzō and Goemon aboard, and all went ashore on the northern coast of that land.

There they found fields planted with taro and other crops, and two crude huts measuring about nine shaku by two ken. When the foreigners went to these places, they found straw sandals and rope sandals hanging inside the houses, but despite searching the vicinity for dwellings, they encountered no people. They lit a signal fire on elevated ground and waited for some time for people to come, but no one appeared at all.

At that time, the captain said that since this was like an uninhabited island where they would face difficulties again, he would transport them to a suitable place in Japan. Although they had already landed and suggested they should search for inhabited houses, he said he would take them to an even better location.

The entrance was extremely narrow, and we could see about fifty whaling ships of various sizes moored there. There were also ships anchored outside the harbor. This island extended about fifty ri from north to south, with flatlands stretching about twenty ri from east to west, and we could see about a thousand houses.

After about thirty days had passed, we were told we could go ashore. All five of us were taken by the captain to what appeared to be a government office, where there was an official-like person called Alii Tsuhana. When we all bowed our heads together, he responded with greetings saying "Aloha, Aloha," which we learned was the custom of their country.

At that time, it was explained that we were Japanese castaways. Regarding Manjirō, since he was young, the captain would take him back to his home country to care for him, and might bring him back again later—this was apparently reported to the office. The other four were to be left in this place under their care. After conveying this message, we left the office and said farewell to Manjirō, who boarded the ship with the captain to return to America. After about three days, the ship departed.

The four of us were housed in a building about five or six houses east of that office—a thatched-roof structure about two ken by three ken with earthen-floor pillars. The wood used was called "hau," similar to paulownia. Many men and women had been living in that house, but on orders from the office, they moved to neighboring houses, and we four were placed in that house. For floor covering, they laid down tatami-like mats made from something called "akakai"—thick reed-like plants that grow along riverbanks, which were dried and woven together—over the earthen floor. Meals were provided three times a day, consisting of steamed taro and sweet potatoes.

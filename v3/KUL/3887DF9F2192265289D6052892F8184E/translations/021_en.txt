We arrived at San Francisco in California. The wide parts of the harbor appeared to be about eight ri, and the narrow parts about one ri, with what seemed to be about 1,500 to 1,600 houses. Ships from various states, roughly 2,000 vessels, were moored there, including one warship. It had cannons mounted in two tiers, with about seventy-four guns visible. I was told this was a North American warship. Regarding wages, sailors on all merchant ships were paid a monthly salary of seventeen silver coins each as standard, and I received wages according to that rate. I don't remember the exact crew number.

Since the gold mines were not particularly far from here, I told the captain that I wanted to go to places where placer gold could be found. I went ashore alone and stayed at a Chinese inn. Meals consisted of rice and about five kinds of side dishes including pork, beef, and fish, served three times a day. The lodging cost was equivalent to one and a half silver coins per day. After staying for about three days, I left that place and traveled about two chō to reach a river mouth where several coastal vessels were anchored.

I boarded a "slice hall" [marginal note: this refers to a steamboat] with a crew of over a hundred people, paying twenty-four silver coins per person as fare, and departed at five o'clock in the morning. The river flow was calm with varying depths, some places being as deep as thirty fathoms, and the river width was about one chō, with narrow sections of about half a chō. Mountains could be seen on both sides of the river, as well as plains. Lunch was provided by the ship owner, with the same kind of meals as the aforementioned inn, and for an additional two silver coins, extra food could be obtained as desired. We traveled about fifty ri upriver and arrived at a place called Sacramento around evening of the same day, where we disembarked.

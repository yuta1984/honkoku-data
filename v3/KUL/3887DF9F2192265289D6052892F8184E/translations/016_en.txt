Around October 1845 (corresponding to September of Kōka 2), when the ship departed, I tended to the captain's farm work and found it difficult to attend school daily, only occasionally going there to receive instruction. I had previously asked the captain about returning to Japan, but since there was no immediate opportunity, I thought that joining a fishing vessel might provide a chance to return to Japan. At that time, a whaling ship from New Bedford was about to depart, so I asked the captain named Devist to hire me as a sailor. The ship was called Franklin with a crew of twenty-eight men.

In mid-April 1846 (corresponding to late March of Kōka 3), we departed from New Bedford harbor, sailed around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa, passed through the waters near New Holland (Australia) and Java, and in October of the same year, moored our ship at Kupang in the Dutch-controlled Timor Islands.

Regarding this Timor Island, when I inquired with the resident Dutch people, they told me it was an island in the Indian Ocean, with its capital Kupang under Dutch control, while the rest belonged to Portugal.

We purchased firewood, water, and food, staying for about thirty days. This island appeared to be about the size of Kyushu in Japan, with an inlet of about five ri square serving as a harbor, and approximately two hundred houses. About ten merchant ships passing through the island were moored there. Upon landing, I found Dutch people residing there, many prostitutes present, and East Indians and Chinese people had also come there. In November, we departed from that place toward the waters near New Guinea.

Written report stating the particulars of inquiries made to the castaways regarding the conditions of the uninhabited island and foreign countries

Conditions of the Uninhabited Island

The terrain consists of rough rocky shores with a circumference of approximately one ri, where the tides ebb and flow just as in our home province. There is a single mountain with a climb of about five to six chō, with no flat land at the summit. The cave where we castaways took shelter faced south, and to the west there was flat land of about one chō where many birds resided. The northeast area was extremely treacherous. Although many fish could be seen around the island in the surrounding waters, we had no fishing equipment, and moreover the rough waves made fishing completely impossible on this land, as the ship captain who rescued us explained. Along the rocky shore there were no small stones, but many large round rocks. The appearance varied by location - much of it consisted of rock with high vertical cliffs and many dangerous spots, though there were also some slightly flat areas that were easier to descend. The cave had a round entrance about five shaku wide and extended about two ken square inside. There were many crabs, wood lice, and other creatures, and shore shellfish, but due to the rough rocks we could only gather small amounts daily, which we all ate as food. Around the second month when the tide was low, we were able to collect more. Among the shellfish were "crow's mouth" shells about two to three sun in size, as well as turban shells and limpets - all single-shell mollusks that attached to the rocks.

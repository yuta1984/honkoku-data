Fire prevention methods do not differ from those in Japan.

Regarding castle-like structures: None were observed.

Regarding the land: Within Oahu, at the place called "Honolulu" where the castaways resided, the coastline extends six to seven chō toward the mountains. East and west is flatland, generally open, with the ocean to the south. There are many mountains, including high peaks, with abundant hau and sandalwood trees. When whaling ships from various states enter port, it becomes quite bustling, but depending on the season, after they set sail it becomes lonely again. All gold, silver, and copper coins are brought from foreign countries, and these foreign gold and silver coins serve the nation's currency needs. One silver coin is equivalent to two kan-mon in Japanese currency.

Oahu consists of seven islands. The southernmost island is named Atokai, the northernmost island is Oahu, the middle island Morokai, then Mōhui Narabe, the large island Hawaii, and one more island whose name I have forgotten. Besides these, there are very small islands as well. The large island appears to be about the size of the entire kingdom of Ryukyu, while the remaining six islands each appear to have a circumference of about thirty to forty ri.

Regarding vegetation: There is a tree called hau that resembles paulownia. Pine, cypress, oak, cedar, plum, and cherry trees are not seen. There are large sandalwood trees and dense forests are observed. Additionally, there are various trees and flowering plants with differently shaped leaves. Flowers bloom throughout all four seasons, but these are not plants seen in Japan.

Regarding birds and beasts: Chickens and birds called "toiki" that resemble white birds are kept domestically

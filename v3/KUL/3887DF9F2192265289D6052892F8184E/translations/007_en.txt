When we indicated through gestures that we had been shipwrecked and stranded on the island, they seemed to understand this as well, and they gave us animal meat and cared for us. I thought that the ship's approach to our island was due to our hearts being completely connected, but I learned that they had actually come close to the island because the weather was good and they wanted to land and perhaps catch some fish. When we indicated through gestures that we had left clothing and other items on the island, they seemed to understand, and the next morning on the 5th, one small boat was launched with one dark-skinned foreigner aboard, who went to retrieve the items we had left on the island. On the same day, around five o'clock (8 AM), they set sail. We were kept in the lower part of the ship and could not tell the direction clearly, but we were told they sailed toward the southeast.

From then on, we helped with the sailors' work and engaged in whaling at various places, catching about five whales. Around October of the same year, as I recall, we arrived at a place called Oahu in the Sandwich Islands. The ship was from New Bedford in North America, with Captain William H. Whitfield, and the vessel was named John and James Howland, a whaling ship. There were Americans, Hawaiians, and two Africans aboard—thirty-four crew members in total.

At first, we communicated through hand gestures and such, but during the several months aboard the ship, we gradually learned the language quite well and could communicate our needs through a combination of words and gestures. The captain told us that he would report to the local authorities and arrange lodging before allowing us to disembark, so we should remain on the ship for a while. We stayed as instructed. This place was a south-facing harbor, with the harbor extending about half a ri inland.

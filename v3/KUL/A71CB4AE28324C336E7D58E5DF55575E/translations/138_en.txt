(British officials directly govern San'otsu Island, and in the capital they necessarily value a bag of gold), six out of ten residents ultimately cannot escape the name of "green forest" bandits (traditionally, the West already had pirates, and the June climate is fearsome).

　　　Six　Eastern察加 (Kamchatka)
Wearing beast skins in the strange cold that makes fingers fall off (when extremely cold, ears, nose, and limbs also fall off), wind and snow on bearded faces threading pearl-like strings (the natives keep mustaches and make sounds when speaking). How could one forget the hospital's careful attention? (Entering the hospital with the same fire to receive treatment, watching, tea, and food - all are thoroughly provided). Yet one laughs at the slow walking of criminal prisoners (serious criminals have both feet bound with iron shackles weighing five kan). When sheep shoulder blades are cooked, dawn has already come (in summer months, nights are short and the sun doesn't set below the horizon; the sheep shoulder blade matter is mentioned in Tang histories). Where dog paws race, ice becomes level (using dogs to pull carts on ice). Even in this extremely cold, barren land it is still like this - it's regrettable that fertile land goes untended (people say that due to some disease, there are strict prohibitions in the territory and sowing is not permitted).

　　　Seven　Hottokgatsu Town (Unalaska Island)  
Furnace-warmed gentle heat spreads through the room (the furnace shape resembles a curved chimney storing fire, with iron tubes for ventilation), rather like before August's golden wind (hanging thermometers to measure temperature, always like mid-autumn). One sumo match lasting until noon (the guest had physical strength and repeatedly defeated the natives to cheers), imperial favor doubled daily for guests (once ate at the same table as the chieftain). Repeatedly amazed by the art of bringing the dead back to life (medical techniques are skillfully divine - there are those who saw off hands and gouge out eyes yet heal). Once read chapters on "spanning heaven and mapping earth" (the guest learned quite a bit about the five studies' Pythagorean methods of expansion and contraction in this town). How could former enemies now exchange pleasantries so endurably? (The chieftain is suspected to be of Mongol descent; the guest didn't know initially but later heard and wept with emotion).

　　　Eight　Armored Ship
What harm are surging angry waves? Lock the windows with planking and let it toss freely (ocean vessels immediately close windows and doors tightly when there are wind and waves - not a drop of water can enter). Parting the dawn mist before the mountains (once encountered morning fog and got lost, several cannon shots indeed scattered it - bronze cannons are mentioned in military records). Slanted sunlight reflects in glass-bottomed water (the ship's bottom is dark but gains brightness through this). The Kunlun (black people) are at peace, all singing and dancing (the black demons are confined to the ship with nothing to operate, only drinking and dancing, so when clear weather continues they necessarily wish for hurricanes). Trumpets sound to regulate the uniform drill (in training they perform alone, firing mirrors but not teaching stabbing attacks).
Alas! Our country's boat and oar techniques are lost in confusion - even at arm's length we suffer in the vast ocean.

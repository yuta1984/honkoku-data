〇"Hedo" is the port of "Owahe" Island. The size of the island is, I believe, about forty to fifty ri. The visiting guests stayed only four days and obtained these details. However, the desolate appearance can be surmised. The port faces northeast, with steep overlapping mountains at its back. In the hollow depressions, small trees grow sparsely. One peak spouts fire. Ocean vessels sight this volcano from afar and use it as a landmark for the port. Its highest peak surpasses what guests observed in the "San'ichi" islands. If one were to climb it, it would be about one ri or more. The width of the port entrance is more than twenty chō, with giant rocks clustering on both sides, protruding five to six shaku above the water surface. The interior of the port consists of flat sandy ground, and where sand and soil have accumulated, the shore height is three to four shaku, winding like a belt across the port. Sappanwood and sugarcane flourish everywhere, forming forests. The houses of the upper class are located behind the forests. On the sand are the islanders' settlements, spacious trading houses, and other buildings. Coconut trees grow in clusters. At the water's edge, "keno" boats are moored in rows on the sand. This is to prevent them from being washed away. The left side of the port is also a small bay where "keno" boats can be anchored.

※Note: Western books say that even from "Una" it can be seen, and the guest records in abbreviated form that there are large mountains on both sides.

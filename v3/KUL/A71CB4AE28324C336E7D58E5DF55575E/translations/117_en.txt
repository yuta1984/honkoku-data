○ "Wairoko" Port is located behind the mountains of "Lahaina" and faces north.
The mountain formation covers the port, and climbing up would be about half a ri. Because it faces north,
the forest is dense and lush with many valleys, clear streams flow rapidly, and the climate is cool and cold.
During their January, thin ice forms on the surface of basins and bowls. This is
an extraordinary phenomenon completely absent in the "Sandwich" Islands. The port is blocked to the south by mountains, so
in winter it is cool with the facing wind, but in summer the air circulation is poor and it actually
feels hotter than "Lahaina." The port entrance has a width of over two ri
and can accommodate large three-masted ships. Both sides have many steep rocks. On the sandy shore
there are many coconut palms. The Cantonese merchant "John's" shop is located in the center. The American
missionary temple is located at the western corner by the seashore. There is also a small bay to the east of the port
called "Waihoho." It extends about three to four chō inland and should be suitable for mooring small boats.
There is also a settlement of natives. The water and land routes
by which visitors travel to and from the southern port are indicated with arrows showing the beginning and end points.

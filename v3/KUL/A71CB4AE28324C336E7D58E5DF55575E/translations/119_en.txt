○What is called "Wahoi" or "Owaho" is the island name, and serves as the prefecture name. At north latitude 21+ degrees. The harbor entrance faces east, with flat mountains behind it. If one climbs up, it would be about half a ri. Short sandalwood trees (katagi) grow abundantly there.
The tips of both gorges are covered with piled rocks. The left rock extends over 200 ken in length, while the right rock is lower at over 150 ken. The two rocks are separated by over 2 chō. The width of the harbor's interior is over 3 chō. The water is shallow, so heavy vessels like warships ("man-of-war") anchor about half a ri offshore and do not enter the harbor. Whaling ships of over 30 ken in length can dock there. During their August-September season, whaling ships crowd together with masts standing like a forest, reaching approximately 70-80 vessels.
The prefectural castle faces east, spanning several tens of ken in width and over 100 ken north to south. The castle gate opens facing west.

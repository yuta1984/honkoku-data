When [they were] cutting wood, Japanese hid in the grass and fired guns, killing one sailor. Everyone was startled, abandoned their axes, and fled back to the ship. They quickly distanced themselves from land and went to a distant place where even the top of the mast could not be seen. Everyone discussed taking revenge for that day's battle, and in the middle of the night suddenly turned the ship around, moored it to the shore, and secretly transported cannons to the mountaintop.

Are you not the children of Japan's 'King'?" So saying, they brought a boy and acted out this scenario to demonstrate.

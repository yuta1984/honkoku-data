"Lahainalena" is the main port of "Maui" Island and faces south. Its mountain rises toward the north, appearing distant when viewed from the port. To climb it requires gradual ascent. Scorched by the sun, there is little vegetation, though one type of tree grows there. Its roots are used for medicine, but the name is not known in detail. The width of the harbor entrance is about one ri, with few rocks. There is also an earthen cliff about three feet high that divides the sand. Above the shore there are many coconut groves. The houses are sparse and not densely packed. The mansion of "Alei" (the island chief) has more than ten cannons lined up. The temple of "Misuraharaoina n" is located nearby. The school is located in the foothills about half a ri from the temple. The Guangdong trading post is located on the sand. Generally, the dwellings of the islanders are thatched and low and crude. The buildings of America, Guangdong, and others have earthen walls and are spacious. Therefore, when viewed at a glance, beautiful and ugly structures are intermixed.

　There was a man named Aoyagi
　Bunpachi who lived in Karadomari Bay, Shima District, Chikuzen Province. In the autumn of Hōreki 12 (1762), the year of the Metal Horse,
　he built a new ship with a capacity of 1,600 koku and named it Ise-maru. The ship's
　captain was Bunpachi's eldest son, Jūemon. The helmsman was Shinshichi, with the elder Jinbei,
　cook Genzō, and sixteen other sailors, making a total crew of twenty.

Tō: The Katsuhara Shiwa states that regarding the character 嶴, someone said that in the preface to Shōgyo Yoteki, there is the phrase "Tōchū Ichiji" (One temple in Tō), written in Dokurin's own hand as 嶴. In the postscript of the ancient Kōkyō (Classic of Filial Piety) that arrived by ship recently, in Hō Ibun's postscript, there is "Nagasaki Tō." Tō refers to a place where seawater pools, like a rocky shore, according to Nagata Tōkō's account. This character also appears in Gozasō, and seems to refer to places where sea vessels dock. Nagasaki Tō is the same. When checking dictionaries, this character is not found. Someone said that in Hen'in Kanju-shū it states "㠗 crow's cry cut, same as 隩, Setsumbun says 'water bend shore,' also colloquially the same as 墺."

Vegetables include daikon radish, carrots, etc. in abundance, and other vegetables and items found in Japan seem to be generally available. Garlic is commonly used. Fish are also generally the same as in Japan, with large sea bream and flounder frequently seen. There are also tofu and konjac shops.

1. Fruits are generally the same as in Japan, and in addition there are plenty of olives and longan fruit, which can be bought fresh. About thirty pieces sell for ten mon in coins.

1. Tōmon is a foreign ship landing, so there are foreigners living there with their wives and children. I observed Annam people, English people, Indian people, and Cross people.

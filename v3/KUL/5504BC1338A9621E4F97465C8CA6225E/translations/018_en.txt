Regarding the matter of the country's character, in circumstances like this time, since it is designated as "monokari" (temporary borrowing), it is unnecessary, but I understood from Shiroji that the arrangement for temporary borrowing should be made.

1. Around the time of departure from Nagasaki, there was much rainy weather, so since the Saga route has many river crossings and the degree of river obstruction was difficult to predict, Shiroji advised that it would be better to go via the Karatsu route. Therefore, on the return journey, we went via the Karatsu route. However, when crossing to Akamagaseki, there was a great storm, and we stayed one day at Uchinori station, arriving home on the 2nd day of the 5th month of the year of Tora after 25 days of travel. Regarding the detailed observations of the customs and terrain of Nagasaki, China, and the western provinces along the route, the details will be recorded in the previous register and reported later, but first I will report on the circumstances during the stay in Nagasaki.

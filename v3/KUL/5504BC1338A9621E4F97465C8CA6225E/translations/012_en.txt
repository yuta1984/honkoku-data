These types [of animals] along with goats are enclosed within fencing, with only cattle and sheep placed inside, while the others are kept together in one place, but they do not bite each other. Cattle give birth to only one calf at a time. Pigs have five or six piglets, "Borego" (sheep) have two, and "Kabron" (goats) have one offspring each.

On the day before the wedding, they carried about six small chest-like objects and arranged them at the entrance, leaving the front door wide open for people to view. The next day at seven o'clock in the evening, both the groom and bride went to the temple, and all the villagers also went to the temple, each lighting candles around their necks. Then the groom and bride were seated on curved stools (chairs) before the Buddha, and cord-like objects resembling five-colored braided strings were made into rings and placed around the necks of the bride and groom. A large furoshiki-like cloth with brocade-like material featuring decorative stitching patterns was draped over both of them, and the monk chanted something and [illegible] draped it over them.

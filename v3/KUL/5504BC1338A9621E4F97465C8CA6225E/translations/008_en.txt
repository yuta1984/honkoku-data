　　Section on America, San José
1. During my stay in this place, I was cared for by a farming household, so I observed how that family cultivated their fields. Around approximately one and a half chō of farmland, they had made living hedges. The crops they planted were: corn, pumpkins, watermelons, tobacco, peppers, sweet potatoes, winter onions, and sugar cane. They also tried growing daikon radishes, but since they grew very poorly, they hardly cultivate them anymore. The farmland is sandy soil, plowed with oxen, and crops are planted year-round without distinction between summer and winter. There are no wells within the farmland, so when they need to water the crops, they set up troughs from upstream and add water morning and evening.

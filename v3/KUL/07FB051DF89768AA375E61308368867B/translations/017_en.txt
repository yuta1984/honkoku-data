Due to wind and rain, conditions were poor. While waiting and observing at Futago offshore for a while, the weather improved slightly, so we began rowing. However, south winds picked up, and both the Chinese ship and escort vessels raised their sails. From Isowaki offshore,
the wind blew even stronger. The rowing boats withdrew at this point, and from then the wind blew vigorously. Around 8 o'clock we arrived at Yura in Awaji Province.

15th day: Good weather, but south wind and clouds early in the morning, so the ship remained at the same location.
From Yura to Hyogo in Settsu Province is 10 ri. Additionally, 55 borrowed rowing boats from Lord Matsudaira Awa-no-kami
departed.

16th day: Good weather. Departed Yura after 6 o'clock, arrived at Hyogo in Settsu Province around 8 o'clock.
　　At this location, 15 rowing boats departed: 10 from Koma-ga-mura village, and
　　11 from Suma Bay.

From Hyogo to Akashi in Harima Province is 5 ri.

17th day: Good weather. Departed Hyogo around 6 o'clock. Around 5 o'clock, south winds picked up and the escort ships
gathered at Shiya, waiting and observing for a while. The wind blew strongly, and the Chinese ship could not
gather at Iwaya, so they moored at a place called Rinzen in Akashi Port, Harima Province. The escort ships also
entered Akashi Port around 9:30.
　　Additionally, 33 rowing boats and service vessels from Lord Matsudaira Sakon-shōgen, plus 1 guard ship.

18th day: Good weather. Departed Akashi after 6 o'clock, but the Chinese ship ran aground on the rocks. Various
escort ships tried to pull it off with both vessels, but it would not come free. After trying various methods for a while,
they raised anchor at 4:30, and from there rowed forward, arriving at Muro in Harima Province around 7 o'clock.
　　Additionally, Lord Sakai Ugaku-no-kami provided 2 guard ships and 42 rowing boats and service vessels.

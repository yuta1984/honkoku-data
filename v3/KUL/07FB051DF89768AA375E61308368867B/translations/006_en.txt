Once the order comes down, we will immediately have several small boats tow your ship and send it to the Nagasaki region - this is the customary law of our martial nation. Our sovereign lord is benevolent and compassionate, and views you the same as our own people. Moreover, you are good people in the midst of hardship. Therefore, he has ordered the officials to move your ship to this harbor. This is a good place to shelter from wind and avoid waves, and furthermore, guard boats are on both sides to protect you from other bandits and pirates. You can be as secure as Mount Tai - there is nothing to worry about. Stay anchored here for a while. In not too distant days, you will be able to return to your home country. The lingering cold is apt to attack, so take good care of yourselves.　　Narusawa

　　Presenting a poem to Wang Shouzhen:
Meeting by chance, we try to converse, but the foreign sounds are unclear to understand. Though people are separated by Hu and Yue, how could hearts distinguish between harmony and purity? I want to take up my brush to serve as my tongue, but clumsy words are hard to express. My feelings reach thousands of miles to Jiangnan, I pity you and ask about your journey home.

I am unlearned and cannot compose poetry in return. Thank you very much.　　Wang
　Twelfth day
Although we suffered the hardships of being cast adrift, we were able to observe the scenery of Japan, turning misfortune into fortune. When we return home in the future, we will have a good story to tell.

On the day I return home, I will speak of the good deeds showing the warm human kindness of your honorable country.　　Wang

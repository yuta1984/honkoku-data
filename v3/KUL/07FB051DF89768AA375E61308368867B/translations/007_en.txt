I have an official command and must return to the capital today, so I compose this quatrain to bid farewell:
In this sage reign, saving the people knows no boundaries. The benevolent wind brings no harm, and you can return to your homeland. Yesterday we met, today we part. All of this is but a spring night's dream.

You have shown me kindness, and though we must suddenly part, you have composed a poem, but I, being untalented in my old age, cannot compose one in response. I humbly thank you. Tomorrow I will send it up the mountain.

Have you personally seen the Great Wall? If not, you must have heard of it. Is it built of stone? Are there watchtowers on the wall? Are there guard officers and soldiers?　　　Narusawa

I have not yet reached the Great Wall. It is located three hundred li north of Beijing. Its name is Shanhaiguan, and it has towers and gates. There are three major gates and countless small gates.　　　Wang

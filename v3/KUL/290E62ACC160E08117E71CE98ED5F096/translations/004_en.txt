The above is a higaki-kaisen cargo ship transporting goods from Osaka to Edo.

Departed from Osaka Kawaguchi on the 16th day of the 10th month of the previous Snake year with favorable winds, sailing along the coasts of Izumi and Kii provinces with tailwinds, soon crossed Enshū-nada, and from there also approached Sagami-nada, but encountered headwinds and put into Izu Nagahama and Ajiro ports. After various delays, by the 29th day entered Uraga port, arrived at Edo Shinagawa on the 1st day of the 11th month, remained in port until the 17th of the same month for 18 days, departed from the same place on the 18th, received official inspection at Uraga on the 19th, departed from the same place on the following 20th, following favorable winds crossed Sagami-nada, and by around the Hour of the Sheep on the following 21st also crossed Enshū-nada, but at Ōzaki in Shima Province encountered south winds as headwinds. While dealing with this, as evening approached, winds came from the west-northwest direction. From this point we tried to navigate keeping to the leeward of the coast, but could not approach at all, and having no other choice, turned back and lowered most of the sails.

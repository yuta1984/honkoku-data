entering Uraga port by the 29th, arrived at Edo Shinagawa on the 1st day of the 11th month, and
remained anchored until the 17th of the same month. Departed from the same place on the 18th, received official inspection at Uraga on the 19th, and on the following
20th departed from the same place. Following favorable winds, crossed Sagami-nada, and on the following
21st, by around the hour of the Sheep, also crossed Enshū-nada, but at Ōzaki in Shima Province
the south wind became a headwind, and while dealing with this, at dusk fog also appeared,
wind came from the northwest direction, from this point took care to stay away from the dangerous coastal areas, adjusting the sails, but even so
could not make headway, with no other choice, turned back toward the offing and lowered most of the sails.

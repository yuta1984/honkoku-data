there were items: one hanging curtain (katabari) per tatami mat each, these mosquito nets have openings on the sides. One cotton-padded garment each, one futon each, and one hood each. When we asked where these were given from, they only said "from the master," and we could not learn the details. Overall, considering the expenses for us at Taihō, it appears that about two hundred ryō in gold was spent. The interpreter said, "If you are to cross to Japan in four days, it would be difficult to secure passage on one ship, so please separate and board two vessels."

We boarded the ships to wait. Now, thirty people boarded the ship called Tokuhō, all Chinese merchants coming to Nagasaki. The ship that Sentarō boarded after departing Taihō was called Kintaihei and carried one hundred people. Thus, on the 28th day of the 12th month of the year of the Ox, we raised sails at the port of Taihō, and from there the two ships together took the helm, and the sailors saw us off. Now, regarding how they saw us off and delivered us safely, firstly it was due to the merciful願 of the gods and Buddha, and secondly due to the mighty virtue of Tōshō Shinkun (Tokugawa Ieyasu).

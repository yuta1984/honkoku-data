A Sanshikan (senior councilor) named Yana curried favor with the Ming Dynasty and neglected tribute to Japan. Therefore, the Lord of Satsuma requested permission to launch a punitive expedition and sent several thousand troops and horses. Finally, they captured King Sho Nei as a prisoner, took him to Satsuma, and held him as a hostage for three years. He repented of his previous errors and swore to be a vassal people for eternity thereafter. Because of this, he was pardoned and allowed to return. This occurred in the 17th year of Keicho under Emperor Go-Mizunoo, which was the 40th year of Wanli of the Great Ming.

"Kimitesuri" - A deity that appears once every seven years
"Yomikameri" - A deity that appears once every twelve years

When these two deities appear, all people fear and revere them, worshipping them in their homes. About one hundred officials carrying five-colored umbrellas come out from Tamagusuku to welcome the deities into the castle, offering various fine wines and rare delicacies, presenting flower arrangements and lanterns, with the king himself performing worship and praying for the people's peace. For seven days, umbrellas are held over them. These umbrellas are beautifully decorated in various colors, with lengths of four to five jo (about 12-15 meters), spanning roughly twenty hiro (about 36 meters). Even the shorter ones are about two jo long, with approximately one hundred umbrellas erected in the spacious courtyards. People go to the gates to worship from afar.

○ Satonoshi is what we call koshou (page boys). They select handsome young men. When they age and grow beards, they become Pechin. According to the national custom, they do not use razors, and let their beards grow naturally. Also, since they are generally dark-skinned, they appear older than their years. Pechin is an official title, but according to the customs of that country, all warriors are called "O-pechin" and such.

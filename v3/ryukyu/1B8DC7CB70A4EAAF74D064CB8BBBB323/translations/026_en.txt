〇A god worshipped in the Ryukyu Kingdom
"Ouchikiou" Suihaku (Water Earl) {{Marginal note: Also called "fuunakiou" | The god of water}}

The form of this god: about ten feet tall, with white hair disheveled. His eyes are large and bright, like lightning. He wears yellow robes on his body and shoes on his feet. His testicles are extremely large. He wraps them with a loincloth, ties it, and hangs it around his neck. He constantly emerges on the water surface to play. Those who see him obtain good fortune. Divine images of him are either carved or painted in temples throughout the country and revered.

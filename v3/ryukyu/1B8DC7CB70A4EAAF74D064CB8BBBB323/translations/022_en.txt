The next rank is called "bikurabou," the next "barusame," and the lowest class is called "bukuberu" (these are like what we call "yotaka" [streetwalkers] here).

○ Alcohol is called "kinbo" (this is colloquial language). What comes from Dahinzan, a dependency of the Ryukyu Kingdom, is called "dahinshuu" (Taihei sake). There is red wine (its color is red like vermillion and clear, used for offerings to gods). What comes from Yaeyama is called "mirinshuu" (forest sake). What comes from Kanmura is called "awakibo" (millet sake). What is called "sugar awamori" in Satsuma province is this. All of the above are distilled spirits, and there is no sake like ours at all.

○ Gold and silver are scarce. For currency, they primarily use small silver coins that come from here [Japan]. The coins are Kan'ei Tsūhō. What are called "bean coins" are cast in that country, having no characters or designs. They have no rim either. There are also some shaped like flowers.

○ There is a vessel from that country called "gintokuri." It is something for holding coins. Its shape is as shown in the diagram.

Illustration of Palanquins
　The king uses a shoulder-carried palanquin (agekoshi). Those of lower rank
　all use sedan chairs (kago). Those used by nobles
　are decorated with carved metalwork, the exterior is
　wrapped in brocade, and the interior has paintings pasted
　on it, and so forth.

Illustration of Decorated Horses
　The horses are no different from those in Japan. They do not stumble when traveling
　over mountain slopes or rocky fields, and when climbing mountains or crossing water
　they gallop. This is because they have naturally become accustomed to that terrain.
　This land is warm in all four seasons, and even in winter
　the grass does not wither, so throughout the year
　they can eat green grass, therefore there is no need
　to feed them beans. When common households need
　horses, they bring them in from the fields,
　and when their business is finished, they release them back to the fields.
　The saddles, stirrups and other equipment are no different
　from Japanese horse gear. However, they attach
　round tassels made of red thread
　to the bottom of the small cords and to the breast strap.

The floor height is three to four shaku, and the ridge is not very high, in order to avoid sea winds. The roof uses tiles. Tatami mats, doors, and shoji screens are the same as in Japan. For pillars, they use rakan-sugi (arhat cedar) that grows on Oshima and Kikaigashima islands. 《Marginal note: Rakan-matsu is maki (podocarpus) | Perhaps rakan-sugi is also a type of maki》 The price is extremely high. The wood grain is extremely beautiful, does not get worm-eaten for thousands of years, and as years pass, its luster becomes mirror-like. Walls are made with board paneling and covered with karakami paper. Bamboo blinds are extremely coarse, woven from thin round bamboo and hung from the eaves. For garden design, they plant boxwood and cypress pine on artificial hills, trimmed either round or square, dig small ponds to keep fish, place small stones in the water, and plant cycads and other small flowering trees on top for enjoyment. Generally, outer enclosures are made by piling up oyster stones. 《Marginal note: Oyster stones are whetstone-like | Perhaps a type of grinding stone》 In large houses, they especially polish and fit them together, so they appear as if cut from a single stone slab, which is very magnificent. Temple grounds mostly have boxwood hedges that are trimmed. This also grows only in this country.

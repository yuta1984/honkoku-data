They hold the child's waist with one hand, supporting them on their hip bone while walking. 《Marginal note: This can be seen in illustrations of women》According to the Biography of Monk Jōsai, since "Ryukyu is the island of Benzaiten," men respect women more than themselves.

○Fondness for Sneezing
Ryukyu people, believing it to be medicine for longevity, are fond of sneezing. Even while receiving guests, they insert paper strips into their nostrils to induce sneezing, as told by people from Satsuma.

○Song and Dance
When song and dance performances are held at the royal palace, a stage of five or six jō square is constructed, curtains are hung on all four sides, and musicians wear red and green robes, each wearing their respective headgear. They hold three-stringed instruments covered with snake skin, fiddles, flutes, small gongs, drums, and other instruments, arranging themselves in two rows and slowly singing musical scores. After a while, the curtain at the stage approach is raised and the dancers emerge.

○Four young boys wear vermillion tabi, don long robes of five colors as outer garments, and wear caps made of black leather with attached red cords on their heads. They ascend the stage while spinning, and sit facing the musicians. When the musicians take their caps and wind the red cords around the tops of the caps before returning them, the boys receive them, stand up, and dance with foot rhythms matching the musical phrases. This is called the "Hat Dance."

(When reading with Japanese pronunciation, calling them "funhako" (document box) and "kintachi" (young nobles) is an example of Japanese reading. As stated here, in Ryukyu, ancient Japanese language remains unchanged.) These deities have both yin and yang aspects.

Those that descend from heaven are called Kiraikanai no Kinmamon, and those that rise from the sea are called Ohotsukakuwoku no Kinmamon. They appear every month and possess takujo (women who serve the gods). (Nakara considers that takujo are like shrine maidens who serve the gods.) They play in various sacred groves called ogamibayashi. (Nakara considers: what exactly are these sacred groves?

These thirty-three takujo are all women of royal blood. The queen is also one of them. The number of takujo throughout the country is unknown. When these gods become angry, the people break their arms and fingernails to worship and appease them. (Nakara considers that this transmits the ancient tradition of purification rituals from Japan's age of gods.) In their customs, they revere and worship all the large stones and great trees of every peak and inlet as deities. There are also rough gods (arakami) that appear once every seven years and once every twelve years, manifesting simultaneously across distant islands. The appearance of rough gods is called Kimitesuري. Before their appearance, during the eighth and ninth months of that year, something called Awori appears. That mountain is called Awori-dake. It is brilliantly colored in five hues with various ornamentations, appearing as three objects on three peaks. Their size covers an entire mountain. When the tenth month arrives, the gods certainly appear. The takujo and royal retainers each beat drums and sing songs to welcome the gods. The palace courtyard serves as the place where gods arrive, and over thirty umbrellas are erected. These umbrellas are enormous, with heights of seven to eight jō, and their circumference...

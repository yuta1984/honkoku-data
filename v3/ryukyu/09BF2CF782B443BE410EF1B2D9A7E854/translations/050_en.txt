seems to be the case. The "Chūzan Seifu" states: "In the first year of Qiandao of the Southern Song dynasty, year of the Metal Rooster (1165), Lord Chinzei Tametomo, following his exile, arrived in the country, fathered one son and returned. That son was named Sonton. He later became Urasoe Aji. (omitted section) The people of the country elevated Sonton as their lord. This was King Shunten." It also states: "King Shunten's surname was Minamoto, his title was Sonton. His father was Lord Chinzei Hachirō Tametomo, his mother was the younger sister of Ōsato Aji." From this text, it is clear that King Shunten's father was Tametomo.

○Letters from Ryukyuan People
Recently, by chance, I obtained two letters exchanged between Ryukyuan princes and retainers of Satsuma domain. Rather than simply treasuring them as curiosities for my own amusement, which would not serve my true purpose, I have copied them exactly as written to present them for the examination of interested scholars. The outer wrapping was sealed with paper similar to nishinouchi, and the letters were written on Chinese paper cut to hōsho size. The "twenty bundles of white hemp paper" mentioned in Prince Yoshimura's letter refers to paper manufactured in Satsuma domain. Both Prince Yoshimura and Prince Ōgimi are brothers of Prince Ginowan, who came to Edo as an envoy this year. I have omitted the addressees' names out of discretion. Some people suspect these might be ghost-written because the calligraphy appears too Japanese in style, but as I mentioned at the beginning, the Ōhashi school of calligraphy is predominantly practiced in that country.

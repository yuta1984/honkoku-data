《marginal note: His son Yoshimoto yielded the throne to the descendants of Tenson-shi｜The popular belief that the current Ryukyu king is of Tametomo's bloodline is erroneous｜》According to Churyo's opinion, the "Chuzan Denshin Records" states that
Shunten was a descendant of the Japanese Emperor, the son of Osato Aji (Osato-no-ansu), Asako.
Osato is a place name, and Aji is an official title. 《marginal note: Osato Aji was Tametomo's father-in-law｜Or perhaps he yielded his position to his son-in-law｜》
《marginal note: Aji held the rank of Junior First Rank,｜equivalent to territorial lords and feudal princes》Asako was probably a shortened form of Tametomo's name, omitting the character "Tame."
According to Master Hakuseki's "Ryukyu Jiryaku," during the Eiman era of Emperor Nijo's reign, Tametomo floated on the sea, followed the currents seeking land, and arrived at Ryukyu.
《marginal note: It is said that the name was changed to Ryukyu based on the meaning of "seeking by following currents"｜This theory is incorrect as this name existed before》The people of the country feared and submitted to his martial prowess.
He named the country Ryukyu, and eventually united with the sister of Osato Aji and bore King Shunten. Tametomo remained in this country for a long time, but unable to suppress his longing for his homeland, he eventually returned to Japan. 《marginal note: as stated｜》The record in "Wakan Sansai Zue" that after Tametomo's death, a shrine was erected and given the divine name Shunten Taijingu is erroneous. I note this in passing. When Tametomo was eighteen years old, like his father Rokujō Hangan Tameyoshi, he became a supporter of the Retired Emperor Shin'in, but when the military campaign failed, he was exiled to Izu Province. At twenty-nine, he crossed to Demon Island, and after returning home, due to complaints from the people, government forces were sent against him, and he committed suicide at thirty-three years old, as recorded in the "Hogen Heiji Monogatari." Master Hakuseki's claim that what is called Demon Island in our country is indeed present-day Ryukyu - I cannot find any basis for this view. In my humble opinion, the ancient name of this land was Okino Island (屋其惹島). Alternatively, by changing the characters to read "Akki-no Island" (悪鬼納島), through forced association...

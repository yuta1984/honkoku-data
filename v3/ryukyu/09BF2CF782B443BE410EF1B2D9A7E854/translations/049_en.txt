On a snowy morning at a place called Fujieda

During the night, the moon shone clear on my grass pillow, and white snow accumulates on the fields where I rise at dawn

　　Mount Matsuo

The evergreen color cannot be seen at Mount Matsuo when snow falls on both peak and foothills

　　Fukakusa Village

With the falling snow, even the quail's nest is buried—winter is truly moving in Fukakusa village

　　With a celebratory heart

Since waves and winds are calmed in my lord's reign, the villages of Japan are not far from the path [of peace]

　　In reply to the departing one

Through these words that expressed sorrow over the snow on sleeves, the depth of your heart may also be known

○Concerning Chinzei Hachirō
Just as this book completed the work of printing, from a noble lord I was graciously allowed to borrow the "Chūzan Seifu" (Genealogy of the Chūzan Dynasty) compiled by Sai On, Purple-Gold Master and retainer of the Ryukyu Kingdom.

That Tōkō is Tametomo has been stated above. However, since this text does not clearly record him as Tametomo, it is not entirely settled

The flowers and trees are quite serene and secluded. Now it has already fallen into ruin. There remains only one room. During the Xuande period, Imperial Envoy Chaishan visited Ryukyu three times. He once built the Thousand Buddha Pavilion of Daianzen Temple. In the records of Ming's Xia Ziyang, two accounts of this are recorded. Now no one knows where these places were. *Note: The former name of Gokoku Temple was Anzen Temple. Perhaps this was the very place he built. When asking the local people, none know about it.*

[Tenku Mountain] Located northwest of Tomari village along the coast. It faces Naminoue's Yukizaki across the water. Below there is [Shogen Temple]. Stone walls surround it on four sides, with one building complex within an area of over ten mu. Outside the walls are over ten old pine trees. There is Tenku Cave. In front of the cave is one Kannon pavilion. It is locked and has no monks. Following the coast eastward, large stones stand separately. Some are square, some round, leaning against layered cliffs above. Below they form cliff caves, quite extraordinary. Going further about one ri, there is water flowing west into the sea. This is called Tomari Harbor.

This is a place for offering prayers and gratitude for safe sea crossings. In front, several hundred ancient pines stand majestically. The front area is slightly hollow. The four mountains are all covered with pines. Thirty-odd paces to the east, there is a spring called Oisen. It flows from stones and pours into a pool. It trickles continuously without cease. Above the spring are three old pine trees. Their drooping and upright forms are most extraordinary. Looking east, there is Tsuboya Mountain. There are several tiled building complexes, serving as

《Inscription text continued: their taxes and levies. When encountering the destitute and poor, he immediately provided from his own resources to support them. The people all rejoiced and revered him. The king was magnanimous and benevolent, not fond of killing, and never bent the law to lightly pardon anyone. He was still able to carefully establish Engaku Zen Temple. Its scale is grand and spacious, with ceremonial objects complete. It serves as a place for celebrating longevity. Whenever the king took leisure, he always shared it with the people. This is truly a magnificent sight of the country. Here we wish to carve this in stone at the temple, thereby manifesting the king's virtue. We bestow these words upon it. A certain person said: If it is as you describe, then the king's worthiness can truly be said to stand uniquely above a hundred generations from ancient times. Thus I compose this song to illuminate and show it to future generations.

The verse says: In Qiuyang there is a country, connected to the surrounding seas. Not holding court with China for more than a thousand years. But our imperial ancestor was benevolent and kind to all directions. Taking the lead in admiring righteousness, they came to offer tribute and acknowledge kingship. Sacred teachings gradually spread over ten-odd generations. With pure customs and renewed spirit, storing up fortune and developing blessings, there arose prominently a worthy king, aptly titled Shoshin. Separating from the crowd and standing apart from others, abandoning the old and planning the new. Simplifying punishments and reducing penalties. Caring for orphans and aiding the distressed. Touring in spring and autumn, treating subjects kindly and ensuring peaceful dwellings. Harmony above and joy below for over twenty years. Honoring virtue and deepening benevolence, like flowing rivers and standing hills. There is a beautiful great man, whose modest words are very clear. I compose this poem to replace songs and ballads. Great Ming Hongzhi 11th year, year cycle wuwu, eighth month, twelfth day. Subjects Cheng Lian, Zheng Jiu, Liang Neng, Chen Yi respectfully kowtow and establish this.》

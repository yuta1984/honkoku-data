[Yaeyama] is also named Kitaki Mountain. The local name is Ishikaki. It is also named Yama. It is located 40 li southwest of Taiheizan, 2,400 li from Chuzan. From Pengjishan in Fujian Taiwan, using the southeast-by-east compass bearing, one reaches Yaeyama. During the Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty, when King Satto of Chuzan first established relations with the Chinese court, two large islands came to pay tribute to Chuzan—namely Yaeyama and Taiheizan. This mountain is even more prosperous compared to Taiheizan. It has abundant oak wood, black wood, yellow wood, red wood, and grass mats. It produces cattle, horses, and spiral stones. It exports hemp cloth, cotton cloth, sea cucumber, and red wine, named Mitsurin wine. It produces the five grains, amber, tortoiseshell, coral, sheep belly stones, pine-patterned stones, sea fungus, sea pine, sea cypress, and other stones. Every year in the fifth and sixth months, together with Taiheizan, it comes to pay tribute to Chuzan.

Traditional Internal Regulations for Sugar Production Control

Article 1: Regarding the control of sugar production, although internal regulations and rules have existed from the past and strict control has been maintained, in recent years this has become lax, with people pursuing immediate small profits, often engaging in shoddy mass production or impermissible fraudulent practices in buying and selling, ultimately losing the reputation of sugar, which is our prefecture's foremost product, and causing immeasurable losses to sugar industry operators. Therefore, we have now revised the traditional internal regulations as follows, and with the approval of the prefectural government, these shall be implemented from Meiji 18 (1885).

Section 1: Regarding sugar manufacturing, as there have been repeated official notifications on this matter, all parties shall deeply observe their intent and follow the instructions of district officials such as jitōdai (deputy land stewards) and sōkōsakutō (chief cultivators), as well as local regulations. Village heads and cultivators, as well as each village association, shall cooperate with each other, strive to study refining techniques, and focus on not diminishing the reputation and value of sugar. Those who violate these instructions shall pay appropriate penalty fees.

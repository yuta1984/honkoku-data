The text "Hokuwa zoku En" (Northern Wa belongs to Yan) should be read as such, but if read as "north of Kyoen's Nanwa," the terms Nanwa and Hokuwa would not make sense. This is according to Tachihara Hakuji, Director-General of the Shōkōkan. I surmise that this punctuation was indeed mistaken in the "Ishō Nihon-den." Both Kenrin and Hakuseki were careless in this matter. Looking at this book now, it is in the twelfth section (Kainai Hokukei). Following this, it states "Chōsen is located east of Retsuyo, between the northern mountains and southern sea, and Retsuyo belongs to Yan." Considering these two passages together, I believe there cannot be an error in punctuation.

The "Ryukyu-dan" cites □jiyi, recording that "in the seventh month of Hōtoku 3 (1451) during the reign of Emperor Go-Hanazono, Ryukyuan people came and presented 1,000 kan of coins and tribute goods to Shogun Yoshimasa," presenting this as if it were the beginning of relations with the imperial country. I have not yet examined the cited source. However, in the "Kanemi-ki" under the entry for the 13th day of the 8th month of Hōtoku 3, it states: "Someone said that Ryukyuan island ship merchants had not yet arrived at Hyōgo port last month, when Guardian Hosokawa Kyōchō hastily sent people to select and take their trade goods. Since payment had not yet been made, and tribute goods and payments from previous years totaling 4,000-5,000 kan remained unreturned, and with trade goods being detained, causing unbearable hardship for the islanders, the Kubō sent down three magistrates (Fuse Shimotsuke-no-kami, Iio Yozaemon, and the same Rokurō) to investigate. It was found that goods had indeed been seized. Kyōchō has not yet returned them, so the magistrates have not yet returned to the capital. Kyōchō is the former Kanrei. What unprecedented behavior!" Since it records "previous years," this year should not be the beginning. Particularly the "Nantō-shi"...

...there are detailed investigations. In particular, I searched through the "Ryukyu Shintō-ki," but found no mention of a gate inscribed with "Dragon Palace Castle," which makes this quite unreliable (this book was written during the Keichō era when the monk Taichū went to the Ryukyu Kingdom and recorded it at their request; while it does mention a gate inscription reading "Land of Propriety" (Shurei-no-kuni), it does contain the idea that the dragon palace of Buddhist teaching refers to this Ryukyu).

Looking at the "Ganjin Oshō Tōsei-den" (this biography was compiled by Shinjin Genkai in the tenth year of Hōki), we see that he was a Tang monk who first set sail in the third year of Tianbao but encountered violent winds and could not cross the sea. After similar difficulties, when he finally set sail in the twelfth year of Tianbao, he arrived at Dazaifu on the eleventh day of the first month, year Kinoe-uma of Tenpyō-shōhō 6 (though the Shoku Nihongi records it as the sixth day, Mizunoe-ne). 

Before that twelfth year voyage, during an earlier attempt on the sixteenth day of the tenth month of Tianbao 7, it records: "For three days we passed through the Snake Sea. The snakes ranged from over one jō in length to three feet, all spotted in color, covering the sea surface. For three days we passed through the Flying Fish Sea. White flying fish filled the sky, about one foot in length. For one day we traversed the Flying Bird Sea. Birds as large as humans flocked onto the ship, making it so heavy it nearly sank. When people pushed the birds away with their hands, they immediately bit their hands." The "Song Gaoseng Zhuan" records: "Suddenly drifted into the Snake Sea. The snakes were over three jō long, colored like brocade. Later entered the Fish Sea. Fish over one foot long flew filling the sky. In the next ocean, saw only flying birds gathering on the ship's deck, pressing down until it nearly sank."

Yet the "Genkō Shakusho" records this as "drifting to Jitnan and going to the dragon palace." I wonder what source this was based on? The matters of Jitnan and the dragon palace do not appear in the above two books. The "Shintō-ki" also records fear of great serpents, so this Snake Sea...

According to the genealogical records in the biography of Hidesato, it states that responding to a dragon god's request, he went to the dragon palace, defeated the dragon god's enemy, obtained treasure rice bales, and was called Tawara-○-ta by the people - this too might have been about the Ryukyu. Also, regarding the story that Tametomo crossed to Oni-ga-shima (Demon Island), which Hakuseki-sensei recorded as being about the Ryukyu, the "Ryukyu-dan" doubted this since no evidence was provided, suggesting it might derive from the name Akki-nō-shima (Okinoshima). However, if it was indeed transmitted as "a country that devours people," it could certainly be called "Demon Island" (the term "Demon Island" also appears in the "Hōgen Monogatari").

In the "Nihongi Tsūshō," volume 27 (24th year of Empress Suiko), in the section examining yaku shells, there is also some mention of the Ryukyu. Within this it states: "Upon present examination, while the Ryukyu already appears in Sui records, our Six National Histories contain no such name, which is grounds for doubt. The so-called 'Tenson' (Heavenly Grandson) title originates from us, but its genealogy has not yet been clarified. Presumably in ancient times it was confused with Yaku and shared the same name. The so-called 'Small Ryukyu' (the 'Sancai Tuhui' mentions both Large Ryukyu and Small Ryukyu, each producing famous gems and rare treasures) perhaps refers to Yaku. The sea shells mentioned in the 'Sehō-roku' can also serve as evidence." Above this, there is a theory that yaku shells are not produced on Yaku Island but in the Ryukyu, though initially people did not understand they came from the Ryukyu and named them after being transported from Yaku. This passage supports the theories in the "Nantō-shi." The rest contains nothing particularly noteworthy. The theory that Fusō-koku refers to the Ryukyu is erroneous.

The "Nantō-shi" records: "Upon present examination, Ryū-○ is the ancient Nan-wa (Southern Wa). Both Nan-wa and Hoku-wa (Northern Wa) appear in the 'Shanhai Jing.'" This is an error in punctuation. Presumably the country is located in Kyoen Nan-wa...

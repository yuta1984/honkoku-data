I hear that you had the opportunity to observe the Ryukyu people - how truly enviable! As for myself, I have been too busy to arrange the time, and in the end was unable to see them even once, which I find most regrettable. Regarding this matter, you mentioned wanting to hear what I might know about that island. While there is nothing I can add beyond what is already clearly recorded in various books, beginning with Master Hakuseki's writings and including the "Chūzan Denshin-roku" and other works, I shall write down one or two things that come to mind as you have requested.

First, regarding the characters for "Ryukyu": the Denshin-roku records it as 流虬, 流求, and 瑠求, noting that it was changed to the current characters during the Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty. However, in Japanese books, we also find it written as 留求, 流梂, and other variations (these appear in other books as well). While it is said that China changed to the current characters during the Hongwu era, the Uji Dainagon's "Konjaku Monogatari" already uses the characters 琉球 (preceding Ming Hongwu by approximately four hundred seventy to eighty years).

Now, regarding the passage in the "Jindai-ki" Kaigū Yukō chapter about Hohodemi-no-mikoto visiting the sea god's palace, the "Tsūshō" cites this alongside a passage from the biography of the priest Ganjin stating "sometimes drifting to Jitnan, sometimes going to the dragon palace," and references from the "Ryukyu Shintō-ki" about the Ryukyu king's gate being inscribed with "Dragon Palace Castle," concluding that this refers to present-day Ryukyu. At first I thought this seemed reasonable, but upon careful consideration, matters of ancient times are beyond definitive judgment. Moreover, according to one theory, the sea god's palace refers to the sea gate of Hyūga where the Kaidō shrine now stands, while Hirata Atsutane claims it refers to what the Chinese call the Three Sacred Mountains.

There was no regular intercourse with that country, so even those records that occasionally appear are all based on hearsay and speculation, and the reason there are no reliable facts is thought to be due to this. That country was also a distant island nation that was not a vassal of any country and had no diplomatic communications. However, during the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, during the time of King Satto, Ryukyu was invested as the King of Chuzan by China through the investiture system, and began traveling to China and adopting all Chinese institutions and culture. In the seventh year of Xuande under Emperor Xuanzong of Ming, the emperor commanded his eunuch official Zaizan to carry an imperial edict and dispatched him to the Ryukyu Kingdom, and the King of Chuzan sent people to communicate with our country. This seventh year of Xuande corresponds to the fourth year of Eikyō in our country. Considering this, regular intercourse had ceased early on since ancient times, and the later dispatch of envoys to our country at the behest of Emperor Xuanzong of Ming was, after many years had passed, the beginning of Ryukyu envoys coming to our country again. Even after this, in the first year of Zhengtong, Emperor Yingzong had the Ryukyu tribute envoy Wu Shijian carry a reply edict to admonish King Minamoto no Yoshinori of Japan, [marginal note: this was in the eighth year of Eikyō] and in the third year of Jiajing, the Ryukyu magistrate Jin Liang was made to relay instructions to the King of Japan [marginal note: this was in the fourth year of Daiei ○ Chuzan denshinroku, Ryukyu kokushi ryaku]. Since there are such records, letters were sent to our country from the Ming period

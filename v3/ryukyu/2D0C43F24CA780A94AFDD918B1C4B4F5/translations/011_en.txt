had come? If not, it would be difficult to reconcile with the words that people from our country answered to the Sui people at the beginning of the Daye era. Thus, although the name Ryukyu is not recorded in the historical records, we should know that there were already tributes from that country from the reign of Empress Suiko.

Upon examination, it appears that people from Yaku came in the 24th year of Empress Suiko's reign. [Marginal note: The various writings in historical records such as Yaku, Yakyaku, Yakyū, Yakyū, and Yakyū are merely different characters for the same thing.] The tributes from the southern islands probably began at this time. This Yaku is said to refer to the Ryukyu Kingdom. Also, in the 10th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign, an envoy was sent to Tanejima to have that country present maps. I believe this Tanejima also refers to Ryukyu. Because the names of the islands in the southern seas were not yet clear, and since the sea routes to Ryukyu passed through this Tanejima for travel back and forth, it was probably also called Tanejima. [Marginal note: This Tanejima refers to what is now called Tanegashima.] Later, in the 7th year of Wadō under Empress Genmei, it appears that all the islands of the southern seas submitted to imperial authority.

The above is an outline of the genealogy of the Chūzan royal line. This was recorded based on the "Chūzan Seifu" (Genealogy of Chūzan), which was compiled during the reign of King Shō Tei of Ryukyu by a man named Shō Kōtoku at the king's command.

Chinzei Hachirō Tametomo

Chinzei Hachirō Tametomo had been exiled to Ōshima in Izu. In the first year of Eiman (1165), in the third month, he saw white herons flying toward the open sea and thought, "There must surely be an island there." He boarded a boat and sailed after them until he reached an island. When he went around the island, there were no rice fields or dry fields. When he asked, "What do you eat?" they answered, "Fish and birds." The birds were about the size of brown-eared bulbuls. Tametomo, seeing this, used large turnip-head arrows to shoot down birds perched in trees and kill those flying in the sky. The island people trembled with fear. When he declared, "If you do not submit to me, I will shoot you down in the same way," they all prostrated themselves and submitted. When he asked the name of the island, they said it was called "Oni-ga-shima" (Demon Island). 《Marginal note: Hōgen Monogatari》This Demon Island to which Tametomo crossed is none other than the present-day Ryukyu Kingdom. Thus the people of the country feared his martial prowess and submitted to him.

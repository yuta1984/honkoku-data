∴Twenty-five Generations of the Tenson Dynasty─────────────────────┐
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【To King Eisho】

During the Chunxi era of the Song Dynasty, when Tokubi, a descendant of the twenty-five generations of the Tenson clan, was in power, his retainer Riyu monopolized authority and usurped the throne. Therefore, Urasoe Aji Sonton raised a righteous army and defeated Riyu. The people supported Sonton and placed him on the throne. This is called King Shunten.

○King Shunten――――Shunba Junki――――King Gihon

His surname was Minamoto, his name was Sonton, his father was Chinzei Hachiro Tametomo-ko, and his mother was the sister of Osato Aji. He was born in the second year of Qiandao, year of Hinoe-inu (1166). 《Note: The second year of Qiandao corresponds to the first year of Jin'an under Emperor Rokujo》He ascended the throne in the fourteenth year of Chunxi, year of Hinoto-hitsuji (1187), and died in the first year of Jiaxi, year of Hinoto-tori (1237). He reigned for fifty-one years and lived to seventy-two years of age. Regarding King Gihon, his childhood name and divine title are not recorded. He reigned for eleven years. When he was fifty-four years old, he advised Eisho, saying: "Now if you take charge of governance, the years will be abundant and the people will be at peace. You should properly inherit the great lineage and become the father and mother of the people." Though Eisho firmly declined, all the court ministers jointly urged him to ascend the throne. After Gihon abdicated, his place of retirement is unknown, so his lifespan and death are not recorded. Today it cannot be verified. 《Note: The bloodline of Tametomo-ko lasted three generations from King Shunten to Gihon and then ended. The three kings ruled for approximately seventy-three years in total.》

Complete Map of the Ryukyu Kingdom

The Ryukyu Kingdom has three provinces. Chūzan is Nakagami Province, Sannan is Shimajiri Province, and Sanhoku is Kunigami Province. These administrative districts total thirty-six, which are called magiri. 《marginal note: Magiri is like saying "castle town," or refers to counties and prefectures.》 The lord of each magiri is called aji. There are thirty-six tributary islands, and Kikaigashima consists of twelve islands. These are collectively called the Five Islands and Seven Islands. The products of these islands include sweet potatoes, grass mats, banana fiber, colorful fish, conch, tortoiseshell, sea cucumber, stone mushrooms, and others, totaling over thirty varieties.

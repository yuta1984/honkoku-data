He was born in Shōhei 11, hinoe-saru (1356). In Ōei 3, hinoe-ne (1396), he succeeded his father as king. He sent envoys to Ming and tributed regional products. He kept Satto's death secret and did not announce the mourning. The King of Sanhoku, Min, died, and his son Han'anchi succeeded to the throne. He also sent envoys to Ming. The King of Sannan, Shō-Satto, also frequently sent envoys to Ming and tributed local products. In the 10th year, mizunoto-hitsuji (1403), the Ming Emperor Zhu Di sent the Court Official Bian Xin and others to announce the death of his father Zhu Yuanzhang. Thereupon Bunei also sent envoys to Ming, for the first time announcing Satto's death and presenting a memorial congratulating the Ming Emperor's accession to the throne. The King of Sanhoku, Han'anchi, also sent envoys to Ming to tribute regional products and petitioned in a memorial for court caps, sashes, and robes in order to transform the national customs. The Ming Emperor granted this request. In the 11th year, kinoe-saru (1404), the Ming Emperor sent the Court Official Shi Zhong to conduct funeral rites for Satto and invested Bunei as King of Chūzan. The investiture document stated: "The rule of a sage king brings harmony to all nations, and the way of succession follows established precedent. The former King Satto of Ryukyu received his mandate from Our Imperial Father, the Taizu High Emperor, served as a shield in the eastern vassal territories, and was able to cultivate his duties as a subject. When We ascended to the throne, he took the lead in offering his sincerity. Now he has passed away. You, Bunei, are indeed his heir. We specifically invest you as King of Chūzan of the Ryukyu Kingdom to inherit that dynastic lineage. Practice frugality to cultivate yourself, reverence to nurture virtue, loyalty to serve your superiors, and benevolence to care for your subjects. Be capable of following this Way, pacifying the maritime domain, and ensuring prosperity for countless generations." After Satto established relations with Ming, tribute was frequently sent, and with Bunei, formal investiture was first received. This later became the established precedent. A new residence for the imperial envoys was built.

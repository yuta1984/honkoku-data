...and entered Ryukyu. The details of these events seem to be largely unclear. Recently, upon examining the History of the Ryukyu Kingdom, it records in considerable detail that Tametomo arrived in Ryukyu in the first year of Eiman (1165) and fathered Shunten. The national history also records that in the first year of Eiman, Tametomo reached Onigashima (Demon Island). In our country, Ryukyu was called Onigashima from ancient times. Thus we can know in detail that Tametomo arrived in Ryukyu and remained for several years, then later returned to Ōshima and committed suicide. Now, Tametomo was not only possessed of unparalleled martial prowess, but his filial piety, loyalty to friends, and compassionate love should perhaps be discussed alongside the famous generals of antiquity. Though Tametomo was unfortunate and unable to fulfill his ambitions within Japan proper, he established the foundation for thirty-six generations and 690 years of Ryukyu rule, with the royal lineage continuing to the present day. Are not his achievements also magnificent? That Heaven has not allowed his lineage to be cut off truly has good reason.

[Marginal note]
According to one theory, Tametomo did not actually die but escaped and entered Koryŏ (Korea).

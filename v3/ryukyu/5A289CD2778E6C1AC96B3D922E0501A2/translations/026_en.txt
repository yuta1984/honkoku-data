The Tenson Dynasty
In ancient times, Ryukyu was called Uruma Island. It was also called Uruma-no-kuni, Yakibi Island, and Akonaha Island (Ako is probably a mistake for Aoni, or it may be translated as Okinawa). The islands of the southern sea were also called Nantō (Southern Islands), and later the islands of Nantō, Shiraishi, Agoshima, Kuroshima, Iōjima and others were collectively called Kikaijima or Uoshima.

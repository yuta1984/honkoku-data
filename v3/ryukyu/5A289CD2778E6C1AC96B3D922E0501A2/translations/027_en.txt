This distance is 240 ri, located between 24 and 28 degrees north latitude and 120 to 130 degrees east longitude. What the Chinese called Nanwa was indeed Ryukyu. In that ancient primordial age, sea waves flooded the land making it impossible to dwell there. At that time, there were one man and one woman born in the great wilderness. The man was named Shinirekyu and the woman Amamiko. They controlled earth and stone, planted vegetation, prevented sea floods, lived in caves and the wild, hunted birds and beasts, and ate fruits. After many years had passed, a child of the heavenly emperor emerged to divide the groups and establish the people. The child of the heavenly emperor bore three sons and two daughters. The eldest son was called Tenson-shi and became the first ruler of the Ryukyu Kingdom. The second son became the founder of the aji (local lords), and the third son became the founder of the common people. The eldest daughter became the founder of the kimikimi (kimikimi is the title for women who hold priestly duties), and the second daughter became the founder of the noronoro (noronoro is also a title for those who hold priestly duties).

For the first time, the land was divided into three parts: Nakagami (namely Chuzan), Kunigami (namely Hokuzan), and Shimajiri (namely Nanzan). At this time, written contracts had not yet been created; they observed the waxing and waning of the moon to know the ten-day periods and new moons, and recorded the seasons by watching the growth and withering of grass. They taught the people farming and cooking, dried seawater to make salt, and extracted tree sap to make vinegar. Those who formerly covered their bodies with grass, leaves, bark, and fur now first had cloth garments. Those who formerly nested in trees and lived in caves now first had houses. The people's customs gradually changed and were no longer like the practices of former days. Here, they surveyed the land and built a capital city in Nakagami, naming it Shuri. They also demarcated fields, divided districts, and placed aji in the districts to govern the people. The customs of that time were simple and honest, the people's practices were upright and virtuous, and they served the gods with great reverence. Their heavenly deity was called Ufutsukakura-gami, and their sea deity was called Giraika-

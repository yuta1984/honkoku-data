[The Ōzato aji] called himself the King of Sannan (Southern Mountain). He ruled over eleven magiri (districts): Kanegusuku, Makabe, Kyan, Mabuni, Kochinda, Tomigusuku, Gushikami, Tamashiro, Chinen, Sashiki, and Amari (districts are called "magiri"). The Nakijin aji called himself the King of Sanhoku (Northern Mountain) and ruled over four magiri—Haneji, Nago, Kunigami, and Kin—as well as the two islands of Ie and Iheya. Chūzan retained only twelve magiri: Naha, Tomari village, Mawa, Haebaru, Nishihara, Urasoe, Chatan, Nakagusuku, Goeku, Yomitan, Katsuren, and Gushikawa. The warfare between the three kingdoms did not cease, and the various islands also did not come to pay tribute. Chūzan declined more and more. [King Tamashiro] was on the throne for twenty-three years and died on the eleventh day of the third month of the first year of En'gen, hinoe-ne (1336), at the age of forty-one.

King Saiō was Tamashiro's son, born in the third year of Karyaku, tsuchinoe-tatsu (1328). He ascended to the throne at the age of ten. His mother monopolized power, and the country fell into great disorder. Saiō was on the throne for thirteen years and died on the thirteenth day of the fourth month of the fourth year of Shōhei, tsuchinoto-ushi (1349). The people deposed the heir and established Satto, the aji of Urasoe, as king.

From Eiso to Saiō, five generations spanning approximately ninety years, the rule of Eiso's line came to an end.

King Satto

King Satto's name was Ōmamono, born in the first year of Genkō, kanoto-tori (1321). His father was called Okuma Ōoya. He was from Okuma in Jiana village, Urasoe magiri. For generations [his family] made agriculture their occupation. He married a certain woman and had Satto. When Satto grew up, he loved fishing and hunting and did not apply himself to agriculture. He constantly traveled in all directions and was quite dissolute. Ōoya was always worried about this. At this time, the Katsuren aji had one daughter who possessed both talent and beauty.

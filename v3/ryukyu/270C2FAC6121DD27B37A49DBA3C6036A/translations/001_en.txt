I humbly write to you.

Regarding the Lord (Taishū-sama), in recent years foreign ships have frequently come to Ryukyu, and due to these difficult times, he granted leave in the middle of this past first month.

As for the Shōshō-sama, upon his arrival at Edo Castle and his desire to perform sanpū (official attendance), as per his wish, it was commanded. On the 13th day of the first month, through an imperial messenger, leave was granted, and following precedent, gifts were bestowed from Udaishō-sama through an imperial messenger. On the 15th day, he attended the castle to express his gratitude, received gracious imperial favor, and was granted a horse. I have been informed of this and am truly filled with joy and reverence.

I wish to offer congratulatory words to Taishū-sama, and thus I present this humble letter to your honorable selves. With utmost reverence and fear, respectfully written.

16th day of the 4th month　　Yonabaru Ueekata

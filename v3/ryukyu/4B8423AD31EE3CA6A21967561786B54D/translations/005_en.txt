carve it and show it widely to people in all directions, hoping to delight the eyes of
the elderly and young who have difficulty walking around to see it themselves. Now, regarding these
illustrations of the procession, they are published with each imperial visit, but
they are all merely works aimed at profit, and there are none
that would serve as a proper means of seeing their actual appearance.
What I am now publishing is not of that sort. Having personally
heard and accurately observed and recorded it,
it should differ very little from what one might see
with one's own eyes. How wise this is!

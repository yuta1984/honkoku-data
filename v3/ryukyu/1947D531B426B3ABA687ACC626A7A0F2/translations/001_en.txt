I respectfully write this letter.
Regarding the marriage arrangements for Princess Chōki, when I offered my congratulations to His Lordship last year, I was graciously granted gifts as listed in the catalog, which I consider a most grateful blessing. I humbly request that you appropriately convey my gratitude for these gifts.
With utmost reverence and respect,

King of Chūzan
Second day of the fifth month　Shō Iku

Item: Regarding Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami bringing Ryukyuan people for his visit to Edo, [he inquired] whether the King of Chūzan's envoy should accompany him after their arrival, or whether he should proceed with his regular seasonal visit to Edo while having the envoy accompanied by retainers upon their arrival. Satsuma-no-kami submitted a formal inquiry regarding these two options through a written document. It was declared that retainers should accompany [the envoy] for the visit to Edo, and that postponing the sankin attendance would be acceptable.

Item: As the King of Chūzan died this summer, his legitimate grandson was made to succeed him. When there is a succession of the King of Chūzan, it has been customary to send an envoy, and congratulatory礼 for succession has been presented since ancient times. Therefore, this time too, a request was made to present congratulations through an envoy. If this is to be approved through official documentation, it would be treated the same as the envoy sent for the shogunal succession.

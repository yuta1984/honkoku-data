《His son Yoshimoto transferred the domain to the descendants of the Tensōshi lineage. The common belief that the current Ryukyu king is a blood relative of Tametomo is incorrect》 Chūryō considers that in the "Chūzan Denshin-roku," it is recorded that Shunten was a descendant of the Japanese imperial line and the son of Ōsato Aji Tomomichi. Ōsato is a place name, and Aji is an official title. 《Ōsato Aji was Tametomo's father-in-law. Or perhaps he transferred his position to his son-in-law. Aji is a position equivalent to Junior First Rank, like a territorial lord or feudal lord.》 Tomomichi probably omitted the "Tame" from Tametomo when being addressed. In Master Hakuseki's "Ryukyu Jiryaku," during the Eiman era under Emperor Nijō, Tametomo floated on the sea, followed the current seeking a country, and arrived at Ryukyu. 《It is said that the name was changed to Ryūkyū based on the meaning of "seeking by following the current." This theory is incorrect. This name existed before then.》 The people of the country feared and submitted to his martial prowess. He named the country Ryūkyū, eventually married the sister of Ōsato Aji and fathered King Shunten. Tametomo remained in this country for a long time, but his longing for his homeland became unbearable, and he eventually returned to Japan.

The record in "Wakan Sansai Zue" that after Tametomo's death, a shrine was erected with the divine title "Shunten Daijingū" is incorrect. Incidentally, when Tametomo was sixteen years old, like his father Rokujō Hangwan Tameyoshi, he sided with the Retired Emperor (Shin'in), but when the military was defeated, he was exiled to Izu Province. At twenty-nine, he crossed to Demon Island, and after returning to the country, due to complaints from the people, government troops were sent against him, and he committed suicide at thirty-three, as recorded in the "Hōgen Heiji Monogatari." Master Hakuseki's claim that what is called Demon Island in our country is indeed present-day Ryukyu—on what basis was this made? There is no evidence. In my humble opinion, the ancient name of this land is called Okino Island, or sometimes written with different characters as Akikino Island, leading to this association

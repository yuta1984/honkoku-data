(Continued note: Only by donating grain stores to assist them could they finally complete the ceremonies and return. In the jiawu mission, foreign ships engaged in trade from over ten countries, bringing abundant profits, so our people's gains were also plentiful. In the xinyou mission, foreign trading ships came from only three or four countries, with reduced profits, so our people's gains also decreased. In the jimao mission, trade restrictions were relaxed, foreign ships did not come, profits completely ceased, so our people's gains were extremely meager. Circumstances made it thus. Now in the 22nd year of Kangxi (1683), the guihai mission, maritime trade prohibitions are strict, and foreign countries compete to purchase Chinese goods. Islands near Ryukyu, such as Satsuma Province and the seven Tokara Islands, all come gathering upon hearing news, and their goods are traded and sold. This tradition among Fujian people continues to this day, so many volunteer for service. During long periods of peace, Ryukyu comes annually to trade Chinese goods, and there are many foreign countries. After this investiture ship arrived, not a single foreign vessel from Tokara and other places came. The country is inherently poor, most goods cannot be sold, and all personnel suffer hardship. By law, the profit-seeking activities of merchants should be prohibited. Those serving should reduce their retinue and equipment. This would both alleviate the material difficulties of the small nation and eliminate the covetous desires of the personnel. Perhaps both benefits could thus be achieved.)

Watches (Method for determining watches)
Distances traveled by ships at sea are all calculated by watches. Some say one hundred li makes one watch, others say sixty li makes one watch, still others say dividing day and night makes ten watches. When I asked the ship's chief mate, all said the sixty-li system was most accurate.

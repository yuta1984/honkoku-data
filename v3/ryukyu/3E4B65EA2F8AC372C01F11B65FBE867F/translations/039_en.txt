《Marginal note: One account says the goddess was born in the eighth year of Yuanyou under Emperor Zhezong. Another account says she was born in the year of Jiashen. Examining this, the goddess ascended and was transformed on the ninth day of the ninth month in the fourth year of Yongxi under Emperor Taizong of Song. She lived in the world for twenty》

《Marginal note: eight years, so the account of her birth in the first year of Jianlong should be considered correct. After birth, she did not cry even after a full month, so she was named Mo (Silent).》 From that time, she manifested divine responses. Sometimes she showed revelations through dreams, sometimes she displayed divine lanterns. The ships at sea that received her protection were countless. The local people together venerated her. In the fifth year of Xuanhe under Emperor Huizong of Song, Administrative Vice Director Lu Yundi was sent as an envoy to Goryeo. Seven of the eight ships were lost to drowning.

All enfeoffments originate from the initial title "Spiritual Benevolence." It should be written as "Spiritual Benevolence and Revered Fortune."

In general, when encountering dates of wind and storms, if not on the actual day, then it occurs within three days before or after. Also, the four constellations of Ji, Bi, Yi, and Zhen likewise govern the arising of winds. One should be cautious and avoid them all.

The "Wind Signal Investigation" up to this point is all based on what is recorded in the "Comprehensive Guide to Navigation," either adopting from books on taboos and divination, or deriving from records by sea captains and helmsmen. While the language is not entirely refined and elegant, when cross-referenced, it proves accurate in many cases. Now I append this to inform those who come after.

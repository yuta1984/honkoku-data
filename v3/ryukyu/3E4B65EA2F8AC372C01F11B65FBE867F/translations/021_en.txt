The old records say: throw a wooden float from the bow into the sea, and have a person quickly run to the stern. When the person and float arrive simultaneously, this is called "matching the watch." When the person arrives before the float, it means "not reaching the watch." When the person arrives after the float, it means "exceeding the watch." Now Western ships use glass hourglasses to determine watches. They are simple and easy to understand. Two glass bottles with narrow necks and large bellies—one bottle is filled with sand, the two openings are joined top and bottom, creating a single line for the sand to pass through. It is suspended above the compass. When the sand finishes passing through, this constitutes one "leak" (time unit). It is then inverted and suspended again. Calculating one day and night gives approximately twenty-four leaks. Each watch the ship travels sixty li, approximately two and a half leaks.

When a person arrives before the wooden float and does not reach the watch, the wind is gentle and the ship moves slowly. Although the time period is reached, it still has not covered sixty li—this is called "not reaching the watch." When a person arrives after the float, creating an "excess watch," the wind is strong and the ship moves quickly. When the time period is reached, it has already exceeded sixty li—this is called "exceeding the watch."

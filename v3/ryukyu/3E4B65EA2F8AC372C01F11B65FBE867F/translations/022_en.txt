Navigation Routes

Ryukyu lies in the sea, originally positioned east-west relative to Zhejiang and Fujian. However, the intervening area is flat and without mountains. When ships navigate at sea, they rely entirely on mountains as reference points. When traveling from Fuzhou to Ryukyu, one exits through Wuhu Gate and must take bearings on mountains such as Jilong and Pengjia. All these mountains are located to the south. Therefore, at summer solstice, riding the southwest winds and using compass directions such as chen and xun, one sails far to the south in a circuitous route, then gradually turns to head due east. When returning from Ryukyu to Fuzhou, one departs from Gumi Mountain and must take bearings on Nanqi Mountain near Wenzhou. This mountain is located to the northwest. Therefore, at winter solstice, riding the northeast winds and using compass directions such as qian and xu, one sails far to the north in a circuitous route, then gradually turns to head due west. Although the terrain of both places faces each other in an east-west direction, one cannot simply use the mao-you compass bearings to travel directly back and forth. This is because navigation relies on mountains as reference points, and sailing vessels must prioritize capturing favorable winds.

More than two hundred years later, during the reign of Shō Hashi in the Muromachi period, there finally came news of tribute missions. However, this was merely seeking profit through trade, and their conversion to civilization was not pure. Moreover, at that very time, the realm was in great turmoil, with warfare occurring daily - how could there have been leisure to inquire about foreign lands?

Eventually, when the Divine Ancestor (Tokugawa Ieyasu) pacified and unified the realm, and civilizing influence spread throughout, Korea had already submitted. Thereupon Lord Shimazu Iehisa displayed his military prowess and, following imperial orders, conducted a southern campaign. Where his military might pointed, [Ryukyu] fled in panic at the mere sight of his authority. He then drove straight into Chuzan, captured King Shō Nei, and brought him to the court.

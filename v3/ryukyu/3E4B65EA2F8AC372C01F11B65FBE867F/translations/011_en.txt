Again, envoys Xiao Chongye and Xia Ziyang were dispatched. All have records. However, the content overlaps between earlier and later accounts. In the sixth year of Chongzhen, the record by Hu Jing, a retainer of Du Sance, was particularly vulgar and unreliable. In the second year of Kangxi of our dynasty, Zhang Xueli of the Board of War wrote "Brief Records and Miscellaneous Notes" in two volumes, which was considerably more detailed than previous works. In the twenty-second year, Compiler Wang Ji authored "Records of Chuzan's Historical Changes" in two volumes and "Miscellaneous Records" in five volumes. The documentation was reliable and far superior to previous works.
However, regarding the administrative divisions of mountains and rivers, there are still omissions and oversimplifications. Customs, institutions, products, etc. are also not fully covered. This is because the mission period was urgent, and investigation and research were conducted hastily, resulting in errors in language and script between both sides. Therefore,
what was heard became distorted in transmission, lacking credibility. Now I, your subject,
received the imperial command to serve as deputy to Compiler Hai Bao and proceeded there. From the first day of the sixth month of the jihai year when we arrived in the country, we waited for favorable winds and passed over a year,
finally departing on the sixteenth day of the second month of the gengzi year. In total, we stayed in Chuzan for approximately eight months. During intervals between investiture ceremonies and
banquets, I first addressed the king, requesting to be shown the "Chuzan Seikan" and geographical records of mountains and rivers. I also
frequently exchanged with those officials who were versed in translation of scripts and terminology, and traveled extensively throughout the mountainous and coastal regions. The distant and near topography and
strategic positions were all within my observation. I examined their institutions and rituals, observed customs and inquired about practices. Down to the peculiar
forms of individual objects, I necessarily inquired about names to understand their reality. I cross-verified what I saw and heard, engaged in dialogue with them, removed doubts and preserved reliable information.
Thus I compiled the charts of sea routes and navigation, investiture banquet ceremonies and various ritual procedures into six volumes. Although I do not yet
dare to claim there are no errors or omissions, in terms of transmitting reliable information, this may perhaps come close. Moreover, the various official histories' records of foreign
countries are generally crude and sketchy. Now although Ryukyu is separated by the great ocean, newly measured by sundial, it lies
directly east-west of Fuzhou, merely 1,700 li away. Generation after generation has received investiture, year after year paying tribute. It is
no different from the interior territories. Upon humble observation,

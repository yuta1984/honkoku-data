(It can also be said. This is to prevent our country's precious goods from flowing out to foreign countries, and to gradually bring poor weak small countries into substantial submission.)
Although Ryukyu and Tang China are separated by distant sea routes, the Ming dynasty skillfully invited and made them submit, granted them the Thirty-Six Families, and made them follow the orthodox calendar. This achieved the general principle of territorial strategy. Ryukyu also studied the Way of the ancient sages, acquired writing, traded products, and was prudent and respectful. This was like when our country sent diplomatic envoys to the Tang court in ancient times. This is not the same argument as Korea's submission to Tang China. (The "Sangoku Tsūran" states: When Ryukyu sends envoys to Japan, they use Japanese era names; when sending envoys to Tang China, they use Tang Chinese era names. This is due to their insufficient national power. Also, they do not conceal from Japan their envoys to Tang China, but they conceal from Tang China their envoys to Japan. From this it could be said that Tang China's authority is heavier than Japan's. Upon examination, concealment is not due to fear but due to such circumstances, and non-concealment is not due to contempt but due to amicable relations. This is the same argument as when someone discussed Ryukyu's presentation of eunuchs mentioned in the historical records, saying that Ryukyu's fear of western expeditions should be understood.)

Ryukyu suffered conquest by Tang China during the 6th year of Daye under Emperor Yang of Sui (the 18th year of Empress Suiko, kanoe-uma, in our court). Military Commander Chen Ling led troops to attack that country, killed the king, and captured five thousand men and women alive. However, there are no records among the twenty-five generations of the Tenson dynasty. After that, five hundred and seventy-odd years later, in the 14th year of Chunxi under Emperor Xiaozong of Song (the 3rd year of Bunji under Emperor Go-Toba, hinoto-hitsuji, in our court), Shunten ascended the throne. This is considered the founding ancestor of the lineage. After that, in merely seventy-odd years, although Emperor Shizu of Yuan sent envoys to invite submission, they ultimately did not surrender. During the time of Emperor Taizu of Ming, King Satto first established relations. However, since investiture envoys faced the dangers of wind and waves, and the expenses of tribute ships were enormous, in Ming and Qing court discussions they requested that imperial edicts be entrusted to tribute envoys for return delivery. When Ryukyu requested investiture, they necessarily prepared for over ten years before sending envoys to request investiture, and during the investiture envoys' stay, seven banquets

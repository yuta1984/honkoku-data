anchored there. The river mouth interpreters escort the Ryukyu people into the Ryukyu lodging. This place is called Daibao境 (Daibao District). It is smaller than the Satsuma domain's Ryukyu lodging but quite exquisitely constructed. The Qing people who guard this lodging are called gate officials, consisting of two people—civil and military—each with five or six subordinate officials. Between the main gate and second gate of the lodging are the residences of these officials. After staying at the Ryukyu lodging for seven or eight months, during autumn and winter, around late September to early October, about twenty officials including the chief and vice envoys (according to the Denshinroku, two chief and vice envoys and fifteen attendants are permitted to enter Beijing) depart for Beijing. The rest all remain at the Ryukyu lodging to await the tributary mission's return the following year. The route to Beijing passes through Yanping, Jianning, Quzhou, Yanzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Jinan (Shandong), and other places. From Jianning Prefecture to Quzhou Prefecture is overland travel. From Yanzhou Prefecture to Yangzhou Prefecture is by waterway, and Shandong is overland.

The return journey from Shandong takes a different route with mostly waterways. The mountains and rivers seen during the journey are extremely spectacular and magnificent, difficult to capture with a brush and hard to describe in words. When passing through Shandong, for about four or five days no mountains are visible in any direction, showing how flat and vast it is. In Shandong the roads are flat and wide, and the wind is extremely strong. They raise sails on carts and race like boats. In each province, escort officials come out to accompany the tributary envoys. Five or six servants carry parasols and follow along. Each province plays music to welcome and send off the tributary envoys. During water travel, court musicians board the chief envoy's ship and play music. When the tributary envoys travel overland, all officials great and small ride in palanquins, while other servants ride horses or travel by cart. When the tributary envoy officials pass through, gatekeepers sound bronze gongs and fire cannons. The tributary envoys' journeys utilize the post-horse system, so

(Therefore there was no shortage of Chinese goods, so in this mission only six thousand gold was obtained. Jimao [1459] was the 3rd year of Tianshun when Emperor Yingzong was restored to the throne, during the reign of Shō Taikyū. Taikyū's investiture as king occurred in the 6th year of Jingtai, yihai [1455] under Emperor Jingtai. The investiture envoys probably arrived in Ryukyu in the 3rd year of Tianshun. This was the 3rd year of Chōroku in our court, when Shogun Yoshimasa frequently maintained friendly relations with Ming China, so only three thousand gold was obtained, greatly disappointing expectations. It seems that in the jiawu mission when over ten countries engaged in resale trade via foreign ships, the term "foreign ships" refers to Satsuma Province or its tributary islands, so their profits were substantial. In the xinyou mission there were only three or four countries, so profits were already small. In the jimao mission, restrictions on foreign trade were relaxed, so profits were suddenly cut off. The relaxation of restrictions on foreign trade refers to how Shogun Yoshimochi had stopped friendly relations with Ming China following his father's dying wishes, but during Yoshinori's time diplomatic inquiries resumed, and subsequently during Yoshimasa's time tribute ships were sent yearly in friendship, with exchanges between Japan and Ming - this is called relaxation of restrictions on foreign trade. Therefore profits from Ryukyu trade were suddenly cut off. After that, since official trade began with Ming trade tallies [kangō], the southern islands of Kyushu probably no longer came to Ryukyu for resale trade. Later, the guihai mission in the 22nd year of Kangxi [1683] was when the Sacred Ancestor invested Shō Tei as king, corresponding to the 3rd year of Tenna in our court. Although the Qing had unified China at that time, Zheng Jing in Taiwan honored the Ming calendar and did not surrender, and since the coasts were not peaceful, commercial shipping was prohibited. For this reason, seeking Chinese goods for profit, Satsuma Province, the Tokara Seven Islands, and others all came to engage in trade and obtained great profits.)

(It is said they obtained [profits]. In the 21st year of Kangxi [1682], Zheng Jing's son Kezhuang surrendered, Taiwan entered Qing territory, and since the sea routes became peaceful, the Qing Emperor permitted maritime trade. Merchant ships from Fuzhou and Nanjing entered Nagasaki yearly, and there was nothing lacking among the precious goods, rare vessels, and luxury items from all nations. Later, quotas were established for merchant ships from Fujian and Zhejiang entering port, and the annual quotas were reduced. Therefore, when Shō Kei was invested in the 58th year [Kangxi 58, 1719], not one foreign ship from Tokara and other places came. Since Ryukyu was inherently poor, goods could not be sold and both people and servants fell into poverty. This year corresponds to the 4th year of Kyōhō, jihai [1719] in our court. At that time, since the outflow of gold, silver, and copper to foreign countries was enormous, the annual merchant ship quotas were further reduced, private maritime commerce was strictly prohibited, and trade in Chinese goods between Satsuma and Ryukyu was stopped, so not one foreign ship came. Therefore, although Ryukyu tribute envoys thereafter requested to make tribute once yearly as they had from the former Ming period until the early Qing period, following previous precedent they made tribute once every two years. This was called "full tribute" and "reduced tribute," and they were exempted from sending tribute ships annually, entirely because merchant ships from Fujian and Zhejiang entering port were gradually reduced, probably to allow Ryukyu ships to trade with our country. Thus in full tribute years it was one thousand kan of silver, in reduced tribute years it was five to six kan, all being old silver and ganzi silver of our country. I have heard privately that recently the goods that Ryukyu people trade in Satsuma amount to about thirty thousand gold. Of those goods, seven or eight parts out of ten are Chinese goods while Ryukyu goods are few. In recent times the prohibition on Satsuma-Ryukyu trade has become strict, and in some years goods worth thirty thousand gold are burned and discarded.)

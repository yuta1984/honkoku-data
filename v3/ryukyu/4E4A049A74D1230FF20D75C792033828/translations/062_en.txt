Imperial Edict to Shō Kei, heir and great-grandson of the King of Chūzan, Ryukyu Kingdom: You dwell far in the corners of the sea, yet diligently fulfill your tributary duties. As the heir apparent, you should rightfully succeed your ancestors. Since you have not yet received the imperial mandate, you dare not act presumptuously, but respectfully follow established protocols and submit a memorial requesting investiture. We recognize that your family has maintained loyal vassalage for generations, and your faithfulness is commendable. We specially dispatch Chief Envoy Hai Bao of the Hanlin Academy and Deputy Envoy Xu Baoguang of the Hanlin Academy, bearing this edict to invest you as King of Chūzan, Ryukyu Kingdom. We also bestow upon you and your consort various silk fabrics and other goods. You should respectfully receive this imperial favor, diligently continue your ancestors' legacy, harmonize your subjects, carefully guard your territory, thereby securing your ancestral shrines in your native land, and forever serve as a bulwark for the Celestial Dynasty. Be reverent! Do not violate Our commands. Thus We decree.

Gifts bestowed upon the King: 2 pieces of python-patterned silk, 3 pieces of blue patterned silk, 3 pieces of indigo patterned silk, 3 pieces of plain indigo silk, 2 pieces of flash silk, 2 pieces of plain clothing silk, 3 pieces of cotton, 4 pieces of gauze, 4 pieces of thin silk, 4 pieces of pongee.

Gifts bestowed upon the Consort: 2 pieces of blue patterned silk, 2 pieces of indigo patterned silk, 1 piece of ornamental silk, 2 pieces of plain indigo silk, 1 piece of flash silk, 2 pieces of plain clothing silk, 2 pieces of brocade, 2 pieces of gauze, 4 pieces of thin silk.

57th year of Kangxi reign, 8th month, [day]

Regarding the Seal of the King of Ryukyu:
The inscription consists of six characters reading "Seal of the King of Ryukyu," with Manchu script on the left and seal script on the right, not referring to Chūzan.

Investiture Envoy Xu Baoguang noted that the edict of the first year of Kangxi stated: "dispatch officials bearing the edict and seal to invest [him] as King of Chūzan, Ryukyu Kingdom."

In that case, the seal inscription should read "Seal of the King of Chūzan, Ryukyu Kingdom," which would correspond with the edict text. However, considering that in the 16th year of Hongwu of the former Ming dynasty, a gilt silver seal was first bestowed upon King Satto, and in the 18th year, camel-knob silver seals were also bestowed upon the Kings of Nanzan and Hokuzan respectively, at that time the kingdom was divided into three parts, and Satto possessed only Chūzan, so he should naturally have been called King of Chūzan. Now Ryukyu has already unified Nanzan and Hokuzan for over three hundred years, yet the kingdom still retains the designation of only the Chūzan region. This likely follows the old precedent of the former Ming, but there is doubt about showing such self-limitation. Judging by propriety, it would be proper to simply call it "King of Ryukyu Kingdom" as on the imperial seal.

Note: The printed seal-script hundred-style thousand-character text of the Kangxi period was compiled by Mao Yuan You Huian, and You Zheng's clean-written thousand-character text follows the style of Manchu on the left and seal script on the right.

According to the Chuzan Seikan (Annals of Chuzan): 《Marginal note: According to the Denshinroku (Records of Diplomatic Missions), this book was written by Sho Shoken (styled Bun'ei), a cousin of Sho Shitsu. When the Chinese envoy came to invest King Sho Tei, this book was still incomplete. Since the opening of Chuzan》
《Marginal note: up to Shunten, there were no written characters for the first time. Not until Sho Shoken did someone thoroughly investigate and broadly collect materials to complete this book》The ancestor of Ryukyu is considered to be the Tenson-shi (Heavenly Grandson clan). Initially there were one man and one woman, born in the great wilderness, who became husband and wife, called Amamikyu. They bore three sons and two daughters. The eldest son became the Tenson-shi, the beginning of the rulers. The second son became the beginning of the feudal lords, and the third son became the beginning of the common people. The eldest daughter was called Kimikimi, and the second daughter was called Noronoro, who became the guardian deities of the country. One became a heavenly god, and one became a sea god. The Tenson-shi lasted twenty-five generations. Their family names cannot be verified today. Therefore, this is abbreviated, beginning in the year of己丑 and ending in 丙午. Altogether 17,802 years. Now we cut this short and begin from Shunten.

They grew weary of spending [accumulated wealth] to conduct investiture ceremonies, and if the small kingdom gradually weakened and became unable to achieve independence, it would truly become our vassal island nation - this could be said to have achieved a far-sighted plan through the single measure of stopping Satsuma-Ryukyu trade. (Popular talk says "Because goods from Tang China entering Satsuma through Ryukyu caused fewer ships to enter Nagasaki, the magistrate's notification led to the cessation of Satsuma-Ryukyu trade one by one" - this comes from the theories of greedy merchants who know nothing of the broader strategic picture.)

In Keichō 14 (1609), after Shimazu Mutsu-no-kami Iehisa received imperial command and conducted the conquest of Ryukyu, [Ryukyu] has belonged to Satsuma and has not neglected sending envoys. Previously, envoys to Kyoto and the Shogun's house were senior officials, but in the present era princes serve as chief envoys and親方 (親方) serve as vice-envoys. For tribute missions to Tang China, the耳目官 (jimokukan) and正議大夫 (shōgi-daifū) serve as chief and vice envoys, and for gratitude missions, the王舅 (ōkyu, king's brother-in-law) serves as chief envoy. Compared to our country's ancient envoys to Tang China, Ming, and Qing,

it could be said that the current威権 (authority/prestige) is quite strong. At that time the Ming dynasty was in decline, and the investiture envoys feared the dangers of the sea route. If a proposal arose to bestow edicts upon tribute envoys, [Japan] should stop Tang China's investiture, offer up the national seal to receive and distribute the正朔 (calendar), destroy the heavenly envoy's館 (residence), change those customs, and make [Ryukyu] subordinate to Satsuma - then it would truly become a vassal state. Now that the Qing dynasty follows the precedents of the former Ming, making distant countries submit and request investiture and calendars shows ignorance of strategic arts. Some say that Takeshima, an outlying island of Oki Province, was seized by Korea, and because the vermillion seal document for Takeshima granted to the lord of Inshū was revoked, the Koreans prevailed as they wished and Japan lost one island of its territory. Therefore, not only the samurai of Tsushima but even monks and laypeople [lamented that] through Jōken-in-dono's edict, they lost ancestral lands without reason.

History of Ryukyu Changes, Volume 2　　　　【Library seal】Hōchin Bunko

　　Royal Crown and Robes
The crown and robes of the King of Ryukyu use the style bestowed by the Ming Dynasty and have not been changed to this day.
The court ministers also have crown and robes bestowed by the Ming, but since the current Qing Dynasty,
they are not permitted to wear them. Only the king is allowed to wear Ming-style crown and robes.

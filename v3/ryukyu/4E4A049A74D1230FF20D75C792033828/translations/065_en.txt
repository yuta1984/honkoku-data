They created welcome songs for the gods and celebrated with them. Afterward, the gods ceased to appear frequently, but the remaining melodies of the divine songs still exist to this day. Whenever there is a royal enthronement or celebratory event, these are always performed. Previously, after former kings received investiture, when banqueting the heavenly envoys, these were performed first as custom. An old man character is created who ascends the stage and, without musical accompaniment, sings divine songs from behind a curtain, offering prayers for the emperor's longevity and peace throughout the realm. Next, he praises how the king shares in divine blessings, and that now, during this auspicious Mid-Autumn Festival, with the heavenly envoys' arrival, it is a day when both true spirits and humans rejoice together. Respectfully following precedent, the divine songs are sung first, with the white-haired old man performing a hundred prostrations and kowtows, reverently praising the emperor's benevolence as vast as heaven and the king's eternal reign. After the old man finishes singing, he bows and withdraws. Next, dozens of talented young relatives and retainers are dressed in colorful robes and, in successive groups, sing songs of great peace to provide entertainment for the banquet.

First there are six musicians who produce sounds like Buddhist chanting without instrumental accompaniment. Next, one person wearing a longevity star mask ascends the stage to harmonize with them. He performs three prostrations, rubs his hands together, rises and dances, then performs three more prostrations before stopping. Next come fourteen musicians wearing various colored red and green robes, with six-sided hat brims that press low on their heads, or wearing swallow-tail green kerchiefs, carrying musical instruments (two three-stringed instruments, one zither, one flute, one small gong, two drums). They ascend the stage in two rows front and back, kneel facing upward, raise their voices and sing in long drawn-out tones. When the curtain is raised, there are eight dances performed by young boys.

After the dancing concludes, as evening approaches, the curtains and drapes are removed, dozens of fireworks displays are set up in the courtyard, and several people wearing fire caps ride artificial horses with fireworks bursting simultaneously from head to tail, racing around the courtyard for entertainment. When this concludes and they exit the castle, several thousand torch bearers holding torches about two zhang long line both sides of the road to escort them back to the envoys' quarters. This is called the Third Banquet.

Dragon Pond is located north of the royal palace and west of Enkaku Temple. It is about half a li long and several dozen mu wide, with clear still water that connects with the lotus pond of Enkaku Temple. It is said to be where the downstream waters of Zuisen spring converge. The southern shore is called Sacred Peak. Banana trees grow densely, blocking sunlight and moonlight, creating a emerald

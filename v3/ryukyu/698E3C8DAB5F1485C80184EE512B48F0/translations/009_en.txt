addressed to Japan's King Minamoto no Yoshinori (this was in the eighth year of Eikyō). In the third year of Jiajing, according to the words of Ryukyu's chief administrator Jin Liang, prior to this, one Zheng Sheng, a Grand Master for Deliberation, was sent to convey [Ming imperial messages] to the King of Japan (this was in the fourth year of Daiei) (as recorded in the Chuzan denshin-roku and Ryukyu kokushi-ryaku). Therefore, it appears that when the Ming sent letters to our country, they sometimes commanded Ryukyu envoys [to deliver them].

Ryukyu Becomes a Vassal of Satsuma

Lord Ashikaga Yoshimitsu's son, Daikaku-ji monzeki Gishō Dai-sōjō, harbored treasonous plans and went down to Kyushu. When this matter was exposed, he hid in Eitoku-ji temple in Fukushima, Hyuga Province, relying on rōnin warriors and such. When Ashikaga Yoshinori learned of this, he commanded Satsuma's lord, Shimazu Mutsu-no-kami Tadakuni, to attack him. On the thirteenth day of the third month of Kakitsu 1, he sent Kabayama [given name unclear] with many soldiers as an attacking force. The sōjō committed suicide, and his head was immediately sent to the shōgun. The sōjō's retainer, one Betsudare Sanuki-bō, was also killed at the same time, it is said. As a reward for this service, the lord of Satsuma was given orders to conduct diplomatic relations and trade with the Kingdom of Ryukyu

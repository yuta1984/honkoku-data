at an unknown distance of many thousands of ri, there was an island that appeared like smoke and mist." Based on this account, they sent He Man together with Zhu Kuan, and they finally reached the Ryukyu Kingdom. However, since the languages did not communicate, they captured one person from that country and returned. After this time, they again sent Zhu Kuan to pacify them, but they still did not submit. Zhu Kuan merely took their cloth armor and returned. At that time, an envoy from our country happened to be in China and, seeing this cloth armor, said, "This is something used by people from the country of Iyaku (Yakushima)." Although it is said that there are no records of these matters in our country, considering this, it can be understood that Ryukyu, together with the people of Yakushima, had early exchanges with our country. In the historical records, it is noted that people from Yaku came in the 24th year of Emperor Suiko's reign. This year corresponds to the 12th year of the Daye era of the Sui Dynasty. Had Ryukyu people come to our country together with the Yaku people before this time? If not, it would not accord with the words our countrymen answered to the Sui people at the beginning of the Daye era. Therefore, although the name of Ryukyu is not recorded in our national histories, we should consider that tributary presentations to the court had already occurred before Emperor Suiko's reign.

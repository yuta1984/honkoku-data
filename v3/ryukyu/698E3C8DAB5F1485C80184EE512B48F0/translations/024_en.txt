In "Honchō Reisō," it is also recorded as "people of Uryeong Island of Silla Kingdom." This makes it very clear that it is not Ryukyu. Maeda Kain states that "Uruma" is the Korean pronunciation of "Uryeong."

Refutation of the claim that Ryukyu envoys came during the Eikyō period

"Muromachi Kiryaku" records that in the seventh month of Eikyō 11, this year the Ryukyu Kingdom offered tribute 《marginal note: first recorded instance of Ryukyu tribute》. Also, "Ryukyu Jiryaku" states that in the seventh month of Hōtoku 3 during the reign of Emperor Go-Hanazono, Ryukyu people came and presented Shogun Yoshimasa with one thousand kan of coins and regional products 【left annotation: "products of that country"】. From this time onward, people from that country came to the port of Hyōgo to engage in trade. If this is so, then the arrival of envoys from that country to our court should be considered to have begun during the time of Shō Kinpuku. All these theories are erroneous. Upon examination, "Chūzan Denshinroku" states that in Xuande 7, Emperor Xuanzong, noting that among foreign tributaries Japan alone had not yet arrived, commanded the court official Chaishan to carry an imperial edict to the Ryukyu Kingdom, ordering the king to dispatch people to Japan to persuade them. This actually corresponds to our Eikyō 4. Therefore, what is described in the two books occurred after this time, so it should be understood that this was not the beginning.

There is an utaki (sacred place) on the highland of a corner of the castle ruins. The castle's stone gate is arch-shaped, from the 15th-16th centuries ○○. In the ruins of the old Chinen village below the castle, stone walls and gate remains survive, and the residential sites have become fields. The current village has moved to the eastern area.

It should be most prevalent in villages and urban lower classes, but the facts are the opposite. However, this does not mean there is absolutely no fear of dead spirits.

There were not a few yuta (spiritual mediums) and sanseiso (fortune-tellers) who lived hidden among the people, making their living by utilizing dead spirits. Since the content of superstitions is often related to fear of dead spirits, Orikuchi's theory cannot be completely denied. However, it cannot be ignored that the clients of yuta and sanseiso are mostly women. The fact that those with sound common sense base themselves on the filial piety of Confucian morality will be discussed later.

Indigenous faith lacks moral elements and is ○○ of a low-culture society, so it naturally declines parallel to cultural development, and moral elements gain power - this is the natural course of events. Signs of decline already began from the time of the rise of warriors (Aji) in the 12th century.

Among the warriors, there were even those who occupied utaki believed to be sacred groves and built castles there, seizing control of each village from the traditional root people. Chinen Morigusku and Shuri Morigusku mean mountain castles, but genetically, many were reconstructions of utaki into castles. Some built utaki within castles after constructing the castles. Subsequently, the priestesses became servants of the rulers. However, as long as nothing emerged to replace this faith,

it would not become extinct, and all rituals, beginning with agricultural ceremonies, were conducted by them. The warriors appointed their blood relatives or family members as high-ranking priestesses to preside over rituals.

The priestesses of the previous era were called negami (root gods), and the priestesses of this era were called noro. Negami were naturally occurring, and their area of responsibility was one village. In contrast, noro were responsible for several villages, and their emergence was through appointment by higher rulers. Once appointed as noro, blood relatives would hereditarily inherit that ○.

They could not abandon the custom whereby sisters, through their unique sensitivity, comprehended divine will and assisted their brothers' endeavors - the so-called onari-gami (unai-gami) faith.【(3)】

However, they were placed under the control of military rulers and denied their own ○○, so it can be said they were already standing one step before decline.

　　　　II　Policies of Oppressing Indigenous Faith

Buddhism was transmitted to Okinawa Island around the middle of the 13th century, and the first unified kingdom was established in 1429.

During this dynasty, the construction of Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines was actively carried out. In the

【Left Page Lower Section】
midst of frequent exchanges with China, Chinese who believed in Taoism also immigrated.

The next dynasty, like the previous one, devoted efforts to the prosperity of Buddhism. King Sho Shin (1477-1526) unified all the islands and conducted centralized government. He built Buddhist temples such as Engakuji and Sogenji and converted to Buddhism.

There is an inscription called "Hyakuurasoezuraganmei" that records his achievements. His first achievement was "believing in Buddha and creating images, building temples and establishing golden Buddha pavilions... this is the heart of the ancient Han Ming and Liang Wu emperors." The second was "facing the people and correcting ritual propriety, benefiting the people ○○ ○○... ○○○○ matters. Therefore, ○people ○ treat them like ○○, and thousands of officials treat them intimately like parents, upper and lower are harmonious, is this not ○?" 

That is, he is considered to have converted to Buddhism and also made Confucian ethics his political guideline. At the end of the inscription, it records "the ruler is sage and has ○, the retainer is loyal and has merit," expressing the Confucian ideal image of ruler and retainer. Subsequently, Okinawa's political leaders idealized not heroes and champions backed by military force, nor their deified versions, but sage gentlemen. Examples include Sage Aji (Regent Sho Kyo of King Sho Shitsu) and Gentleman Oyakata (Yonahara Yoshinori, sanshikan under King Sho Boku).【(4)】

On the other hand, King Sho Shin organized noro throughout all the islands, made his sister "Kikoe-ogimi," and appointed three priestesses under her, throughout all Ryu-

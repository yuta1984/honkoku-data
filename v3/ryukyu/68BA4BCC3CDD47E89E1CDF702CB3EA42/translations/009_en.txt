intertwined with these, and because it was closely connected to people's daily lives, it stubbornly continued to survive despite being spiritually hollow.
　Taking a bird's-eye view of religion in the late dynasty period, the ideals of politics and education were Confucian, while household religion could be described as Confucian ancestor worship clothed in Buddhist garb. Buddhism was also believed in, and shrines from mainland Japan were revered, but their penetration was shallow.
　Indigenous faith, as mentioned above, was rendered powerless and rejected in the political sphere, yet the court priestess system continued, and it survived particularly in women's societies unconnected to writing and in rural societies, supported by their conservatism. Taichū's "Record of Ryukyu Shinto" contains only brief descriptions of indigenous faith, but observers and researchers from the Meiji period onward did not focus on living faith and tended to obsess over fossilized forms.
　With the abolition of domains and establishment of prefectures in Meiji 12 (1879), high-ranking priestesses including the Kikoe-ōgimi with over 400 years of tradition were abolished, and over 300 local noro also lost their official character with the land reorganization of Meiji 26 (1893). However, they continued to conduct various ceremonies afterward, though they lost their privileges in taxation and other matters. During the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa periods, indigenous faith gradually declined, but it received a devastating blow in the recent great war and has almost completely vanished from Okinawa main island,

surviving only in the surrounding islands and the Miyako and Yaeyama island groups. The following causes can be cited:
　1. The utaki considered sacred places were almost completely destroyed - by artillery shells, trees cut down because they became military land, etc.
　2. Due to village relocations and dispersions and regroupings, priestess-centered festivals became impossible to conduct.
　3. Rice varieties completely changed, and traditional annual events fell into disuse.
　Besides such external conditions, the fundamental factor is the increase in criticism and distrust toward indigenous faith due to the spread of education. Let me cite two or three notable examples.
　Seiha utaki (Chinen village), considered Ryukyu's premier sacred site, has become a base for tourists carrying cameras and portable radios, and the flat areas within the castle grounds have been converted to sweet potato fields. I attempted discussions with young men and women working in the fields, but for them, talk of sacred sites was merely irrational old tales.
　The Nakijin Aoriyae (Nakijin village) was a high-ranking priestess in the northern region, and until before the war, there was an unmarried priestess. Her photograph appears in Shimabukuro Genshichi's "Folk Customs of Yambaru" and Iha Fuyū's "Politics of Ancient Ryukyu." In the recent great war, the Aoriyae's house burned down, the residential site became a sweet

potato field, and she herself has retreated to an urban area. The observation is that she has been freed from a dreary life and is probably enjoying human happiness.
　The house of the Nakijin noro escaped war damage, still possesses hereditary comma-shaped beads, and is said to conduct festivals at Nakijin Castle. The husband farms, and the wife who is the noro guides visitors around the castle ruins by request and earns some income. However, this couple lived in Osaka for a long time and are post-war repatriates.

is the noro of Nangusuku in Nago village, who works at an ironworks.
　After the war, I interviewed more than ten noro, but what supports them is their lack of courage to break traditional customs and the small income from festivals.
　Okinawa Island has become entirely militarized, and parallel to this, it is rapidly modernizing. Performing arts and entertainment that were originally connected to ancient rituals have branched off from ritual worship, surviving in independent forms, or are being revived with new presentations.

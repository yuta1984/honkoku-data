to be entrusted to Japan, requesting to borrow military equipment.

Shō Sadamune, son of Shō Shitsu, succeeded to the throne. Prior to this, Ming's Zheng Jing {{Marginal note: son of [Zheng] Chenggong}} established himself in Taiwan, and his forces seized Ryukyuan ships. Ryukyu appealed to the shogunate through the Shimazu clan. Later, when Taiwanese ships arrived at Nagasaki, the Nagasaki magistrate collected 300 kan of compensation silver and gave it to Ryukyu. Zheng Jing was displeased. By chance, a ship from Ōshū drifted to Taiwan, and Zheng Jing provided supplies and sent it back. The shogunate praised his generous gesture, bestowed silver upon him, and also entrusted him to return the previous Ryukyuan captives. In Enpō 2 {{Marginal note: [Emperor] Reigen}}, General Yang Ying of Taiwan sent a letter to the Nagasaki magistrate saying: "Japan maintains friendship with our country, and we are like one family to each other. With Ryukyu it is not the same. When people of Japan drift here by wind, they should naturally be sent back - how could there be reason to receive thanks? The original silver can be returned. Those Ryukyuan ships that pay tribute to the Qing are in Qing territory - who can distinguish them as Ryukyuan ships? Ryukyu had neither ships coming for communication nor letters explaining the situation, yet they made accusations with clever words, causing Japan to withhold our silver and injuring neighborly relations. The fault lies with them. If Ryukyu had come to explain, our domain would not have begrudged their return either. We respectfully entrust the original 2,000 ryō of silver to the official merchant Satsu Miyaku and request that this be conveyed to the Shogun."

Shō Kei, great-grandson of Shō Sadamune, possessed filial virtue and devoted himself to governance. In the era of his great-great-grandson, the current king Shō Tai, in Kaei 6, American envoy Perry arrived at Naha, and the following year finally concluded a treaty before departing. ○After the Meiji Restoration, in Meiji 4, domains were abolished and replaced with prefectures, and the Ryukyu islands came under the jurisdiction of Kagoshima Prefecture. In the autumn of the fifth year, envoys paid court. The Imperial Court especially elevated that country to domain status and bestowed upon Shō Tai the rank of domain lord and kazoku nobility.

From Shō En to the current king spans eighteen generations over four hundred-odd years.

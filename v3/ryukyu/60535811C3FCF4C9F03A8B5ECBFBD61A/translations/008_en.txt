belong to Kagoshima Prefecture. The total area of the three island groups combined is four hundred forty-six square ri.

Central Islands　Located in the central part, with over twenty islands. However, Okinawa is particularly large, while all others are small islands.

Okinawa Island is called Dai-Ryukyu Island (Great Ryukyu Island). It is positioned in the center of the Ryukyu Islands and is the largest, being the main island of the capital. It extends from 26 degrees 5 minutes to 26 degrees 50 minutes north latitude, and from 127 degrees 40 minutes to 128 degrees 20 minutes east longitude. The island's shape is coiled and winding, resembling a dragon, stretching from northeast to southwest. It is roughly twenty-five to twenty-six ri long, with a width of ten ri at the broadest points and one to two ri at the narrowest, with a circumference of seventy to eighty ri and an area of approximately one hundred sixty square ri. A small mountain range runs through the island, with five peaks—Kaso, Nago, Onna, Bendake, and Hachigashira—overlapping among them. Generally, there are many mountains and valleys with few broad plains, and the springs and streams are also short and steep. Shuri lies in the southern part and serves as the capital of the islands. Naha and Unten are two good ports in the south and north respectively, facilitating maritime transport. The island is divided into three provinces, thirty-nine magiri, and three hundred eighty-three villages (provinces are like counties, and magiri are like townships).

It is called Chuzan or Nakagami Province. Located in the central part of the island, it is biased toward the south. It comprises eighteen magiri: Shuri, Naha, Kume, Tomari, Mawashi, Haebaru, Kochinda, Nishihara, Urasoe, Ginowan, Nakagusuku, Chatan, Yomitanzan, Katsuren, Yonagusuku, Goeku, Misato, and Gushikawa (however, the four places of Shuri, Naha, Kume, and Tomari are not called magiri), governing a total of two hundred and two villages.

Shuri is the capital of Ryukyu, located in the southern part of Chuzan at 26 degrees 14 minutes north latitude and 127 degrees 52 minutes 1 second east longitude. The land consists of sloping flat mountain cliffs, opening to the southwest, with the capital area extending about half a ri in each direction. The roads are wide

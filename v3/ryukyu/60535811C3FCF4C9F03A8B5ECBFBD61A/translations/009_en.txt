The roads are well-maintained, and the commercial houses and residences are covered by high fences and dense trees. The royal castle is located at the central mountaintop, with outer walls built of crushed limestone. The circumference is about fifteen chō, and the palace is magnificent and beautiful. The main hall follows Chinese architectural style, while all others are built in the style of mainland Japan, but with many column foundations and low ridgepoles to protect against typhoons. There are many temples and gardens in the capital. Engaku-ji Temple houses the chief priests of King Shō En and his successors, while Tenkai-ji Temple contains their mausoleums. West of the capital is Mount Ben, where female priests of the Tenson clan are enshrined on the mountaintop. It is one of the five sacred peaks.

Naha is located about one ri southwest of Shuri, at 26 degrees 13 minutes north latitude and 127 degrees 41 minutes 15 seconds east longitude. It is Ryukyu's premier port, consisting of inner and outer harbors. Ships from mainland Japan and various regions gather here, and the nearby scenery is extremely beautiful. The urban area extends about fifteen chō in each direction, with the front facing south toward the inner harbor and hills in the back facing the outer harbor. The city center is somewhat prosperous, with government offices, shrines, Buddhist temples, and lodgings for Qing dynasty envoys, all magnificently built. Fortifications are built on the left and right west of the city streets, with tidal waters flowing between them and entering southward to form a lake-like inner harbor. The circumference is about one ri and extremely shallow, with the northern part being two to three fathoms deep, capable of anchoring twenty to thirty large Japanese ships. Ships from mainland Japan regularly anchor there in large numbers. A small fort has been built in the lake. The outer harbor is formed by opposing headlands on the southeastern mainland creating a bay, with the northwest directly connected to the open ocean. There is a row of massive reefs at the harbor entrance, forming a natural breakwater. The harbor shape is excellent, and several Western ships can anchor safely even during major typhoons. However, due to the reefs, entering and exiting the harbor entrance is considered most difficult. The deepest part of the harbor is seventeen to eighteen fathoms, and the tidal waters are said to be extremely clear.

Kume is adjacent to the northeast of Naha. All the villagers are descendants of people who came from Fujian during the Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty

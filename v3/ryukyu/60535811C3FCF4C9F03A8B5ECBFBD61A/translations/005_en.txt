are too numerous to enumerate, but some contain errors and falsehoods, while others are obsolete. Although this work separately cites approximately thirty to forty volumes, I do not list each title individually here.
1. Generally speaking, all Japanese and Chinese maps contain errors. Regarding places like the seven islands of southern Satsuma, few have described them in detail until now. While Western maps are undoubtedly more precise, even they have not yet achieved complete accuracy for remote places like the small islands of the Ryukyu archipelago in the far East. I have now consulted Inō's surveyed maps and a German map, cross-referencing them with various other maps to produce this map. In this work, I devoted my greatest efforts to the cartography.
1. The sections on climate, geology, products, agriculture and industry, education, customs, etc. should be understood as primarily concerning Okinawa Island. Each island is listed under its respective entry. However, some are discussed in general terms while others appear mixed together. These should be cross-referenced with each other.
1. The measurements of the circumference of the various islands record only approximate figures. The distances between islands are omitted and not recorded, but can be calculated based on longitude and latitude. One degree of latitude equals slightly more than 28 ri; for longitude in the Ryukyu region, one can obtain the approximate distance by calculating it the same as latitude. The longitude is based on calculations from Greenwich, England.
1. The names of the months for the four seasons follow the old calendar system, as there was no time to revise them. Place names and personal names are marked with simple vertical lines on both sides. Accounts of the creation of the world and the historical chronicles of Tameomo are recorded as folk traditions and appended at the end of the volume.

He cultivated virtue. In Shōhei 5, he ascended the throne, and the country was stable. In Bunchū 1, the Ming emperor Zhu Yuanzhang sent an envoy to invite submission. King Satto of Chūzan then sent an embassy to Ming. This marks the beginning of Ryukyu's diplomatic relations with Tang-tu (China). In Kōwa 3, King Shō Satto of Sannan and King Haneishi of Sanhoku also both sent embassies to Ming. In Genchū 7, Miyako and Yaeyama islands submitted. In the ninth year, Chūzan and Sannan together sent talented students to the Ming Imperial Academy. This marks the beginning of people from the country studying abroad in Tang-tu. This practice continued without interruption thereafter. Satto's son Bunei brought disorder to the government. Shō Shishō rose to replace him. Satto's rule ended after two generations and fifty-six years.

Shō Shishō was initially the Sashiki aji under the Sannan king. His son Shō Hashi inherited the position and had virtue and reputation. At this time, the Sannan king was arrogant and tyrannical. Hashi raised a righteous army and attacked him. In Ōei 12, he destroyed Bunei, installed his father Shishō as king. In the twenty-third year, he destroyed Sanhoku, and in Eikyō 1, he destroyed Sannan. From the time of Tamaki's reign, the country had been divided into three for over a hundred years, involving more than seventy battles, but in Shō Hashi's time, it was unified again. However, he never changed the title of Chūzan king. When Hashi ascended the throne, he had wise virtue. In Eikyō 2, the Ming emperor first granted the surname Shō. In the fourth year, Hashi forwarded a letter from the Ming emperor to Shogun Ashikaga Yoshinori. In the eighth year, he forwarded another. Hashi's son Shō Chū succeeded him. In Kakitsu 1, before this, Shogun Yoshinori's brother Yoshiaki had plotted rebellion and was in Fukushima in Hyūga. Shimazu Tadakuni received orders and in the third month of this year attacked and killed Yoshiaki. Yoshinori then granted the Ryukyu Kingdom to Tadakuni as a reward. From then on, it became a dependency of the Shimazu clan, with annual tribute never ceasing.

[Marginal note] It is said that the descendants of the Shimazu retainer who killed Yoshiaki at this time still suffer from his curse to this day.

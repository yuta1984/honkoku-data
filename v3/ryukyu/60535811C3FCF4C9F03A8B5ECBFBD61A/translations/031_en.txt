If they did not comply, he would launch a major military expedition against them. Shō Nei was greatly alarmed and reported this to Ming. The Ming emperor did not respond. Shō Nei also feared to respond. Because there was no reply, in the 19th year, Hideyoshi again had Yoshihisa send a letter announcing the conquest of Ming. It stated in summary: "Our country has had over a hundred years of rival provinces competing for supremacy. Since my birth, possessing the divine signs to rule the realm, in less than ten years I have unified the entire domain. Through this, distant foreign lands like the Three Han kingdoms and Ryukyu have opened their barriers and come to pay tribute. Now I desire to conquer the great Ming country, but this is not my own doing—it is Heaven's mandate. As for that country, since they have not yet established diplomatic protocols, I first wished to have their land attacked, but Harada Magoshichirō, using the convenience of merchant vessels, comes and goes frequently and introduced close retainers, saying 'I will quickly go to that country and prepare to explain the purpose of our country's naval expedition.' However, deciding victory at a thousand ri without leaving one's command tent is an ancient sage's supreme wisdom. Therefore, I will not yet command generals and soldiers, but will establish a base in Kyushu Hizen next spring. Without delay, they should lower their banners and come submit. If they crawl on their knees and delay, swift conquest will certainly follow. Do not regret this." Shō Nei was again greatly alarmed and reported to Ming. At that time, a man from Ming's Jiangxi named Xu Yijun was in Satsuma and also communicated with Fujian by letter. In Bunroku 2, an envoy visited the capital. In Keichō 14, prior to this, since Ryukyu had belonged to the Shimazu clan from the Kakitsu era and had been paying annual tribute, the Sanshikan official Jana discussed with Ming and persuaded the king to cease tribute and diplomatic missions in recent years. Though Shimazu Iehisa repeatedly admonished and censured them, they rudely refused to comply. Iehisa became angry and, obtaining permission from Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, in the third month of this year, appointed Kabayama Hisataka and others as generals, dispatched 3,000 troops and several dozen warships for conquest. First passing through Ōshima, they attacked Tokuno Island. The garrison forces resisted, 300 were killed, and the remaining forces surrendered. In the fourth month, they took Erabu and Yoron islands and arrived at Naha. Their military might grew ever stronger. Initially, Ryukyu merchants in Satsuma [observed] the military preparations

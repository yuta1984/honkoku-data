Regarding development: in ancient times, when the divine descendants of the heavenly ancestor developed the southwestern islands, Ryukyu was already included within that territory. This can be understood through examination of ancient histories. This is the second piece of evidence. Regarding race: our people differ from the Chinese and other foreign nations in the thickness and beauty of their facial hair, the height of their noses, and the flatness of their cheeks, while the Ryukyuan people's bone structure and appearance are exactly those of our race. This is the third piece of evidence. Regarding language: each sound is pronounced individually without the four tones (level, rising, departing, entering), and their daily conversation actually preserves elements of our ancient language. This is the fourth piece of evidence. Regarding writing: although some high officials use Chinese characters, in民間interactions, they consistently use our national script, and observing their skill in composing waka poetry shows that their nature and emotions are the same as ours. This is the fifth piece of evidence. Regarding political structure: although they establish official titles in imitation of China, names like "pechin" and "oyakata" are all our appellations, and their institutional system also employs our hereditary stipend system. This is the sixth piece of evidence. Regarding protection: whenever disorder occurs in their country, we invariably send money, grain, and troops to assist them, while China remains indifferent to their welfare. This is the seventh piece of evidence. Regarding submission: during Emperor Suiko's reign, the southern sea islands had already submitted to our imperial authority, whereas they did not yield when the Sui attacked them, did not comply when the Mongol Yuan invaded them, and only began following the Chinese calendar during the Ming period. Thus there is a natural sequence in their submission. This is the eighth piece of evidence. Regarding conquest: during the Eiman period, Minamoto no Tametomo took control of it, and during the Keichō period, Shimazu Iehisa subjugated it, while China could only manage to win them over with a single letter of investiture. This is the ninth piece of evidence. Regarding royal lineage: the so-called Shunten was a descendant of our Chinzei Hachirō, and the line has continued unbroken to the present day. This is the most certain of all evidence. Furthermore, heaven

[The rebel] murdered the ruler and usurped the throne. Sonton then attacked the rebels and executed them. The various aji (local lords) then supported him and made him ascend to the throne. This was King Shunten.

The Tenson clan lasted twenty-five generations, from the Year of the Metal Ox in the Taiko era to the Year of the Fire Horse in Bunji 2, approximately 17,802 years before its fall. However, the details of these events are not clear.

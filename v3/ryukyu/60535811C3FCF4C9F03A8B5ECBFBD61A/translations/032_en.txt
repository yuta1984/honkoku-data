and saw [the military preparations], hastily returned and informed the king. Shō Nei was greatly alarmed and had iron chains pre-installed at the harbor entrances of Naha and other ports, with warships and large cannons arranged in formation. Our forces could not attack, so they turned and landed at Unten Port instead. {{Marginal note: It is incorrect to say that Naha was defeated}} In three days they fought five battles and approached Shuri. Shō Nei begged to surrender, but this was not accepted. In the fifth month, they finally entered the national capital. Shō Nei came out and surrendered, whereupon the princes, ministers, and several dozen others were captured. Plundering was strictly forbidden, the islanders were pacified, and after approximately sixty days of military campaigns, all the Ryukyu islands were completely pacified. {{Marginal note: The so-called "Ryukyu War Tales" circulating in the world are fabrications and should not be trusted}} Garrison troops were then stationed, and in the sixth month, they returned in triumph leading Shō Nei and others.

[Text outside frame at top] At this time, although the entire Ryukyu territory was granted, the Shimazu clan retained the northern islands while the south remained attached to the Ryukyu king. The reason was that the eight northern islands were actually taken by military force, while the south was obtained through surrender. The distinction in legitimacy is naturally proper.

From then on, court visits continued uninterrupted. Shō Nei remained in Satsuma for three years, received pardon, and returned home. In the eighteenth year, Iehisa sent a letter to Shō Nei urging tribute to the shogunate, and with the shogun's intent, had Shō Nei mediate by sending a letter to Ming requesting to open trade routes, threatening that if they did not comply, forces from the western sea route would be dispatched to invade Ming. Shō Nei finally conveyed this message to the Ming military command in Fujian. Shō Nei died, and Shō Ei's nephew Shō Hō and his son Shō Ken succeeded in turn. In Shōhō 1, {{Marginal note: later Kōmyō}} the Qing captured Yanjing (Beijing), and Ming relocated to Jiangnan. In the third year, Shō Ken then sent envoys to Qing. Thereafter, diplomatic missions and tribute to Qing continued uninterrupted, as in Ming times. His brother Shō Shitsu succeeded. In Keian 2, Ming's Prince Lu was in Zhoushan and sent a letter to Shō Shitsu seeking to renew their alliance, and also entrusted a letter

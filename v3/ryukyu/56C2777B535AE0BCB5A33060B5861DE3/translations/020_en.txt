guard it. After a while, that girl appeared and came pursuing him. She questioned the three
monks, but they all acted as if they knew nothing and tried to tease her and send her
away. The girl could not find Matsuju and cried and screamed like a madwoman, still trying
to search for his whereabouts as she rushed outside the gate. The monks now felt relieved and tried to move that
bell away. The sound echoed in the mountain, so the woman quickly ran
back, her hair disheveled and her countenance changed, saying "My beloved must be
inside this bell," and entered the bell. The head priest was alarmed and together with the other monks
surrounded the bell and prayed over it. Perhaps through the efficacy of their religious practice, the bell rose by itself
to the bell tower, and the woman manifested the form of a female demon and struck it with a bell mallet.
The monks did not flinch in the slightest but remained motionless and continued praying, when suddenly the sky
became overcast and earthquakes and lightning occurred tremendously. The woman became a demon
as she was and grabbed Matsuju and ran away. This too is one act of kyōgen.
These two stories are both old tales that occurred in the Ryukyu Kingdom about a hundred years
ago. Besides these, they perform Chinese songs, dances, and theatrical plays.
They also transmit Japanese sarugaku and perform
mai-bayashi and such. They greatly favor gidayū-bushi and well memorize
the musical passages of pieces like "Ashikari" and recite them.

○Calligraphy

【Left page】
For calligraphy, they use the Japanese Ōhashi and Tamaoki schools. Katakana and hiragana
are commonly used throughout the country by all classes of people. Correspondence
to Satsuma domain is all written vertically using the "Ippitsu keijō" epistolary style.
When writing, they do not lean on a desk but hold the paper in the left hand and write with suspended wrist,
the same as in Japan.

○Religious Sects
The monks of this country are not permitted to enter Tang China to transmit the Buddhist teachings, but
come to Satsuma to study the teachings. They wear robes of reddish-brown color. In addition to the kesa,
they wear one garment whose design is like a vest, called "danzoku." Their hats
are like Chinese bamboo hats, made of felt. The religious sects are
only Rinzai Zen and Shingon, as recorded in the "Chūzan Denshinroku."

○Cultivation
Rice fields are plowed and seeded between September and October, and around October and November, when
green seedlings emerge from the water, they watch for good weather to transplant them to the main fields.
This season coincides with the heavy rains, when thunder sounds and earthworms sing, and the climate
is exactly like spring. From then until the following year, they weed in spring and in summer (May)
harvest the crop. 《Immediately after, they sow wheat in the same fields and harvest it within the year.》 When June comes, great winds frequently
arise and sudden showers fall violently, causing all fruits to fall, so the harvest must be completed quickly.

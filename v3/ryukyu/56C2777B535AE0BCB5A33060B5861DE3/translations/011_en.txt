○The king wears a black gauze cap with red cords, dragon-head hairpins, and robes with cloud-dragon patterns, using a rhinoceros horn and white jade sash. All are made in Ming Dynasty style. Though now receiving investiture from the Qing Dynasty, the cap and robe styles have not been changed from ancient times. Below first rank, there are eight grades of caps, four grades of hairpins, and four grades of sashes. The general outline is as follows:
First rank uses gold hairpins, caps of colored brocade, brocade sashes, and wears green robes (envoys coming to Edo are first rank, but as the king's representatives, they wear the king's ceremonial dress). Second rank uses gold hairpins (subordinate second rank has heads made of gold, with silver shafts), purple silk caps, beautiful sashes with coiled dragon patterns (those with merit wear brocade sashes), and wears deep blue robes. Third rank uses silver hairpins, yellow silk caps, with sashes and robes the same as second rank. Fourth rank has red sashes woven with coiled dragon patterns, with hairpins, caps, and robes the same as third rank. Fifth rank has colored thread flower-patterned sashes, with everything else the same as third rank. Sixth and seventh ranks have yellow silk caps, with hairpins and robes the same as third rank, and sashes the same as fifth rank. Eighth and ninth ranks have fire-red silk gauze caps, with everything else the same as seventh rank. Minor officials have red silk caps, with everything else the same as seventh rank. Those wearing copper hairpins and red cloth caps, or green cloth caps, are village heads and community leaders. Those wearing blue cloth caps are peasant headmen. All official robes are longer than everyday clothing and are fastened with sashes from above. They are worn quite loosely, and paper cases, tobacco pouches, etc. are kept in the bosom as in Japan. Children's clothing has side openings of about 3-4 sun, which are sewn closed at coming-of-age. Coming-of-age

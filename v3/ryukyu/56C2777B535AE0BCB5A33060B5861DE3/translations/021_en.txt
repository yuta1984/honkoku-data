must be done. Because of the frequent wind damage, throughout this country they plow in autumn, sow seeds in winter,
weed in spring, and harvest in summer. From June to September, they do not engage in agriculture.
Farm tools are mostly of Japanese manufacture. Particularly for spades and hoes,
those made in Ryukyu have dull iron that cannot withstand use. The high fields collect
rainwater, while the low fields gradually slope downward, drawing spring water to flow down for irrigation. Inlets and small rivers
all have salt water entering them, making it difficult to use them as irrigation water for rice fields.

○Folding Screens 《Appendix》 Iroha
The folding screens used in this country have four panels. At the top, four characters such as "bun-gyō-chū-shin" (literary accomplishment, conduct, loyalty, trustworthiness) or
"spring-summer-autumn-winter" are written in large characters, one character each. Below that,
poetry unrelated to the large characters above is written in two lines.
Additionally, the iroha syllabary commonly used by all classes throughout the country is said to have begun during the time of King Shunten, son of Tametomo.
When people of this country read Chinese texts, they
apply kunten (reading marks) just like in Japan. These two points were
omitted above, so I record them here.

of tribute to our court has been not infrequent. Therefore,
although there are several books that describe in advance
the customs and conditions of that country, those with flowery language

I am filled with joy to know that His Excellency the Dainagon continues in excellent health and spirits. Regarding the matter of sending an envoy to offer congratulations on the occasion of the change of shōgun, I made a request through the Lord of Satsuma, and as instructed, I shall proceed according to previous precedent. As congratulatory gifts, I am now sending Prince Gushikawa. Along with this, I respectfully present one tachi sword, one horse, and other items as listed in the accompanying catalog. I humbly request your favorable consideration of these matters. With utmost reverence and humility.

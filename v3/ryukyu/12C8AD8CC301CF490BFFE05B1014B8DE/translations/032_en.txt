The aforementioned correspondence, one sheet, was rolled up tightly,
so it was wrapped in quarter-corner paper, and the format of the ceremonial paper
is as follows:
┌ No superscription
┌──────────────────┐
│　　　　【Six-corner knot present】　　　　　│
└──────────────────┘

This paper is folded in two and wrapped, so it does not appear to be formal correspondence paper
┌──────────────────┐
│Respectfully submitted　Lord Nishio Okinokami　　　King of Chuzan　　│

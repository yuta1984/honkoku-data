1. In the second room of the Great Hall (Ōhiroma), the rōjū (senior councilors) and wakadoshiyori (junior councilors) positioned themselves near the sliding screens on the north side and were seated in order toward the east. At this time, Satsuma-no-kami had already taken his seat on the south side of that section. Afterwards, two ōmetsuke guided Prince Gushikawa from the palace reception hall to be seated facing west near the threshold of the third room of the Great Hall. He bowed once to the rōjū, who acknowledged with a slight bow in return. When Prince Gushikawa moved to sit within the threshold area, Satsuma-no-kami accompanied him and proceeded to the center of the second room.

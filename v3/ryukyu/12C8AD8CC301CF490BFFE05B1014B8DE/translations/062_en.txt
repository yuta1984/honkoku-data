When Gushikawa takes his seat within the threshold area, he proceeds to the center of the Ni-no-ma following Satsuma-no-kami.
At this time, there is a shogunal command stating that white silver and cotton are to be bestowed upon the King of Chūzan, as the shōgun is pleased that [the king] sent an envoy from such a distant land on the occasion of the succession. The senior councilors convey this message, and Satsuma-no-kami and Gushikawa perform one bow.
　　White silver: 500 pieces for the King of Chūzan
　　Cotton: 500 bundles
These bestowed items have been in the Ōhiroma since earlier...

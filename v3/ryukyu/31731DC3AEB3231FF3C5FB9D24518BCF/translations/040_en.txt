《annotation: Naha children only receive stipends when they serve up to the rank of kurakan [treasury official]. Below this rank, none receive stipends》
　The above are the numbers of stipends and salaries for the Tang camp officials of Kume village
Officials from jimoku-kan down, both high and low ranking, who have merit transmit hereditary stipends and fiefs to their descendants,
all with differences made according to merit

　Farmland
All farmland is plowed and planted in the ninth and tenth months, with harvest completed in the fifth month. Each official personally visits the fief
land granted to them to oversee plowing and harvesting. Officials or their children supervise this. In the tenth and
eleventh months, green seedlings all emerge from the water, and seedlings are transplanted and planted separately. When heavy rains come, thunder rumbles and
earthworms sing, and the climate is like spring. North winds blow intermittently but are not severely cold. In late
eleventh month, one kajasha [inspector] is dispatched, and two sattaiki-kan [surveillance officials] tour the villages separately to encourage agriculture. After more than one month
they return. In the sixth month, great hurricanes frequently occur, sea rains fly horizontally and all fruits fall. This happens
every year as a regular occurrence. If harvest is not completed early, there will surely be much suffering from uprooted rice. Therefore, that country practices autumn plowing, winter
planting, spring weeding, and summer harvesting. This serves both to take advantage of rain and moisture and to avoid typhoon damage. The year-round warmth
makes two crops reasonable, but after the sixth month all fields lie fallow with no work done for this reason

　Calendar
For calendars they follow the imperial calendar, and when tribute envoys reach the capital they must wait for the distribution of calendars on the first day of the tenth month to bring them back. When they reach the country
more than half a year has already passed, so the people of the country establish a shirekiryō-tsūji-kan [calendar administration interpreter official] with official rank of seventh grade to make advance calculations
and apply the calendar. Written on the calendar face it says "The calendar official of Ryukyu Kingdom respectfully follows the imperial command and hereby creates and selects"

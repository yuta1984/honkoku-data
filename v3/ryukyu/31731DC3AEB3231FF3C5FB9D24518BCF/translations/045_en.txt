In the central bay of the Buddha hall, Buddha is enshrined, and the left and right sides are like side chambers storing the spirit tablets of former kings who have already been removed to the distant shrine. The right corridor in front of the Buddha hall serves as a spirit hall, with two halls arranged side by side. Each hall has three bays and all face south. The upper hall has three niches: the central one is for Shō En Ryū Keiungun, which is his posthumous name. This is the founding ancestor of the kingdom. The left niche is for Shō Shitsu, the great-great-grandfather of the current king, and the right niche is for Shō Tei, the great-grandfather of the current king. The lower hall also has three niches: Shō Shin was the son of Shō En and is considered the Grand Ancestor of the kingdom. Both he and the founding ancestor Shō En are perpetual tablets that are never removed, so they both occupy the central niche. The left niche is for Shō Eki, the father of the current king, and the right niche is for Shō Jun, the grandfather of the current king. The reason the father is placed on the left and the grandfather on the right is that the positions of alternating generations (shōboku) are fixed, and there is no concern about equal veneration.

Inside Tennō Temple there are also spirit tablets. The Buddha hall faces south and has three bays: Buddha is enshrined in the center, and in the left bay there are two spirit tablets. One is inscribed "Spirit Tablet of Kijin Shō Shoku," who was the father of founding ancestor Shō En. The other is inscribed "Spirit Tablet of Kijin Shō Kyū," and Shō Kyū was the father of King Shō Hō and the third son of Shō Gen. Both were fathers of kings but never became kings themselves, so they are separately enshrined here. The two tablets beside them are for queen consorts. The four tablets in the right bay are all for queen consorts.

Inside Tenkai Temple is the spirit tablet of Shō I, who was the father of King Shō Nei. The temple is entirely for female spirits, enshrining queen consorts and royal sisters who married and have family shrines may also be interred here. When Crown Prince Shō Eki died, after the initial burial, his spirit tablet was placed in the Crown Prince's residence, where male and female officials in mourning dress performed daily mourning rituals. After one hundred days, the tablet was moved to Tenkai Temple, where men and women also daily burned incense and silk offerings. After the three-year mourning period ended and the tablet was permanently installed, palace women could no longer participate in the ritual ceremonies. The rites for all previous kings followed this same pattern.

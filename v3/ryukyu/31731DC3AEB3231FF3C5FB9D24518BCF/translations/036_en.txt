　　Personnel Selection
　Among the people of the country, those who enter government service are only from the four villages of Shuri, Tomari, Naha, and Kume. All others are
　farmers. Among these, those who have some understanding of the national script become chieftains called "sadame"《Annotation: local name Yama-
　hagui》who receive documents and orders to
　mobilize villagers for corvée labor. Next are the head guards called "sakujimono"《Annotation: local name Yama-
　hirakiko》who all
　serve in subordinate roles, wear blue-green caps, and serve for life without promotion.
　The people of the three villages of Shuri, Tomari, and Naha are called "jin'ya." Sons of officials who have not yet entered service are called "shi."
　"Shi" shave their heads, and when promoted to chikutōshi become tōshirō. Next they are named chikutōshi-za and become
　tōshi-sarō. There are also those named "ōhitsuja," "fukuhitsuja," and "ōkan-hitsuja," which are like China's
　hitsuteishiki. There are also those named "wakahitsuja," which are like China's kanshō, assisting the great [officials] of villages and counties.

Now, having obtained the general outline of the ranking system from Minister Cai Wen, Minister Cheng Shunze presented the official system, and according to his memorial: "The establishment of offices and division of duties in Chūzan is not a matter of just one day. Respectfully encountering the extensive spread of the Sacred Emperor's teachings, our country's official ranks dare not fail to reverently follow them. Therefore, we have reformed according to the original titles, first establishing the order of ranks and merits, then arranging the hierarchy of official positions large and small. All ministers and officials are entirely based on qualifications, with caps, hairpins, and clothing colors standardized and unchangeable. In terms of names, they are the same yet differ in rank; in terms of grades, they differ yet are the same, all conforming to the old system and harmonizing with proper pronunciation. The ranking system truly honors the king." His document lists tables and analyzes items systematically, presenting an admirable sight. However, while the founding of the nation and establishment of offices equally emphasizes both civil and military aspects, examining the military positions outside the Ceremonial Guard and Military Preparation Office reveals they are too abbreviated, and military systems and weaponry are also not recorded in detail. This should await future supplementary investigations and compilations.

片帽 (One-sided cap)
　The one-sided caps are all made of black silk, covering the top of the head with a brim below forming a hexagonal shape. These are worn at home during cold weather by medical officials, musicians, and those who serve tea in the royal palace and have shaved heads like monks.

Kasa (Conical hat)
　Most kasa are made from wheat stalks, though there are also leather kasa with black lacquer applied to the outside and vermillion on the inside.

Short hairpin
　Short hairpins for small topknots are about three to four sun in length. They are worn by those who already wear caps and have removed the hair from the top of their heads. The decorative heads are cylindrical, though there are also square and hexagonal columns. Gold is most precious, followed by gold heads with silver shafts, then silver, with copper being the lowest grade.

Long hairpin
　Long hairpins are over one shaku in length, worn by women and children who arrange their hair in large topknots. These are also classified into three grades of gold and silver to distinguish social status. The hairpins of women from common households are all made of tortoiseshell.

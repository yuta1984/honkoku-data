　Previous Royal Consorts
　　The sequence in the preface to the former map in Wang Ji's "Chronicle of Chuzan" from the previous mission was somewhat disordered, so it has now been corrected.
　　All kings are called "spirit tablets" (shinshu), but only the four rulers Nei, Hō, Ken, and Shitsu are called "honored spirits" (sonrei), and their
　　courtesy names are also added: Nei is called Kōō, Hō is called Sōsei, Ken is called Shūei, and Shitsu is called Chokukō.

[Sacred Temple] Spring and Autumn Sacrifices: In the first month of the 58th year of Kangxi, Purple-Gold Official Tei Junsoku petitioned to use the great sacrifice (tairo) for sacrifices to Confucius and the lesser sacrifice (shōrō) for sacrifices to Duke Qisheng. The numbers of ritual vessels (shaku), silk (haku), grain offerings (shisei), and ritual food containers (henzu) are specifically illustrated in diagrams. For those sacrificial items not available in this country, local products are used as substitutes. Three days before the sacrifice, all participants observe ritual purification and fasting. One day before, they rehearse the ceremony and inspect the sacrificial animals. On the appointed day, the king dispatches a Purple-Gold Official to sacrifice at the Qisheng Shrine at the hour of the Ox (1-3 AM) and sends a Legal Department official to sacrifice at the Sacred Temple at the hour of the Tiger (3-5 AM). All perform the ritual of three kneelings and nine kowtows, drinking blessed wine, and receiving sacrificial meat. This ceremony was first performed in the second month of that year. Previously, Purple-Gold Officials or Chief Historian officials served as chief celebrants, performing eight prostrations without the drinking of blessed wine or receiving sacrificial meat, only burning paper money without using silk, and without purification or animal inspection rites, which seemed too simple, so the current proper ceremony was petitioned for.

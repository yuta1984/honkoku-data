The Double Ninth Festival Banquet

Dragon Pond is located north of the royal palace, to the west of Engaku-ji Temple. It is less than half a ri in length and covers several dozen mu in area. The water is clear and flows quietly, connecting with the lotus pond in front of Engaku-ji Temple. This is where the downstream waters of Zuisen converge. The southern bank is called Sacred Peak, densely covered with banana trees so thick that neither sun nor moon can be seen through them. They cast their reflection over the blue pond. There is no spare space along the shore. On the long embankment of the northern bank, oyster shell walls connect to the ramparts, all inhabited by great clans. A small bridge spans east to west, with waterways flowing into the fields. The eastern shore has a pointed wharf jutting out into the middle of the pond. Flowering trees stand like a forest, with three sides facing the water. For the Double Ninth Festival banquet, dragon boat races are held, with seating arranged on top of this wharf.

First, a wooden pavilion is erected on the wharf, decorated with colorful streamers in multiple layers, with felt mats spread around all four sides. The king invites the guests and seating is arranged. There are three dragon boats. Their style is roughly the same as those seen in Fuzhou. The boats are over three zhang in length, with twenty-eight oars

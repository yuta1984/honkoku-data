The farewell banquet serves as the fifth banquet. The ceremonies are as before. Additionally, one or two historical tales from the country are added as entertainment.

The departure audience banquet serves as the sixth banquet. The ceremonies increase the theatrical entertainment as before. When the banquet ends, the king escorts the guests out of the palace. Upon reaching outside Shureimon Gate, a small reception is further arranged in the Crown Prince's residence. The king personally offers three cups of sake as farewell.

The ship-viewing banquet serves as the seventh banquet. The king comes to the Imperial Envoy's lodge to hold a banquet. The ceremonies are as in previous rites. He directly presents a handful of golden fans as farewell gifts. When the banquets and ceremonies for us officials are completed, we select an auspicious day to board the investiture ship and await favorable winds. We return to court to report on our mission. King Shō Kei of Chūzan dispatches attending officials including the Chief Justice, Royal Uncle, and Purple-Gold Rank officials, carrying a memorial to express gratitude for the imperial grace. Along with tribute goods, they attach themselves to the regular annual tribute ship and depart together with the investiture ship.

They wait. The proclamation-reading official reads through to completion in a composed manner. The interpreter official calls out "Burn the silk." The great-great-grandson leads the assembled officials, all rising, and proceeds to the silk-burning site to wait. After the burning is completed, they return to the open terrace, and together with the assembled officials give thanks, performing three kneelings and nine kowtows. When the ceremony ends, they withdraw from formation. The great-great-grandson carries the spirit tablet of Former King Shō Tei, enters the temple through the gate on the eastern side of the temple, and places it on the spirit seat on the eastern side. The great-great-grandson again carries the spirit tablet of Former King Shō Eki and places it in position. The Imperial Envoy again takes the text "Imperial Sacrifice to Former King Shō Eki" and presents it to the scroll-bearing official. This follows the previous ceremony.

The two imperial sacrificial texts are both separately transcribed. The original imperial edict on yellow paper is all requested to be kept and offered in the temple.

When the imperial sacrificial ceremony concludes, the Imperial Envoy changes clothes. The great-great-grandson bows and proceeds to the eastern hall to perform the ceremony of formal meeting. 《Marginal note: Until the great-great-grandson receives investiture, he still maintains the curtained quarters. Only at this point does he first meet with the imperial envoys. The seven banquets begin from here. Zhang Xueli's record states that upon first arrival there was a "welcome wind banquet," but this is incorrect.》 The Imperial Envoy sits in the east, the great-great-grandson sits in the west. Each performs three bows, seats are arranged, and tea is served. After completion, they request to proceed to the front hall for a banquet. The Imperial Envoy goes left, the great-great-grandson goes right, and they arrive at the front hall. The Imperial Envoy sits in the east, the great-great-grandson sits peacefully in the west. The chief envoy sits in the east, the deputy envoy sits in the west, both facing south. The great-great-grandson sits facing northeast. No music is arranged. Tea and wine are all personally offered. The Imperial Envoy declines. The Imperial Envoy's reciprocal offering is also declined. When the banquet ends, they request the Imperial Envoy to travel by palanquin to Tekisui-mae. The great-great-grandson descends the steps, bows, and takes leave. The assembled officials exit the gate and kneel in farewell.

The great-great-grandson, unable to visit the envoys' quarters to give thanks on this day, first sends an official to the quarters to express gratitude for their labor. The Imperial Envoy also sends an official the next day to enter the royal castle to give thanks for the banquet. This is designated as the First Banquet.

the fan dance (performed by six children), one is the rhythm-keeping dance (performed by three children), one is the hat dance (performed by four children), and one is the flower basket dance (performed by three children). All of the above are called "Songs of Great Peace."

The second act concerns the ancient story of two children, Tsuru and Kame, who avenged their father. The aji (lord) of Nakagusuku, Mō Kokutei, was loyal and brave, serving his country faithfully. At that time, the aji of Katsuren, Akō, became a military commander at a young age, but grew arrogant and harbored treasonous thoughts. He despised Nakagusuku and slandered him to the king, falsely accusing him of rebellion. The king ordered Akō to lead troops to exterminate Mō Kokutei's entire clan. Lord Mō committed suicide. His two sons - one named Tsuru, aged thirteen, and the other named Kame, exactly twelve years old - were already showing exceptional talent. Their father had regularly taught them swordsmanship with two precious swords. At the time, they were staying with their mother at their maternal grandfather's house in Sannan, at Saga Kuniyoshi's residence. Upon hearing of the tragedy, they wept and begged their mother to let them find an opportunity to kill Akō and avenge their father. They obtained the precious swords, each wearing one, and walked to Katsuren. They waited for Akō's spring outing, concealed their swords, and approached him. Akō was pleased and drunk. He removed his clothing and belt, giving them to the two children, and also gave one of his swords to Tsuru. Tsuru took advantage of his drunkenness, drew the sword and stabbed him, crying out loudly: "I am the son of Lord Mō. Now I kill you to avenge my father." Akō started up in alarm, but his head fell with the sword. All his retinue were drunk and were reportedly killed by the two children.

The third act concerns the bell demon. In Koba village of Nakagusuku County, there was a farming family surnamed Tō who had a son named Matsuju. He was fifteen years old, fair-skinned and handsome. He went to Shuri to study under a teacher. One day, traveling to Urasoe, he was walking along a mountain path toward dusk, using a bamboo pole to feel his way along the ground. Seeing a light, he sought lodging at what turned out to be a hunter's house. The father had gone out for night hunting, leaving only a sixteen-year-old daughter who was quite bewitching and beautiful. She invited him to stay the night and tried to seduce him. Matsuju sat down intending to sleep and refused her advances. She forcibly tried to embrace him. Matsuju brushed away his clothes and stood up. The woman felt ashamed and angry, took hunting implements to kill Matsuju. Matsuju fled and the woman pursued him. Around a bend in the mountain was Manju Temple, where the head priest Monk Futoku

Reverently serving Heaven and inheriting the Mandate

The Emperor's edict states: I humbly receive Heaven's favor and govern all nations. My teachings and commands are widely promulgated, bringing both far and near under submission. Even those in the remote frontier territories all receive benevolent grace.

Successive generations have maintained ancestral sacrifices, and all receive imperial favor. Your Ryukyu Kingdom is located in the southern borderlands and holds rank among the feudal territories.

The heir-grandson of the Chuzan King, Sho Kei, has repeatedly sent envoys to pay court and has been unfailing in tribute. When the Fujian borders were in rebellion and pirates rampaged on land and sea, he steadfastly maintained his loyalty as a vassal, his respectful obedience became ever more evident, and he fully demonstrated his faithful sincerity.

This is deeply commendable. Now, in proper succession, the time has come for him to inherit the throne, and he has petitioned for investiture. I consider that hereditary succession is the constant principle of family and state, and the conferment of noble rank is a great ceremony of the court. I specially dispatch Chief Envoy Hai Bao of the Hanlin Academy and Vice Envoy Xu Baoguang, Compiler of the Hanlin Academy, bearing this edict to go and invest him as King of Chuzan of the Ryukyu Kingdom. Let the ministers and officials of your kingdom, as well as the scholars and common people, assist your king, carefully cultivate virtuous government, increasingly strengthen sincere devotion, support the imperial house, and extend the prosperity of your ancestral line. This is truly the boundless blessing of your maritime realm. Therefore I issue this edict to make it known to all.

Imperial Edict Bestowed
The Emperor issues an edict to the heir-grandson of the Chuzan King of Ryukyu Kingdom, Sho Kei. I consider that you dwell far away in a corner of the sea yet devoutly fulfill your tributary obligations. As the eldest heir, you should rightfully inherit the throne. Because you have not yet received the court's mandate, you dare not act presumptuously on your own authority but respectfully follow established protocols, presenting a memorial to request investiture. I am mindful that your family has maintained loyalty as vassals for generations, and your faithfulness is

The Ancestral Temple of the Former Kings of Chuzan

It is about two li from the Imperial Envoy's Guesthouse to the Former Kings' Temple. To the east of the guesthouse is the Tianfei Temple. In front of the temple is a square pond. After crossing the pond and traveling northeast along the embankment for less than half a li, there is Izumizaki Bridge. Beside the bridge is the Confucian temple. Walking several hundred paces east from the temple and turning north, one reaches the Chōkō Embankment. The embankment extends for about two li. Seven water gates are constructed below to allow the tide to flow through. {{Note: Beside the embankment is a small rocky hill called Shichiseisan (Seven Star Mountain). Seven stones stand separately in the sandy fields.}}

Where the embankment ends, turning north, there is Asato Bridge. {{Note: This place is called Asato, hence the name. Wang's record incorrectly writes it as Shingyoku Bridge. There is a separate Shingyoku Bridge located north of Tomigusuku, above Gyokuchō.}} After crossing the bridge and turning east, there is the Chuzan Former Kings' Temple. In front of the temple are pine-covered hills in several layers, with flowing streams on the left and right. The width is about one jō, flowing in a circle and entering the sea below Asato Bridge. The stone path in front of the temple is square and wide. Wooden memorial arches and dismounting stone monuments are erected on the left and right, one each. The temple walls on all four sides are all made of dressed stone...

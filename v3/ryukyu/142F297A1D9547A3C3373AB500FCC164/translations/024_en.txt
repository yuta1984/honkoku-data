[The king] receives the imperial edict at the base of this gate. The stone walls on both sides of the road gradually become higher, reaching eight to nine shaku. To the left of the road outside the gate is Tenkai Temple. The temple gate faces north, and the Buddha hall faces west. The southwest area in front of the temple serves as the royal cemetery. Within the enclosure across the street is the Daimi Hall. Proceeding further about half a ri leads to Kankai Gate, which is the castle town of the Chūzan King. Located on a mountaintop, it has castle walls of whetstone extending three to four ri in circumference. Viewed from afar, it appears like a collection of skulls. This has been recorded since ancient times, presumably referring to its resemblance in shape. The mountain's form and palace layout originally face north-south. Since the route from Naha to Chūzan ascends from the western hill, all gates face west. On the stone cliffs outside the castle, "Dragon Hill" is carved on the left and "Tiger Peak" on the right. Each of the four sides of the castle has one gate. 《The front Kankai Gate faces west, the rear Keise Gate faces east, the left Water Gate faces south, and the right Kyūkei Gate faces north.》 Proceeding further to Kankai Gate and reaching the base of the stone cliff, there is Zuisen (Auspicious Spring). Ascending the cliff, the gate faces northwest with a plaque reading "Zuisen." 《Both left and right are covered walkways with left and right auxiliary gates that lead into the royal palace.》 Proceeding further, there is a tower with a plaque reading "Water Clock," facing west. Proceeding further leads to Kōfuku Gate, facing northwest. Proceeding further leads to Hōshin Gate, with three gates standing side by side facing west. The royal hall has nine bays, all facing west. Above the palace tower hangs a large plaque with four characters from the imperial calligraphy: "Chūzan Hereditary Lord." This is the royal palace. The courtyard of the front hall is square and covers several dozen mu. The left structure is called Nanrō (South Tower) facing north, and the right is called Hokukyū (North Palace) facing south. A plaque reads "Loyalty and Obedience Are Praiseworthy." All banquets for imperial envoys are held here. All palace buildings are solid and plain. There are many column foundations, with twenty pillars installed for each bay of the building. There are no ornate decorations, nor are they excessively tall and imposing, because they are located on a mountaintop with frequent sea winds.

We received instructions to conduct memorial ceremonies for (my) great-grandfather, Ryukyu Kingdom Chuzan King Sho Tei, and furthermore received instructions to conduct ceremonies for (my) father, Ryukyu Kingdom King Sho Eki. Subsequently, on the twenty-sixth day of the seventh month, the imperial edict was proclaimed, and (I) Kei was invested as Chuzan King. I had the honor of receiving imperial gifts including python robes and other items, and my queen consort was also granted colorful robes and other goods. This is truly the special grace of the Celestial Court and the eternal glory of (my) Kei.

I humbly reflect that His Imperial Majesty's benevolence covers all without exception, extending his grace to this weak and small domain. The envoys braved wind and waves, facing hardships and perils beyond measure.

Since the envoys entered our kingdom, they have pacified and comforted this maritime domain and restrained military duties. All subjects and people throughout the kingdom feel nothing but gratitude and reverence. What (I) Kei deeply regret is that (my) kingdom lies in a remote maritime wilderness, lacking adequate means to show proper respect. Therefore, during banquets and receptions, we substituted goods with gold. Although we knew this to be meager, it was indeed done following established precedent.

The envoys honored us by repeatedly declining, going back and forth several times, firmly upholding righteousness, and resolutely refusing to accept. For the envoys, being cautiously respectful and maintaining their principles was truly admirable, not bringing shame to the dignity of the Sacred Dynasty's diplomatic mission. However, considering that the envoys endured hardships and fatigue, traveling far across ten thousand li of stormy seas, truly for the sake of this humble subject, we wished to express our respect through gifts. Without proper protocol and ceremony, my heart finds it difficult to be at peace.

When the time came for their departure, we again planned multiple farewell banquets and specially dispatched officials including the Chief Justice and Grand Historian to escort and earnestly request acceptance of the gifts. The envoys again sent them back with refusal. Their pure and incorruptible conduct can be said to be consistent from beginning to end. Only this humble subject, in trying to reciprocate kindness and repay merit, could not demonstrate even one ten-thousandth of what was due. I am particularly ashamed that there were deficiencies in the old protocols and that my sincere intentions could not be expressed.

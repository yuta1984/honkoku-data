Mid-Autumn Banquet

In the courtyard of the royal palace, in front of the Hokukyu Dripping Water [pavilion], a wooden platform measuring five to six zhang square was constructed. Curtains and canopies surrounded it on all four sides. The king invited guests to enter and take their seats. First, divine songs of blessing and praise were presented. The explanatory text states: At the beginning of our country's primordial chaos, the first to emerge and rule the world was called the Tenson-shi (Heavenly Grandson Clan). Like China's Emperor Fuxi, they governed through tranquil simplicity. Successors became national rulers and ascended to the throne. The gods would always appear and show their divine protection. Thus, welcoming songs for the gods were composed to celebrate and rejoice. Later, the gods no longer appeared frequently. The remnant melodies of the divine songs still exist today. Every time a king ascends the throne, and when conducting various celebratory affairs, these are invariably performed. When former kings received investiture and subsequently banqueted the heavenly envoys, it was customary to perform these first. An old man would be brought forth to mount the stage without making music, only chanting divine songs, bowing and offering prayers.

the imperial edict. Regarding the banquet gold offered by this Ryukyu Kingdom, the envoys shall still be ordered to accept it. This imperial command is recorded and filed. Although the current king Sho Kei now claims to respectfully present banquet gold with detailed records, carried by accompanying ministers for presentation, earnestly requesting an imperial decree granting acceptance, Hai Bao and Xu Baoguang, looking up to and embodying His Majesty's special consideration and utmost intentions, have not yet accepted. There should be no need to deliberate on what the kingdom's king requests regarding acceptance. On the first day of the ninth month, receiving the imperial edict: the banquet gold shall still be accepted by the envoys according to old precedents.

This subject Baoguang notes: The practice of Ming dynasty envoys declining gold began with Chen Kan. Emperor Shizong still ordered Kan and others to accept it. Subsequently, it became customary to decline, and there were also cases where the decline was approved and tribute envoys were ordered to take the gifts back. In our dynasty's Kangxi 2nd year (guimao), 22nd year (jihai), and the current third mission, all have received imperial grace and were ordered to accept. The means of encouraging envoys has reached its utmost. During the jihai mission, the Ryukyu king memorialized citing the old precedent of Zhang Xueli's prostrate return to his original position, and on behalf of Wang Ji and Lin Linfen, submitted a request to deliberate on promotions and honors. At that time, although maritime troubles had been pacified, maritime prohibitions were still strict and the mission was arduous and dangerous, making deliberation on honors appropriate. Now, however, peace has lasted long, the realm is unified as one family, and moreover the sea spirits comply obediently, making treading dangerous paths as easy as level ground. Such routine comings and goings are the normal duty of subjects - what hardship can be spoken of? To seek honors with empty words - I truly dare not follow this as precedent.

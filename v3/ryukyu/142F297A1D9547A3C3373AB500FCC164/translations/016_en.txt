On the second day after arriving at the guesthouse, they first visit the Confucian temple to offer incense, then proceed to the Tianfei Temple. During the winter solstice, a Ten Thousand Years Dragon Pavilion is set up in the Minglun Hall to the left of the temple. After the envoys perform the ceremonies in order, they also pay respects to the statue of the Master (Confucius). This is not done on the first and fifteenth days of the month.

The Tianzun Temple enshrines Leisheng Puhua Tianzun (Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Celestial Worthy).

Therefore, on the second day they also go to offer incense. On the first and fifteenth days of the month, they do not visit again.

"Omoro Sōshi"
The "Omoro Sōshi" consists of 22 volumes in total, containing 1,554 songs, with 1,143 actual songs excluding duplicates, written in hiragana with occasional Chinese characters. It was compiled in three phases between 1531 and 1623.

and their primitive industry was also rice cultivation, so it was rather natural that their customs and culture were of the same nature. Particularly in medieval times, as exchanges with Japan became increasingly frequent, Omoro strongly reflects the language, material culture, and thought of mainland Japan.

Ancient Omoro: Omoro are ancient songs of Ryukyu, compiled in the 21-volume "Omoro Sōshi." They were sung in both the Okinawa and Ōshima island groups from around the 12th century to the beginning of the 17th century, but for some reason, those from Miyako and Yaeyama are not included.

"Omoro" means "to think," and even today in areas outside Shuri it is called "Umui." "Omoi" (thought) also means "lover." When "omoi" was added above or below common names, it became an honorific title. "Omi" and "Moi" in names like "Omitsuru" (Thinking Crane) and "Tsurumoi" (Crane Thought) are examples of this.

Volume one of "Omoro Sōshi" was compiled in Kyōroku 4 (1531).

The content is entirely that of the Kikoe-ōgimi, with "Aoriyahe-gabushi" comprising the majority. An example of Omoro from volume one, section two, is shown on the left.

　　　　　Aoriyahe-gabushi
　　1. Kikoe-ōgimi-giya,
　　　　orite, asubiyowareba,
　　　　kami-teda-no, mamori-yowaru,
　　　　anji-osoi,
　　　Again, toyomu, sedaka-ko-ga,
　　　Again, Shuri-mori-gusuku,
　　　Again, Madama-mori-gusuku.

　　　　　(Translation) When the Kikoe-ōgimi
　　　　　　　descends (from heaven) and plays,
　　　　　　　the gods and sun protect
　　　　　　　the anji-osoi (king).
　　　　　　Again, resounding, Sedaka-ko
　　　　　　　　　　(repetition follows below)
　　　　　　Again, Shuri-mori castle,
　　　　　　Again, Madama-mori castle.

While the form of this Omoro follows an ancient and common pattern, its content—the Kikoe-ōgimi blessing the king—is not ancient.

The first Kikoe-ōgimi was the sister of King Shō Shin (1477-1526). In other words, the king's onari-god became the Kikoe-ōgimi. The relationship between neko and ne-gami from the Makiyo period continued unchanged, with the prince being neko and the ne-gami being Kikoe-ōgimi.

Ancient Omoro forms include paired words, parallel phrases, and repetitions, preferring to use archaic language. In this Omoro too, kami-teda, kikoe, and toyomu are paired words; Kikoe-ōgimi and toyomu-sedaka-ko, Shuri-mori castle and Madama-mori-gusuku form parallel phrases. The second line and below of verses two, three, and four are abbreviated, but each repeats the second line and below of the first verse.

The meaning of this song is that when the goddess called Kikoe-ōgimi

descends from heaven and performs sacred dances at the ceremonial site within Shuri Castle, the heavenly gods and the sun protect the king.

1. Sedaka-ko: Meaning a person rich in seji (spiritual power), a beautiful name for the Kikoe-ōgimi.

An example of Omoro with ancient content:

　　　　　Kimi-ga-nashi-bushi (Volume 15, No. 15)
　　1. Ezo, Ezo-no-ishi-gusuku,
　　　　Amamikiyo-ga, takudaru, gusuku,
　　　Again, Ezo, Ezo-no-kana-gusuku.

　　　　　(Translation) Izu, Izu's stone castle,
　　　　　　　The castle that Amamikiyo built,
　　　　　　Again, Izu, Izu's metal castle.
　　　　　　　　　　(repetition)

Izu is a settlement in Urasoe village in central Okinawa, where a local strongman built a castle as his base and ruled the surrounding area. A historical figure who emerges clearly from the mists of ancient legend is a person called "Ezo-no-ikusa-moi" (Volume 15, No. 18). What later historical records call King Eiso is a phonetic rendering of "eso" from "Ezo-no-ikusa-moi." This Omoro praises his castle.

1. Amamikiyo: According to legend, a deity who created the Okinawan islands by command of the sun god. Here it is understood as simply praising the castle.

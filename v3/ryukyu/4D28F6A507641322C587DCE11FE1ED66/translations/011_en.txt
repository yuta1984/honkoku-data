However, all four Type A pieces belong to Higa Noro, while the three Type B pieces belong to Gusuku Noro, Une Noro, and Gima Noro respectively, one each. Since these were collected from various locations, the differences come not from chronological issues but from different transmission lineages. When tradition bearers die suddenly and oral traditions perish, or when they make mistakes in transmission and the traditions become increasingly distorted generation by generation, they lose their original form within several generations. The Omoro collected by Tajima Risaburō in 1896 (Meiji 29) also barely retains its ancient original form. Collection has continued since then, but I think it has little utility value.

III. Ryūka (Ryukyu Songs)

It is questionable whether Ryūka (Ryukyu songs) should be included among oral literature. The term "Ryūka" itself was created to distinguish it from Japanese waka poetry and is not ancient. As mentioned earlier, Omoro had no words like "uta" or "utafu," and chanting Omoro or Eto was called "doing Omoro," while Koina was said to be "doing Koina" or "reading Koina." It can be said that the concepts of Omoro and Koina included the element of chanting. In "Ōshima Hikki" (1762), it states: "Ryukyu songs are sung pieces, with accompaniment of koto, sanshin, and kokyū (Chinese fiddle), etc. Only the melodies of these songs have remained unchanged since ancient times, and new songs are composed to fit these melodies." The thirty-odd songs given as examples are so-called Ryukyu songs.

As is well known, Ryūka consists of 30 characters arranged in two verses of 8-8-8 and 8-6 syllables. There is no established theory about its origin, but what can be said clearly is that it lacks the paired words, parallel phrases, and repetitions that were conventional devices of Omoro and common to all oral literature. It also lacks the use of archaic words that had already become difficult for common people to understand by the 16th century. The use of paired words, parallel phrases, repetitions, and archaic language had already become burdensome for ordinary people by the 16th century. It was at this time that Ryūka was created, abandoning these constraints and expressing the people's feelings directly. Even if created unconsciously, it can be said to have been revolutionary literature.

Throughout Omoro and others, 3-5-8 syllables formed the basic number for verses, and this became somewhat fixed especially in Eto-omoro. It happened that in the first half of the 16th century, when songs began to be sung to the accompaniment of the sanshin transmitted from China or the South, general creative desire turned toward Uta, and Omoro merely survived as ritual chanting.

By this period, Japanese literature had already penetrated the ruling class, so the influence of waka poetry appears strongly. However, although common people still lived in an age unconnected to literature, those called masters of song were people of this class, and that tradition

continues even now.

Among Ryukyu songs, many clearly borrow themes, terminology, and seasonal references from Japanese literature. For example, there is a song by Prince Chatan:
"The evergreen pine, unchanging in its nature, always when spring comes, its color grows deeper"

This is clearly an adaptation of a poem from the "Kokin Wakashū":
"The evergreen pine's green too, when spring comes, takes on an even deeper hue"

There are many of this type. They are works by people who studied waka and were familiar with "The Tale of Genji," "Tales of Ise," and other works.

In contrast, the songs of Onna Nabe, a peasant girl, such as:
"Onna Peak over there, where my beloved (sato) was born, push aside even the forest and bring it over here"

are songs anyone can understand. She boldly expresses her true feelings: "Over there beyond Onna Peak is my beloved's village; push aside that mountain and bring that village to this side of the mountain." These fresh Ryūka, born from the old stock of Omoro, use familiar, commonly spoken words while cutting away unnecessary parallel phrases and paired words to create a clean form.

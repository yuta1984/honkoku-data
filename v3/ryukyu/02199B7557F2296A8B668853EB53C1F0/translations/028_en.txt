Twenty-five generations of the Tenson Dynasty ──────────────────【To King Eiso】

During the Shunxi era of the Song Dynasty, Riyu, a retainer of Tokuhi (a descendant of the twenty-fifth generation of the Tenson Dynasty), monopolized power and usurped the throne. Therefore, Urasoe Aji Sonton raised a righteous army and defeated Riyu. The people of the country supported Sonton and placed him on the throne. This was called King Shunten.

○King Shunten────Shunbajunki────King Gihon

His surname was Minamoto, his given name was Sonton. His father was Chinzei Hachiro Tametomo-ko, and his mother was the younger sister of Osato Aji. He was born in the second year of Qiandao of the Song Dynasty, the year of Hinoe-Inu (Qiandao 2nd year corresponds to the first year of Jin'an under Emperor Rokujoin). He ascended the throne in the 14th year of Chunxi, the year of Hinoto-Hitsuji, and died in the first year of Jiaxi, the year of Hinoto-Tori. He reigned for fifty-one years and lived to seventy-two years of age.

Regarding King Gihon, his childhood name and divine title are not recorded. He reigned for eleven years. When he was fifty-four years old, he advised Eiso, saying: "Now if you take charge of governance, the years will be abundant and the people will be at peace. You should properly inherit the great lineage and become the father and mother of the people." Though Eiso firmly declined, all the court ministers jointly persuaded him to ascend the throne. After Gihon abdicated, his place of retirement is unknown. Therefore, his lifespan and death year are not recorded and cannot be verified today. (The bloodline of Tametomo-ko ended after three generations from King Shunten to Gihon. The three kings ruled for approximately seventy-three years.)

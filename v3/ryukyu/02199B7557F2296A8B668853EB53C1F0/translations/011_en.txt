Since there was no exchange with that country, even what occasionally appeared in records was merely hearsay and conjecture, and the lack of reliable information is thought to be for this reason. That country was also a distant island nation that was not a vassal of any country and had no diplomatic communications. However, during the Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty, when Ryukyu was under King Satto, through the investiture system, it was enfeoffed as the King of Chuzan by China, and there was exchange with that country, with all institutions and culture following Chinese models. In the 7th year of Xuande of the Ming dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong commanded his eunuch official Zishan to carry an imperial edict to the Ryukyu Kingdom, and the King of Chuzan sent people to establish diplomatic relations with our country. This 7th year of Xuande corresponds to the 4th year of Eikyō in our country. Considering this, exchanges had ceased early on since ancient times, and when later envoys were sent to our country at the behest of Ming Emperor Xuanzong, this was probably the beginning of Ryukyu envoys coming to our country again after many years had passed. Even after this, in the 1st year of Zhengtong of the Ming dynasty, Emperor Yingzong had the Ryukyu tribute envoy Wu Shijian carry a reply edict to admonish Japanese King Minamoto no Yoshinori, {{This was in the 8th year of Eikyō}} and in the 3rd year of Jiajing, the Ryukyu administrator Jin Liang was made to relay instructions to the Japanese King {{This was in the 4th year of Daiei ○ Chuzan denshinroku, Ryukyu kokushi-ryaku}}. Given these events, letters were sent to our country from the Ming period

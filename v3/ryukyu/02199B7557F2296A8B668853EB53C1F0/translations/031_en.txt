King Shō Sei──King Shō Kō──────────

King Shō Iku──King Shō Tai───────

The above is an outline of the Chūzan royal lineage. This is recorded based on the Chūzan Seifu (Genealogy of Chūzan), which was compiled by order of King Shō Tei of Ryukyu, who commanded a person named Shō Kōtoku to create it.

Chinzei Hachirō Tametomo

Chinzei Hachirō Tametomo was exiled to Izu Ōshima, but in the first year of Eiman (1165), in the third month, he saw a white heron flying toward the open sea and thought, "There must surely be an island there." He boarded a boat and sailed in pursuit. When he arrived at a certain island and traveled around it, he found neither rice fields nor dry fields. When he asked, "What do you eat for sustenance?" they answered, "Fish and birds." These birds were about the size of bulbuls. Seeing this, Tametomo shot down birds perching in trees and killed birds flying in the sky with large whistling arrows. The islanders trembled with fear and terror. When he declared, "If you do not submit to me, I will shoot and kill you in the same manner," they all prostrated themselves and submitted. When he asked the name of the island, they said it was called "Oni-ga-shima" (Demon Island). 《From the Hōgen Monogatari》This Oni-ga-shima to which Tametomo sailed is none other than the present-day Ryukyu Kingdom. Thus the people of the country were awed and submitted to his military prowess.

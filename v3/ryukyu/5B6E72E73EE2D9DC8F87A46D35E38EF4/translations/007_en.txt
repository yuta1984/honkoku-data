○In the country, there are three types of people who shave their hair like monks. One type is doctors, called "Gokanshō" (Five Officials Chief). One type serves as tea ceremony officials in the royal palace, called "Sōsō" (Tea Masters). One type is garden supervisors. All wear black half-hats. Now there are no people who shave their heads. ○There are only two Buddhist sects: Shingon and Rinzai. Tenkaiji Temple serves as the burial ground of the former king. Generally, monks are prohibited by the Qing from entering mainland China to study, so both sects come to Satsuma domain to study. Before the Kyōhō era, Ryukyu monks would travel throughout the provinces of Japan, but now it has become a national prohibition and they only pass through Satsuma territory.

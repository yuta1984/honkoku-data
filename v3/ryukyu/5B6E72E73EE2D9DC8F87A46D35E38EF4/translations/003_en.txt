○The Beginning of Travel to Japan
According to the "Ryukyu Jiryaku," in the seventh month of Hōtoku 3 of Emperor Go-Hanazono's reign, Ryukyuans came and presented 1,000 kan of coins and local products to Shogun Yoshimasa. From this time, people from that country came to Hyōgo-no-ura to trade. Considering the timing, this was when King Shō Kinpuku, the fifteenth [king], was on the throne. After four reigns spanning the eras of Go-Hanazono, Go-Tsuchimikado, Go-Kashiwabara, and Go-Nara—a period of 123 years—in the eleventh year of Genki under Emperor Ōgimachi, Ryukyuans came and presented local products.

Since Satsuma Province was a neighboring domain, they maintained deep friendship, naming their vessels "Aya-bune" and sending gifts annually. However, during the Keichō era, a sanshikan (councilor) of that country named Jana conspired with the Ming Dynasty to persuade the king to cease travel to Japan. Therefore, the lord of Satsuma, Shimazu Mutsu-no-kami Iehisa, sent an envoy to investigate the reason. When Jana behaved with various discourtesies toward the envoy, Iehisa became greatly enraged. In the same thirteenth year, he went to Sunpu, had an audience with the Divine Ruler (Tokugawa Ieyasu), and requested permission to send troops for punitive action. The Divine Ruler commanded that it should be left to Iehisa's discretion, so in February of the following year, he dispatched several hundred warships for attack. The warriors distinguished themselves in battle and stormed into Shuri in April of the same year, capturing King Shō Nei and returning in triumph. King Shō Nei remained in Japan for three years, repenting his errors and apologizing for his crimes, before finally being allowed to return to his homeland. This was in Keichō 16. At this time, the Divine Ruler granted Ryukyu to Iehisa as a tributary domain, making it a permanently attached country, and their service as vassals became highly respected. Since then, when there is a change of shogun, the shogun's commands are transmitted through the lord of Satsuma, after which [the Ryukyu king] succeeds to the throne and later sends envoys of gratitude. Since that country lies between China and Japan, when succeeding to the throne, they also receive investiture from the Qing. However, since China is far and Japan is near, without Japanese assistance they cannot even manage daily expenses. Therefore, the people of that country call [Japan] "Ōmato" (Yamato) and greatly revere Japan.

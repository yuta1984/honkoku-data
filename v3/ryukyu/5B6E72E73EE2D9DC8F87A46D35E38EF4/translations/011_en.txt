Although Ryukyu lies in our southern seas, separated by over a thousand ri, it is naturally easy to reach by ship, and moreover, in terms of the character of its people and the state of all affairs, it is extremely close to our Imperial Country. From ancient times, the countries that have submitted as vassals to our court are considered to be Qing, Korea, Ryukyu, and Holland. Qing engages only in trade and remains in Nagasaki; Korea does not come to the capital now; Holland comes to the capital but with only three people at most. Only Ryukyu's diplomatic envoys are sufficient for observing and understanding the grand ceremonies of our enlightened age's treatment of foreign peoples. Moreover, while the martial prowess of Satsuma Domain is widely known, the fact that its brilliance extends to future generations even to this day of a hundred generations is incomparable to others. Now, citing various theories of our predecessors, I compile this small booklet and publish it to show this grand affair to children and young people.

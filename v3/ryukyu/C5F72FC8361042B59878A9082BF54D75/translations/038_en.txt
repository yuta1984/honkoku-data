《marginal note: Children of Shuri and Naha only receive stipends when they serve up to the rank of Treasury Official. Below this rank, all are without stipends.》

The above are the numbers of official stipends for Kumemura and the Chinese quarter.

From Ear-Eye Officials downward, large and small officials who have merit pass on hereditary stipends and fiefs to their children and grandchildren. All differences are made according to merit.

Farmland

All farmland is cultivated and planted in the ninth and tenth months, with harvest completed in the fifth month. For the fiefs granted to each official, all personally go to their lands to oversee plowing and harvesting. There are officials, or sometimes their children supervise this. In the tenth and eleventh months, green seedlings all emerge from water, and seedlings are divided and planted. This is done during heavy rains. Thunder develops and earthworms cry out. The climate is like spring. North winds occasionally arise, but are not severely cold. In late eleventh month, one Additional Reviewer and two Inspector-Attendant Record Officials are dispatched to patrol each village separately and encourage agriculture. They return only after more than a month. In the sixth month, great hurricanes frequently occur, sea rains fly horizontally, and all fruits fall. This happens every year as a regular occurrence. Unless the harvest is completed early, there will certainly be much trouble from uprooted rice plants. Therefore, in that country, those who plow in autumn, plant in winter, weed in spring, and harvest in summer do so for two reasons: first, to take advantage of rainfall, and second, to avoid the harm of typhoons. Though warm throughout the year and theoretically suitable for double cropping, the reason fields lie fallow after the sixth month is due to this.

Calendar

The calendar follows the orthodox calendar. When tribute envoys reach the capital, they must wait for the calendar distribution on the first day of the tenth month, then bring it back to the country, by which time more than half a year has already passed. Therefore, the people of the country established a Calendar Interpreter Official (seventh rank) who calculates in advance and creates calendars for practical use. On the calendar it is written: "The Ryukyu Kingdom Calendar Official respectfully follows the imperial decree and hereby creates the selection..."

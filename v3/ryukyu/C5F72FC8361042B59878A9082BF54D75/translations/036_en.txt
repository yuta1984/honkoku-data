Those who are granted (fiefs) pass down their stipends through generations, with the eldest son inheriting. The fiefs granted to those who attained their rank and position through their own efforts are immediately removed when they retire from office. Annually, they collect two-thirds of what the land produces. For example, if one qing of rice field produces one hundred koku of rice, the farmer collects fifty koku and the fief lord collects fifty koku. Within the fief lord's fifty koku, there are more than ten koku for public expenses, miscellaneous costs, etc. Excluding this, they actually collect more than thirty koku. This amounts to approximately two-thirds. The numbers of chickens, pigs, firewood, and timber are taken according to the season, based on the amount of rice koku as the standard. Those from the fief territories who come to receive official duties are assigned amounts according to their official rank. The sixteen positions of National Minister and Legal Administrator, eleven Purple-Gold Grand Masters, ten Purple-Cap Officials, four Yellow-Cap Officials, and two Red-Cap Officials all rotate monthly.

Those with merit receive additional seven, eight, or nine hundred, stopping at one thousand koku.

　　Family Clans

The four great surnames of Shuri are: Sho, O, Mo, and Ba. The Sho clan is a branch family of the royal Sho surname. When the relationship becomes distant, they are called Sho to distinguish them. Therefore, they do not intermarry with the royal family for generations. Among the native people who intermarry with the royal family, there are only the three families: O, Mo, and Ba. They serve as royal uncles and legal administrators for generations. Currently, there are three people serving as legal administrators: Ba Kenzu, O Jido, and Sho Sei[■]. Kokutake Mo Kunshu. 《Marginal note: The consort of the maternal grandfather of the current king Sho Kei was from the Ba clan.》 The genealogies are all not yet clear. We shall wait for further investigation to list them in the genealogy.

The thirty-six surnames of Kumemura were all Fujian people granted by the Hongwu and Yongle reigns. By the Wanli period, only five surnames remained: Sai, Tei, Ryo, Kin, and Rin. Those additionally granted in the thirty-fifth year of Wanli were two surnames: Gen and Mo. The descendants of each surname have not multiplied greatly. Many others who became prominent did so after registering and establishing their families, but they are not from the original granted surnames. Now reading through the genealogies of the nine surnames, many study books at the national academy.

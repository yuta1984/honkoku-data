Regarding the Queen Consorts of Previous Dynasties
The previous diagram in "Chūzan Enkaku-shi" (Historical Records of Chūzan) by the former envoy Wang Ji has a somewhat confused sequence. Now I examine and correct it.
All kings are called "Shinshu" (Divine Lord). Only the four kings Nei, Hō, Ken, and Shitsu are called "Sonrei" (Revered Spirit). Their posthumous names are also added to their titles. Nei is called "Kōō," Hō is called "Sōsei," Ken is called "Shūei," and Shitsu is called "Chokukō."

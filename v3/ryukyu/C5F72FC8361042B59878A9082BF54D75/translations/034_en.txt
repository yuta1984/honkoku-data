On the Selection of Officials
Among the people of the country, those who enter government service are only from the four villages of Shuri, Tomari, Naha, and Kume. All others are village households (farmers). Among them, those who have some understanding of national script (Chinese characters) become chieftains. These are called "okite" (regulations). 《Marginal note: Local name is Sanpaki》They receive official documents, mobilize villagers, and assign corvée labor. The next rank becomes village headmen. These are called "sakuji-sha" (work supervisors). 《Marginal note: Local name is Sanpekiko》All serve in lower positions, wear blue-green caps, serve for life in these roles, and do not receive promotions.
The people of the three villages of Shuri, Tomari, and Naha are called "jin'ya." The children of officials who have not yet entered service are called "ko" (sons). Sons shave their topknots and are promoted to "chikutō-no." This is the rank of "tōshi-rō" (entering service gentleman). The next is named "chikutō-no-za" and becomes "tōshi-sa-rō" (entering service assistant gentleman). There are also those named "ōhitsu-sha," "fukuhitsu-sha," and "taikan-hitsu-sha." These are like the clerical assistants of China. There are also those named "waka-hitsu-sha." These are like the official students of China. They assist in village and county administration [text cuts off]

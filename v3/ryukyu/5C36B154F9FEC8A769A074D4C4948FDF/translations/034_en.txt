The fragrance shines and longevity increases the crimson sky, in the longevity banquet hall the wine flows freely
Again, one only sees on the flower-grass mountain a white monkey comes to offer immortal peaches

　　Old Star of Longevity (Reushinrau) - Ming melody (Minkyo)
Old Star of Longevity, you have mounted the immortal crane, Dongfang Shuo in mid-air
passes and sees the immortal brightness. Ah, Purple Forbidden Star and Literary Curve Star, you come respectfully as immortals
When you arrive, the Eight Immortals come to pay respects escorting the Queen Mother, bestowing coiled peaches. Upon arrival, immortal
wine is offered. Divine immortal, your longevity never ages again

There was Yi Yin - in former times his body was poor and he struggled with the plow and hoe as his occupation. Engaging closely in farming, he went to till the land at Youxin
Ah, rejoicing in the reign of Yao and singing of the days of Shun, he could be content with his lot. One morning he met a sage ruler
Through three summons he established meritorious deeds. The Jin histories record his name with glory surpassing the splendor of brocade worn in daylight

　　First Month (Chinyeu) - Qing melody (Chinkyo)
In the first month's celebration, after viewing the lanterns, Qingming arrives and one exits through Chang Gate. At Da Ma Tou
crossing over the suspension bridge. Ah, coming to see the village of peach blossoms and apricot flowers
arriving at the Huang family residence. Maple Mountain is distant, Guanyin Mountain is high and ever higher. By the rocks
at Maple Bridge, thinking carefully, one rejoices in observing the beauty of Tiger Hill Mountain

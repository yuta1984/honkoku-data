1. Copy of Letter from Ryukyu and Reply Letter (Note: The reply letter was given at the time of departure)

Humbly composing this letter to present to Your Excellency, I respectfully state:
In your noble country, the Great Lord has newly succeeded to the national leadership, and as the four seas enjoy ascending peace and all auspicious omens have arrived, how could our small nation not also offer congratulations like those of the Chinese realm? Now, I especially dispatch my minister Prince Misato, offering humble tribute goods, and respectfully present them following our lord of Satsuma, Major General Yoshitaka.

[Note from the Hōrei Bunko "Ryukyu Tribute Records": "On the 18th day of the 11th month of Hōei 7, King Shō Eki of Chūzan sent congratulatory envoys Prince Misato and Tomimori Oya, and gratitude envoys Prince Tomigusuku and Yoza Oya to present tribute goods."]

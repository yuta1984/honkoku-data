The ability to determine these go techniques comes from the request of the King of Chuzan. I permitted this and had him play against the national master with a two-stone handicap. Observing his play, his natural talent and ability are not ordinary, showing ingenuity. If he accumulates years and months of sincere study and continues to exert his full efforts for a long time, his progress would be immeasurable. It is regrettable that our meeting has been brief and the time of parting draws near, so I cannot provide frequent instruction. However, the game of go is based on the principles of yin-yang transformation, and all methods of governing a country and ruling people exist within it. Its essence lies only in the space of a thousandth of an inch. After returning by ship, if you strive without negligence and concentrate your heart and will, then even though separated by a thousand ri, it will still be as if you were close at hand. This Way exists within oneself—why would one need to seek it outside?

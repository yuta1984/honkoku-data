On November 21st of the Kanoe-Tora year, we went to the castle and respectfully performed Ming-Qing songs at Kinjo
　　Yang Xiang (Yanhyan) - Ming melody (Minkyo)
Yang Xiang fights the tiger - At the age of exactly fourteen, with a pure and good nature, he devoted filial piety to his father. Together they went to the fields,
harvesting millet at the field's edge, then passing through and entering a hill where they saw a fierce tiger running toward them. The father became frantic, seeing the tiger about to
seize his father and carry him away, in anger Yang Xiang tried to kill [the tiger]. Ah, advancing forward to save his father with no sword or spear in hand, he leaped
forward with hurried movements, only thinking to pacify his father without regard for his own death, pressing down on the tiger's
head. Ah, swinging his raised head and kicking its eye sockets, that old tiger ran away and thus his father was
protected and the parent was ultimately unharmed. In pursuing learning, one should know the proper direction. When discussing self-cultivation, one must fully practice frugality and
courtesy, being gentle and good while seeking benevolence. Even if not yet entering Zhongyu's hall, one should be content in poverty and lie down in Yan Hui's alley. This is
the spirit of a man - strive and strengthen yourself. The traditional teachings of sages and worthies - quiet your heart and contemplate deeply.

　　Longevity to the Venerable Elder (Shutsuhon'on) - Qing melody
Celebrating the venerable elder's longevity comparable to the height of Nanshan, his lifespan endless like the vast ocean of fortune
Ah, the incense of the longevity burner floats ethereally before the venerable one, the target of longevity candles

Respectfully composing this letter to express my humble intentions. Last year, Satsuma Lord Major General Yoshitaka, in accordance with the imperial command, permitted this humble person to succeed to the work of my predecessors, and with no disturbances in our poor country, our joy knows no bounds. Now, wishing to bow in gratitude for this great benevolence, following Yoshitaka, I have my retainer Prince Tomigusuku present tribute bearers. I humbly hope that through the guidance of the honorable senior councilors, if this is conveyed solely to your noble attention, I cannot contain my utmost gratitude. I am truly in awe and inadequately prepared.

King of Chūzan

The Minister submitted a detailed report on May 8th regarding the circumstances of the aforementioned persuasion, stating that the establishment of a branch garrison should be implemented regardless of whether the domain accepts it or not, and that he wished to abolish tribute missions and congratulatory missions to Qing China. He requested to establish standards based on current government policy and set up an order of implementation. The government then issued instructions that tribute and congratulatory missions, investiture ceremonies, and the Ryukyu館 in Fuzhou should be abolished, and that matters such as the domain king's trip to Tokyo to express gratitude, domain administration reform, and dispatching officials had already been approved, so the order and urgency of implementation should be further investigated and reported again. 《Note: Details are found in the First Ryukyu Mission Records》

In the same month of May, the government issued orders to dispatch Interior Ministry Deputy Minister Matsuda Michiyuki to prohibit the Ryukyu domain from paying tribute to Qing China and receiving investiture upon succession. Deputy Minister Matsuda investigated the order and urgency of implementation and sought government approval.

On June 12th, he departed Tokyo together with domain officials Ikegusuku Pēchin and Yonabaru Pēchin, arriving in Ryukyu on July 10th.

On the 14th of the same month, Deputy Minister Matsuda entered Shuri Castle together with his deputy Ijichi Sadayoshi and others, and delivered an official notice. At this time, due to the domain king's illness, his younger brother Prince Nakijin served as proxy. The official notice was as follows:

To Ryukyu Domain
Regarding your domain's affairs: while there has been a custom of dispatching envoys to Qing China under the name of "biennial tribute" and sending congratulatory missions on occasions such as the enthronement of Qing emperors, these practices shall be discontinued from now on.

Regarding the practice of receiving investiture from Qing China upon the succession of domain kings, this shall also be discontinued from now on.

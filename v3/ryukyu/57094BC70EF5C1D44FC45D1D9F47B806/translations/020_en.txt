Since the disposition of the entire Ryukyu Kingdom had been roughly determined, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs delivered the following document to the Ryukyu officials:

1. His Excellency the Domain Lord was granted investiture by special imperial command last year and was declared to be a permanent domain bulwark. Therefore, unless there are acts of defiance against the Imperial Court or brutal deeds that cause the dispersal of the common people, there will naturally be no measures to abolish the domain.

1. The Domain Lord's educational policies have been thorough, and he has governed without resorting to punishment for several decades. This shows he has not dishonored his official duties, which is admirable. We hope he will continue to protect the common people with even greater dedication for many years to come.

1. Since the original documents of treaties concluded with various countries by that domain in previous years have been submitted, there will definitely be no arrangements that would cause difficulties for the domain or result in inconvenience.

1. Even for countries other than France, America, and Holland with which that domain has not concluded treaties, when ships from countries with which the Imperial Court has

already concluded treaties arrive within that domain, please follow the directives of officials dispatched by this ministry and provide generous treatment in accordance with the treaties concluded with France, America, and Holland.

Regarding the above matters, I have received acknowledgment from Foreign Minister Soejima Taneomi. I hereby communicate this for your information.

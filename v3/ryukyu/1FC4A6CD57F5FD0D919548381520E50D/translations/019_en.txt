Reply from the Council of Elders to the Chūzan King, folded horizontally

We have reviewed your submitted letter.
That the three lords are in increasingly good health is indeed a matter of great joy.
Regarding the matter of the succession, to offer congratulations, you have now sent
Prince Gushikawa as an envoy with offerings as listed in the catalog.
He was summoned before [the Shōgun] and there was great pleasure expressed. Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami will provide further details.
With utmost respect and reverence.

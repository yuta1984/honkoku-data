Letter from the Ryukyu Chūzan King, Volume 3, on formal paper

I respectfully present this letter.
To the Shōgun, the Retired Shōgun, and the Dainagon, I trust you are all in excellent health, which fills me with great joy. Now, regarding
the matter of sending an envoy to offer congratulations on the succession, I petitioned through Ōsumi-no-kami, and as requested, permission was graciously granted,
for which I am most grateful. Therefore, as congratulations, I am now sending Prince Gushikawa.
Additionally, I present one ceremonial sword, one horse, and items as listed in the catalog. I humbly request your favorable consideration. With utmost respect and reverence.

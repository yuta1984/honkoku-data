Record of Ryukyuan Tribute Envoys, Volume One
The matter of Shimazu Iehisa's conquest of Ryukyu and first bringing them to pay court to Japan

First, in the second month of Keichō 14 (1609), Shimazu Iehisa, lord of Satsuma domain, received orders from Tōshō-gū (Tokugawa Ieyasu) and attacked Ryukyu Kingdom. This country is located in the south of the Eastern Sea and is called Great Ryukyu and Small Ryukyu. It faces the territories of Min-Yue and Fujian (China), and with favorable winds, one can reach Ryukyu from Fujian in seven days. From Satsuma it is 350 ri, and even during storms, one can arrive within ten days.

During the time of Taikō Hideyoshi, Ryukyu sent envoys and paid tribute in order to establish trade relations. There was ship traffic between Satsuma and Ōsumi due to favorable sea routes. When the Great Ming (China) heard of this, they pressured Ryukyu and severed communications with Japan. From this time, there had been no communication from Ryukyu for more than ten years. Iehisa reported this matter.

This mountain is about one hundred ri from the Chūzan royal capital and is located at the Japanese frontier. When Shimazu forces reached Nihon-yama and suddenly attacked with bows and firearms, many Ryukyuan soldiers were killed, the army was defeated, and they fled.

Shimazu forces landed at other harbors, and after three days of fighting, they entered the capital. They surrounded the royal castle and greatly destroyed it. When the Chūzan King and all the royal family surrendered, Yokoyama and others sent urgent word to Iehisa by fast ship. Iehisa dispatched messengers to Edo and Sunpu to report this.

In the fifth month, as the Chūzan King became a captive, Shimazu forces captured the Chūzan King along with his sons, nephews, consorts, and concubines, and returned with additional troops. Iehisa placed Chūzan King Shō Nei in a guest residence, treated him with kind care and protection, and sent reports to Sunpu and Edo. In the seventh month, when Shimazu's report reached Sunpu, Tōshō-gū was greatly pleased, sent a letter to Iehisa praising his achievement, and [regarding] Ryukyu and its prince...

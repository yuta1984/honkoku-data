[The elders] bowed three times toward them. At this time, the ceremonial presenter brought out the ceremonial sword catalog and announced it on behalf of the King of Chūzan at the southern central pillar of the same location. Without placing the ceremonial sword catalog down, it was concluded and Gushikawa withdrew outside the wooden doors.

1. Gushikawa appeared again and performed his personal courtesy with three bows on the southern side below the second tatami from the threshold, above the third room. After the ceremonial presenter made the announcement at the same southern pillar, he withdrew to the jōdan room.

1. Gushikawa Prince, envoy of the Ryukyu King of Chūzan, completed [the ceremony] at the main castle and ascended to Nishinomaru castle. The route and other details followed the same procedure as during the courtesy ceremony.

1. When Gushikawa Prince reached the top of the entrance steps, two chief inspectors came out to guide him and he took his seat in the lower section of the jōdan room. His attendants did likewise and lined up in the next room, while the lower-ranking officials waited in the entrance courtyard.

1. Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami ascended to the castle and took his seat in the upper part of the lower section of the jōdan room, wearing long hakama.

1. All those in attendance wore long hakama.

1. In the second room of the Great Hall, Oki-no-kami, Tajima-no-kami, Ukon-shōgen, Hotta Kaga-no-kami, Kobori Izumi-no-kami, Miura Shima-no-kami, and Toda Awaji-no-kami positioned themselves against the northern sliding screens and sat in order toward the east. At this time, Satsuma-no-kami took his seat on the southern side of those seats in advance. Afterward, guided by two chief inspectors, Gushikawa came from the jōdan room to sit facing west at the threshold of the third room of the Great Hall. Separately, the elders bowed once and exchanged courtesies with each other. When Gushikawa appeared within the threshold, he accompanied Satsuma-no-kami to the center of the second room. At this time:

"Regarding the succession, [we] are pleased that [you] have come from afar to offer [congratulations]. Silver and court robes shall be bestowed upon the King of Chūzan."

From Ōgosho-sama and Dainagon-sama: Oki-no-kami and Tajima-no-kami conveyed the purport of the supreme will, and Satsuma-no-kami and Gushikawa bowed once.

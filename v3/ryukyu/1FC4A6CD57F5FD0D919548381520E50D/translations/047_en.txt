The Kingdom of Ryukyu is located to the southwest of Japan, an island nation in the sea more than 300 ri from Satsuma. To the southwest of Ryukyu lies the Kingdom of Siam, and to the northeast it faces Japan. The journey takes seven to eight days east-west and twelve to thirteen days north-south. The four seasons are warm, and rice paddies are cultivated twice a year. In waka poetry it is referred to as "Uruma no shima" (the island of Uruma). [Ryukyu] has been coming to court since around the 15th year of Keichō.

At this time, the 1st year of Kan'en (Boshin, 1748)
During the reign of the 108th Human Sovereign, Emperor Go-Yōzei, in the 15th year of Keichō, Ryukyu was conquered, and since then [they] have come to court in each generation. How truly prosperous! As an example of Japan's blessed reign that will flourish for thousands of generations, may it last for a thousand autumns and ten thousand years.

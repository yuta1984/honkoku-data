　　Preface to the Record of Ryukyu Tribute Envoys
　　　　　　Reference on the Founding Ancestor of Ryukyu Kingdom
　　　
In Master Tōgai's "Candlelight Conversations":
　The Ryukyu Kingdom was not known in previous eras
Since the Sui period it has communicated with China. In the Huanyu Ji of the Song History, it is written as "Liuqiu"
In the Ou History it is written as "Liuqiu." Upon my examination, in one text it is written as "Liuxiu." The
topographical features of that country are like a flowing dragon, hence the name. The ruler's surname is said to be Huansi
This must refer to the Sui period. In Ming dynasty Shao Jingbang's Hongjian Lu annotation it says: Liu-
qiu has no verifiable records from ancient times. Its genealogical chart states that in the fourteenth year of Chunxi of the Song dynasty, Shun-
ten ascended to the throne, and so forth. Shunten is said to be the son of Japan's Minamoto no Tametomo [details unclear]

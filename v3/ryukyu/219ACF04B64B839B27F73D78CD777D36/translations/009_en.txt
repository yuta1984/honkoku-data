They stationed officials in rotation to oversee and carry out orders. This was similar to how the various feudal lords related to the Tokugawa clan. Regarding the establishment of government positions, definition of duties, creation of institutional systems, and criminal administration, everything was left to the disposition of the king. This was also similar to how various domains conducted internal reforms, while the Tokugawa clan controlled the overall situation. However, the Shimazu clan separately dispatched officials to monitor the entire island. When cities suffered disasters, they provided timber; when years brought poor harvests or famine, they provided relief loans of money and grain. The methods by which they provided care and protection were numerous. In the winter of Meiji 4 (1871), under domain orders, Sadayoshi advised the king to reduce bureaucratic formalities, eliminate empty ceremonies, and generally conform to the court's standards. The Shimazu clan's loans had accumulated to several tens of thousands, which Okinawa bore as debt, but Sadayoshi brought the loan certificates and returned them to the king. The king was deeply moved and rejoiced. He then forgave the islanders' delinquent taxes of over one hundred thousand gold pieces and completely followed the advised proposals. In July of the following year, he completed his mission and returned home.

　　Recruitment of Officials

Those who enter government service in the country are only from the four villages of Shuri, Tomari, Naha, and Kume; all others are rural households. Among these, only those with some knowledge of the national script become village chiefs called "sadame" 《Note: in local dialect "sanpakwi"》 who receive official documents, mobilize villagers, and assign corvée labor. Next are the security chiefs called "sashikusha" 《Note: in local dialect "sanpekuko"》 who all serve in lower positions, wear blue-green caps, and remain in these positions for life without promotion.

The people of the three villages of Shuri, Tomari, and Naha are called "niya," and the children of officials who have not yet entered service are called "shi." The shi shave the tops of their heads, and when promoted to "chikudunushi" they become junior clerks. Next there is the rank called "chikudunushiza" which corresponds to assistant junior clerk. There are also ranks called "ufuhiccha," "fukuhiccha," and "ufukan hiccha" which are like the clerical assistants of China. There is also a rank called "wakahiccha" which is like the student officials of China, assisting in village and county administration.

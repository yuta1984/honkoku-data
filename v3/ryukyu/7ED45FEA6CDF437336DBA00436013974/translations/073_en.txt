　Previous Royal Consorts
　　The former envoy Wang Ji's "Chronicle of Chuzan" had some disorder in the sequence of the front diagram, so this has now been investigated and corrected.
　　All kings are called "shinshu" (sacred tablets), but only the four kings Nei, Ho, Ken, and Shitsu are called "sonrei" (honored spirits), and additionally their
　　temple names are added: Nei is called Koō, Ho is called Sōsei, Ken is called Shūei, and Shitsu is called Chokukō.

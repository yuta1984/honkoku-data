《Note: Children of Naha only receive salaries when they reach the position of Warehouse Official; below this rank, none receive salaries》

The above are the numbers of salaries and stipends for the Tang-camp officials of Kumemura.

Among the Jimoku Officials and below, large and small officials who have merit have their hereditary stipends and fiefs transmitted to their descendants, all with differences made according to measured merit.

Agricultural Land

All agricultural land is cultivated and planted in the ninth and tenth months, with harvest completed in the fifth month. For the fiefs granted to each official, they personally go to those lands to oversee cultivation and harvest, with officials or their children supervising. In the tenth and eleventh months, all the green seedlings emerge from the water, and the seedlings are divided and transplanted. Heavy rains fall from time to time, thunder rumbles and earthworms emerge and sing, with weather like spring. North winds blow intermittently but are not severely cold. In late November, one Ka'etsusha is dispatched for inspection and attendance, and two Record Officials tour the villages separately to encourage agriculture, returning only after more than a month. In the sixth month, great hurricanes frequently occur, with sea rains flying horizontally causing all fruits to fall, which happens every year as a matter of course. If the harvest is not completed early, there will surely be much suffering from uprooted rice plants. Therefore, in that country they plow in autumn, plant in winter, weed in spring, and harvest in summer. This serves both to take advantage of rain and moisture and to avoid the harm of typhoons and hurricanes. The year-round warmth would theoretically allow for double cropping, but after the sixth month all fields lie fallow with nothing planted for this reason.

Calendar

For the calendar, they follow the official calendar, and when tribute envoys reach the capital, they must wait for the tenth month's first day to receive the distributed calendar and return. By the time they reach the country, more than half a year has already passed. Therefore, the people of the country establish Calendar Interpreter officials of the seventh rank who perform advance calculations and calendar-making for practical use. On the calendar face is written: "The Calendar Official of Ryukyu Kingdom respectfully follows the imperial command and hereby creates and selects."

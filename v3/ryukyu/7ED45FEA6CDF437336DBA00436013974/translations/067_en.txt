Those who are granted fiefs inherit their stipends hereditarily, with the eldest son succeeding to them. The fiefs granted according to ranks they themselves achieved are removed when they retire from office. They collect two-thirds of the annual produce from that land. For example, if one chō of rice fields produces one hundred koku of rice, the cultivator receives fifty koku and the fief holder receives fifty koku. Within the fief holder's fifty koku, there are public expenses, miscellaneous costs, etc. totaling over ten koku. Excluding these, the actual income is over thirty koku, approximately equivalent to two-thirds. The quantities of chickens, pigs, firewood, and timber are determined based on the amount of rice koku, and these are taken seasonally. Among the people of those fiefs who come to serve in office, the number varies according to official rank: Kokusō (State Ministers) and Hōji (Legal Officers) sixteen people, Purple Gold Grand Masters eleven people, Purple Cap Officials ten people, Yellow Cap Officials four people, Red Cap Officials two people, all rotating monthly.

The Kokusō's fief is one prefecture 《Note: or two prefectures》 with a stipend of six hundred koku; those with merit receive additional seven, eight, or nine hundred, up to one thousand koku. For hereditary succession, heir sons and grandsons are granted stipends of three hundred koku and fiefs of one prefecture; for great-grandsons, differences are made according to measured merit.

Hōji's fief is one prefecture with a stipend of four hundred koku. As precedent for hereditary stipends, heir sons and grandsons are granted stipends of eighty koku and fiefs of one prefecture; for great-grandsons, differences are made according to measured merit.

Kokukyu's (Royal Uncle's) fief is one prefecture 《Note: or one county》 with stipends of eighty koku, or one hundred or two hundred koku, all granted according to measured merit. Hereditary stipends determine grants of stipends, fiefs, and benefits to descendants according to the magnitude of merit.

Purple Cap Officials' fiefs are one prefecture 《Note: or one county》 with stipends of thirty koku, or forty, fifty, up to eighty koku, all granted according to the magnitude of merit. Hereditary stipends make differences according to measured merit.

Shihin (Protocol Officers) and Jimoku Officials' fiefs are also one prefecture with stipends of eighty koku. Tenhō (Treasury), Shikei (Criminal Justice), and Kanpaku (Harbor Management)

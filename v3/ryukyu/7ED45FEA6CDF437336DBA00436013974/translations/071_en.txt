In these months, the king observes ritual purification and conducts sacrificial ceremonies for the mountain, sea, and protective deities of the nation, or dispatches officials to perform the rituals. The deity of Mount Ben is named Shukushuku, who is the second daughter of the Tenson clan. A sacred wall surrounds the area on all sides, with densely clustered trees, and a small gate facing south from within. Outside the gate are two wooden pavilions, with small stone pagodas and stone lamp stands on the left side, five on each side. Upon entering the gate, stone steps turn north then east, with dozens of steps leading to the summit where there is nothing but a stone brazier with dozens of incense sticks burning. This is the place for worshipping the main mountain deity. The flat ground in front of the wooden pavilions is square and spacious, facing south with a view of the sea, and to the southeast there is a stone brazier where incense is burned as a place for worshipping the sea deity. Throughout the country, wherever there are densely wooded areas surrounded by low walls with small inward-facing gates, these are all called "gaku" (sacred peaks), like the earth deities of China, and every village has them.

【Sogenji Temple - Former Kings' Shrine】Spring and autumn sacrifices are held, either with the king personally conducting them or dispatching officials. Three days of purification are observed, and the music used is exclusively the Tenson Taihei songs, singing of the virtues and merits of the ancestors and the enduring spiritual legacy through the ages.

【Engakuji Temple】For the main sect's incense offerings, there are seasonal sacrifices and monthly sacrifices 《Note: called Urabon Festival》, with three days of purification. On death anniversaries there are special sacrifices, and on new and full moons tea is offered. The rituals at Tenno-ji and Tenkai-ji temples are the same.

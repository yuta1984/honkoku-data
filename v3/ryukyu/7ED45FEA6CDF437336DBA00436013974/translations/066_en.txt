The children of hereditary officials are called "Satunushi" (village lord's son), which means prince. In the local name it is "Sashido nushi" 《Note: In local pronunciation, the two characters Sashido are read like the character Sato, the character nu like shi, and the character shi like ko》. Young ones serve as inner attendant pages with the title "Satunushi kōkyū naiyaku shin" as personal attendants. When they pass fifteen years and reach eighteen, they shave the center of their heads and change to a small topknot. Then they no longer enter the inner palace but are granted land and become "Satunushi Peekumii," gradually advancing to become Ōyakata (親方).

Kume Village consists entirely of the thirty-six surname families who were granted citizenship from Fujian Province. Among their outstanding children aged fifteen or sixteen, three or four are selected as recommended scholars. The thirteen or fourteen who are not selected are named "Waka Sōsai" (young scholars) and taught reading and writing. These scholars are tested every year in the twelfth month, given topics from the Four Books and required to compose one poem of either eight or four lines. Those who are capable have their names recorded and are promoted to assistant interpreters. From this they gradually advance to Purple Gold Grand Master 《Note: Purple Gold Grand Master is also called Ōyakata》.
　　This is the beginning of official service for children of Kume.

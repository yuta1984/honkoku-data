In the central bay of the Buddhist hall, Buddha is enshrined, and the left and right sides are like side chambers storing the spirit tablets of former kings who have already been moved to the ancestral shrine (tao). The right gallery in front of the Buddhist hall serves as a spirit hall, with two halls standing side by side. Each hall has three bays, all facing south. The upper hall has three niches: the center is for Sho En, Ryu Keiun-kun, which is his posthumous name. This is the founding ancestor of the kingdom. The left niche is for Sho Shitsu, the great-great-grandfather of the current king, and the right niche is for Sho Tei, the great-grandfather of the current king. The three niches of the lower hall are for Sho Shin, who was the son of Sho En and is considered the Taizong (Grand Ancestor) of the kingdom. Together with the founding ancestor Sho En, he is a perpetual tablet (bu tao), so both occupy the central niche. The left niche is for Sho Eki, father of the current king, and the right niche is for Sho Jun, grandfather of the current king. The father being placed on the left and grandfather on the right is because once the zhao-mu positions are determined, there is no concern about equal honor.

　Tenno-ji Temple also has spirit tablets. The Buddhist hall faces south with three bays: the center enshrines Buddha, and the left bay has two spirit tablets. One reads "귀진 Sho Shoku Spirit Tablet," who was the father of founding ancestor Sho En. The other reads "귀진 Sho Kyu Spirit Tablet," and Sho Kyu was the father of King Sho Ho and the third son of Sho Gen. Both were fathers of kings but never became kings themselves, so they are separately enshrined here. The two tablets nearby are for royal consorts. The four tablets in the right bay are all for royal consorts.

　Tenkai-ji Temple contains the spirit tablet of Sho I, who was the father of King Sho Nei. The temple is entirely for female spirits, enshrining royal consorts and royal sisters who married and have family shrines, who may also be included in worship.

　When Crown Prince Sho Eki died, after the initial burial, his spirit tablet was placed in the Crown Prince's residence, where male and female officials wore mourning clothes and performed daily crying rituals. After one hundred days, the tablet was moved to Tenkai-ji Temple, where men and women also performed daily incense and silk offerings. After the three-year mourning period ended and the tablet was permanently installed, palace women could no longer participate in the ritual processions. The rituals for all previous kings followed this same pattern.

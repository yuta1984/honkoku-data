《Marginal note: Children of Naha only receive stipends when they serve up to the rank of Treasury Official; below this rank they all receive no stipends》

The above are the numbers of stipends and salaries for officials of the Chinese quarter (Tang camp) in Kumemura.

Intelligence officials and below, both high and low-ranking officials who have merit, pass down hereditary stipends and fiefs to their descendants, all with differences made according to merit assessment.

Agricultural Land

All agricultural land is cultivated and planted in the ninth and tenth months, with harvest completed in the fifth month. For the fiefs granted to each official, they personally go to their lands to oversee cultivation and harvest, with officials or their sons supervising. In the tenth and eleventh months, green seedlings all emerge from the water, and seedlings are divided and transplanted. During the time of heavy rains, thunder develops and earthworms sing; the climate is like spring. When north winds blow intermittently, they are not severely cold. In late November, one Additional Courtier is dispatched for inspection, and two Attendant Scribes patrol the villages separately to encourage agriculture, returning only after more than a month. In the sixth month, great hurricanes frequently occur, with sea rains flying horizontally causing all fruits to fall—this is an annual constant. If harvest is not completed early, there will surely be much suffering from uprooted crops. Therefore, in this country they plow in autumn, sow in winter, weed in spring, and harvest in summer—firstly to take advantage of rain and moisture, and secondly to avoid the harm of typhoons and hurricanes. Though the year-round warmth would logically allow for double cropping, the reason fields all lie fallow after the sixth month is this.

Calendar

For the calendar, they follow the orthodox calendar system. When tribute envoys reach the capital, they must wait for the distribution of calendars on the first day of the tenth month before returning with them. By the time they reach the country, more than half a year has already passed. Therefore, the people of the country establish Calendar Interpreter Officials with official rank of seventh grade to calculate, create calendars, and put them to use. The calendar face is inscribed: "The Calendar Official of the Ryukyu Kingdom respectfully follows imperial instructions and hereby creates and selects."

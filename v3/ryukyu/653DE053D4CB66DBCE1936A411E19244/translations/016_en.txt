Now, having obtained the general outline of the rank system from Grand Master Cai Wen, Grand Master Cheng Shunze presented the official system. His memorial states: "The Kingdom of Chuzan has established offices and divided responsibilities for quite some time. Respectfully encountering the broad dissemination of the Sacred Son of Heaven's teachings, our kingdom's official ranks dare not fail to look up and comply. Therefore, referencing the original titles, we have initially established rank hierarchies, arranged official positions according to merit, determined the size of all ministerial positions based on qualifications, and uniformly established caps, hairpins, and clothing colors as unchangeable standards. In terms of names, they are the same yet belong to different ranks; in terms of grades, they differ yet are unified, all conforming to the old system and harmonizing with proper pronunciation. The ranking system truly serves to honor the king." The document lists items clearly and systematically, presenting an orderly and admirable structure. However, in establishing a nation and creating offices, both civil and military should be equally emphasized. Currently, aside from the Ceremonial Guard and Military Preparation departments, military positions are too briefly described, and military systems and weaponry are not detailed. This should await future continued research and completion.

Court Dress and Regalia
The king wears a black gauze cap with side wings, gold-plated red tassels, dragon-head golden hairpin, and python robe, with a belt using rhinoceros horn and white jade, all following the clothing system bestowed by the former Ming Dynasty. The queen uses phoenix-head golden hairpins, and palace ladies are also divided into five ranks, numbering about one hundred. The hairpins of noble ladies all correspond to their husbands' rank levels.

From the first rank downward, there are eight grades of caps, four grades of hairpins, and four grades of belts, detailed as follows:

Senior First Rank: Golden hairpin, brocade cap with colored weaving, brocade belt, green robe
Junior First Rank: (Similar to above)

Senior Second Rank: Golden hairpin
Junior Second Rank: Golden flower with silver column hairpin, purple silk cap (those with merit are granted silk brocade caps), dragon-coiled yellow belt (those with merit are granted brocade belts), deep blue robe (court dress remains the same down to the eighth and ninth ranks)

Senior Third Rank: Silver hairpin, yellow silk cap, dragon-coiled yellow belt
Junior Third Rank: (Similar to above)

Previous Royal Queens
The previous envoy Wang Ji's "Chuzan Enkaku-shi" (History of Chuzan) had some disorder in the sequence of the front diagram, so now I have researched and corrected it.
All kings are called "Shinshu" (spirit tablets), but only the four kings Nei, Ho, Ken, and Shitsu are called "Sonrei" (honored spirits), and their courtesy names are also added in their designation.
Nei is called "Koō," Ho is called "Sōsei," Ken is called "Shūei," and Shitsu is called "Chokō."

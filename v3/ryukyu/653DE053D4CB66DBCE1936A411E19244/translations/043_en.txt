months, the king observes ritual purification and conducts sacrificial ceremonies to the mountain and sea deities as well as the protective deities of the nation, or dispatches officials to perform the rituals. The deity of Ben-dake is named Noro-noro, who is the second daughter of the Tenson clan. The sacred walls surround the area on all four sides, with dense groves of trees clustered together, and a small gate that blocks entry, facing south. Outside the gate are two wooden pavilions, with small stone pagodas and stone lamp stands on the left side, five on each side. Upon entering the gate, stone steps turn north then east, ascending several dozen levels to reach the summit where there is nothing but a stone furnace with dozens of incense sticks burning—this is the place for worshipping the main mountain deity. The flat ground in front of the wooden pavilions is square and spacious, facing south with a view of the sea. In the southeastern direction is one stone furnace where incense is burned to worship the sea deity. Throughout the country, wherever there are dense groves surrounded by low walls with small gates and barriers inside, these are all called "dake" (peaks), similar to the earth gods of China—every village has them.

【Sugen-ji Temple (Former Kings' Ancestral Shrine)】Spring and autumn sacrifices are conducted either by the king personally or by dispatched officials. After three days of ritual purification, music consists entirely of Tenson Taihei songs that sing of ancestral virtues and the enduring spiritual legacy passed down through generations.

【Enkaku-ji Temple】The main sect maintains incense offerings with seasonal festivals and monthly festivals《Marginal note: Called Urabon Festival》. After three days of ritual purification, there are special ceremonies on death anniversaries, and tea offerings on the new and full moon days. The rituals at Tenno-ji and Tenkai-ji temples follow the same protocol.

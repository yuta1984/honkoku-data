In the central bay of the Buddha hall, Buddha is enshrined, and the left and right sides are like side chambers storing the spirit tablets of previous kings who have already been moved to the ancestral shrine. The right gallery in front of the Buddha hall serves as a spirit hall, with two halls arranged in parallel. Each hall has three bays, all facing south. The upper hall has three niches: the center is for Sho-en Ryū-keiun-kun, which is his posthumous name. This is the founding ancestor of the royal line. The left niche is for Sho-shitsu, the great-great-grandfather of the current king. The right niche is for Sho-tei, the great-grandfather of the current king. The lower hall has three niches for Sho-shin, who was the son of Sho-en. This is the Taiso (Grand Ancestor) of the royal line. Together with the founding ancestor Sho-en, he is among the perpetually enshrined spirits, so they both occupy central niches. The left niche is for Sho-eki, the father of the current king. The right niche is for Sho-jun, the grandfather of the current king. The reason the father is placed on the left and the grandfather on the right is that the positions follow the zhao-mu order, so there is no concern about equal honor.

Tennō-ji Temple also has spirit tablets. The Buddha hall faces south with three bays: Buddha is enshrined in the center, and in the left bay are two spirit tablets. One reads "귀진 Sho-shoku Spirit Position," who was the father of founding ancestor Sho-en. The other reads "Guizhen Sho-kyū Spirit Position." Sho-kyū was the father of King Sho-hō and the third son of Sho-gen. Both were fathers of kings but never became kings themselves, so they are separately enshrined here. The two tablets beside them are for queen consorts. The four tablets in the right bay are all for queen consorts.

Within Tenkai-ji Temple is the spirit tablet of Sho-gi, who was the father of King Sho-nei. The temple is entirely for female spirits, enshrining queen consorts and royal sisters who married out and established family shrines.

When Crown Prince Sho-eki died, after the initial burial, his spirit tablet was placed in the Crown Prince's residence, where male and female officials wore mourning clothes and performed daily ritual crying for one hundred days. After that, the tablet was moved to Tenkai-ji Temple, where men and women also performed daily incense and silk offerings. After the three-year mourning period ended and the permanent enshrinement was completed, palace women could no longer participate in the ritual ceremonies. The rites for all previous kings followed this same pattern.

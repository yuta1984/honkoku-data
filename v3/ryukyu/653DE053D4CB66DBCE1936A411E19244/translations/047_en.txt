[Confucian Temple] Spring and Autumn Sacrifices: In the first month of the 58th year of Kangxi, Purple-Gold Counselor Tei Junsoku petitioned to use the grand sacrifice (tairo) for worshipping Confucius and the lesser sacrifice (shōrō) for worshipping Duke Qisheng. The numbers of ritual cups, silk offerings, grain offerings, and ritual vessels are all depicted in detail in the diagram. For sacrificial items not available in this country, local products were used as substitutes. Three days before the sacrifice, all participants observe ritual purification. One day before, they rehearse the ceremony and inspect the sacrificial animals. On the designated day, the king dispatches a Purple-Gold Counselor to sacrifice at the Qisheng Shrine at the hour of the Ox, and dispatches a Legal Affairs official to sacrifice at the Confucian Temple at the hour of the Tiger. All perform the ritual of three kneelings and nine prostrations, and the ceremonies of drinking blessed wine and receiving blessed meat. This ritual was first performed in the second month of that year. Previously, Purple-Gold Counselors or Chief Historian officials served as chief celebrants, performing eight prostrations without the drinking of blessed wine and receiving of blessed meat ceremonies, only burning paper money without using silk, and without purification and animal inspection rituals, which seemed too simple, so they petitioned for the current proper ceremonial form.

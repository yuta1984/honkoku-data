For minor affairs, those who have not yet entered service handle them. Those who do enter service are granted land and made chikutōshi-pechin, gradually promoted until they reach sashi-kikan (inspector-recorder).
　This is the beginning of commoner children entering government service.

The children of hereditary officials are called "satono-shi," which means "young lords." The local name is sashido-nushi《Marginal note: In local pronunciation, the two characters sashido are read like the character "sato," the character "nu" like "no," and the character "shi" like "ko"》. The younger ones become nai-shi▢-rō, named "satono-shi kuchi-kyū nai-yaku," serving closely as attendants. When they pass fifteen years of age and reach eighteen, they shave the hair on top of their heads and change to small topknots. Then they no longer enter the inner palace, are granted land, and become satono-shi-pechin, gradually rising to become oya-kata.
　This is the beginning of bureaucratic families' children entering government service.

Kume village consists entirely of the thirty-six surname families who were granted registration from Fujian. Among their outstanding children, three or four aged fifteen or sixteen are selected to become scholars (shusai). The thirteen or fourteen who do not qualify for selection are called "young scholars" (waka-shusai) and study books and characters. These scholars are tested every year in the twelfth month, given topics from the Four Books to compose a poem of either eight or four lines. Those who are capable have their names recorded and are promoted to assistant interpreters (fuku-tsūji). From there they gradually advance to Purple-Gold Grand Master《Marginal note: Purple-Gold Grand Master is also called oya-kata》.

Clans
The four great surnames of Shuri are Shō, Ō, Mō, and Ba. The Shō clan is a branch family of the royal Shō surname, but being somewhat
distant, they are called Shō to distinguish them. Therefore, they do not intermarry with the royal family through the generations. Among the native
people who have marriage relations with the royal family, only the three families Ō, Mō, and Ba serve as royal uncles and Hōshi through generations. Currently
there are three people serving as Hōshi: Ba Kenzu, Ō Jidō, Shō Sei[■]koku-jō, and Mō Hōshū
《Marginal note: Maternal grandfather of the current king Shō Kei, the queen consort is from the Ba clan》. The genealogies are all unclear, so investigation will continue to compile family records.

The thirty-six surnames of Kume were all Min people (Fujian people) granted during the Hongwu and Yongle reigns, but by the Wanli period, those surviving
were only the five surnames Sai, Tei, Ryō, Kin, and Rin. Those additionally granted in the thirty-fifth year of Wanli were the two
surnames Gen and Mō. The descendants of each surname have not all multiplied greatly. Many others have established themselves through registration and achieved noble prominence,

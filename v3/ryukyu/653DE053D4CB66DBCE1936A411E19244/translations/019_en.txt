片帽 (Side cap)
All side caps are made of black silk, covering the top of the head with a brim below forming six ridges. These are caps worn at home during cold weather, and are worn by medical officials, musicians, and those who serve tea and pour water in the royal palace who have shaved their hair like monks.

笠 (Hats)
Most hats are made from wheat stalks, though there are also leather hats with black lacquer applied to the outside and vermillion on the inside.

短簪 (Short hairpins)
Short hairpins are about three to four sun in length, worn by those who already wear caps and have removed the hair from the top of their heads. The decorative heads are cylindrical, with some being square or hexagonal columns. Gold is most precious, followed by gold heads with silver shafts, then silver, with copper being the lowest grade.

長簪 (Long hairpins)
Long hairpins are over one shaku in length, worn by women and young children who wear large topknots. These are also classified into three grades of gold and silver to distinguish social status. Hairpins of common women are all made of tortoiseshell.

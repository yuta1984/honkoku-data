Selection of Officials
Within the kingdom, those who enter government service are only people from the four villages of Shuri, Tomari, Naha, and Kume. All others are village households. Among them, those who have some understanding of the national script become village chiefs called "sadame" 《Marginal note: local name is yamahakki》, receive official documents, and dispatch villagers for corvée labor. Next are village heads called "sajisha" 《Marginal note: local name is yamahekiko》, all of whom serve in lower positions, wear blue-green caps, and remain in these positions for life without promotion.
The people of the three villages of Shuri, Tomari, and Naha are called "jin'ya." The children of officials who have not yet entered service are called "shi." These "shi" shave the tops of their heads, and when promoted to chikutōshi, they become tōshi-rō (junior officials). Next, those named chikutōshi-za become tōshi-sa-rō (assistant junior officials). There are also those named "ōhitsusha," "fukuhitsusha," and "taikan-hitsusha," which are like China's secretarial clerks (hitsuteishiki). There are also those named "wakahitsusha," which are like China's official students (kansei), who assist with major affairs of villages and counties.

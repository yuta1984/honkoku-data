There are bananas, sugar cane, pomegranates, oranges, and persimmons, but no plums, peaches, or similar fruits. Among grasses and flowers, there are many tiger lilies, hibiscus, wind orchids, orange jasmine, Nago chrysanthemums, chestnut chrysanthemums, flowering plants, and marsh wisteria. Recently, tobacco has been cultivated.

Among trees, there is red wood, which is hard and dense in nature, purple-red in color with white grain. It is a type of palm wood (commonly called kashi wood). Black wood is what the official records call "bird wood." There are also what Su Tie called phoenix-tail banana, elm (commonly called katsumaru), osmanthus (commonly called kiiha), sandalwood, and fortune tree (called dego, yarafu, and mane - all local names whose details are unclear). The Sui History mentions the "fighting tower tree," but the "Record of Missions to Ryukyu" states that this tree is not a local product, and even today the people of the country say they are not familiar with it.

Among birds, there are turtle doves and black quail, including those of unusual colors (commonly called mino-utsura). Bats from Yaeyama are extremely large in form. Other wild birds are present, but there are no cranes or jungle fowl, and wild geese do not come. During autumn months, many hawks, falcons, and small sparrows come from the south.

For livestock, there are horses, cattle, dogs, and pigs; for wild animals, there are deer and others - nothing is lacking, but there are no tigers, leopards, rhinoceros, or elephants. They also produce cats of unusual colors. Among insects, snakes and scorpions are most numerous, with about seven types of venomous snakes. Scorpions can also sting people. Those that dwell in wall crevices and make noise like sparrows, and red soldiers that come from the south during the transition between spring and summer, are also numerous.

Among scaled and shelled creatures, there are white fish from the sea, also called sea horses, with horse heads and fish bodies, thick blue skin, and meat like deer, which people commonly eat. Horse dragons, lobsters, and similar creatures are also all present.

[Marginal note] Cattle refers to water buffalo.

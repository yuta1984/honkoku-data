Among the flowers are plum, peach, apricot, osmanthus, magnolia, lotus magnolia, cotton rose, red cherry, snowball, camellia, pomegranate, and azalea. 《Azaleas bloom from the tenth month until the third month. The flowers are extremely large, four times larger than those produced in China》 Hibiscus 《The double-flowered variety comes in two colors: deep red and light red. The single-flowered variety has one type of deep red, with central stamens protruding about one sun beyond the petals, shaped like a candle holder. It is also called shōden-kō (illuminating palace red). It flowers in all four seasons, with peak blooming in the sixth month》 Tiger lily 《Compared to those in China, they are particularly large, some growing into trees over one jō in length. Red flowers burst forth in dozens of clusters in all directions like fire. There are also thousand-petaled varieties, with layered flower stages that are extremely beautiful》

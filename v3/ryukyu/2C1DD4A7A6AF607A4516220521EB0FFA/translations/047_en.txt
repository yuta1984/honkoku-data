Swimming crab《Japanese name: Te-naga-gani, Barbarian name: Zēkaratsuhe》

The sea urchin has spines growing on its back like a hedgehog, moves slowly and steadily in a wriggling manner. Its taste is like that of shrimp and swimming crabs《The illustration is shown earlier》

The snail family is particularly unusual, brilliantly colored in five hues with strangely varied forms. The giant conch is as large as a plate, and the people of this country use it beneficially as door hinges and as cooking pots - all of these uses. Among the unusual ones are the gecko fish and others.
The gecko fish grows five or six claws on top of its shell, shaped like a gecko, and is thus named gecko fish.

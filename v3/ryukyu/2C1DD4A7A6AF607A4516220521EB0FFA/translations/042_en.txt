Among insects, there are mouse-bats and gecko lizards that can make sounds like sparrows, and this is true in winter as well.
Lizards live in water ponds, have red bellies and golden light on their backs. There are also small blue snakes with four legs that are commonly seen. The most venomous snakes in the country appear every September and harm people, causing them to die standing up. (The previous envoy's record says that these snakes do not harm people, but this is unconfirmed.) Mosquitoes and flies all emerge in winter.
Ants are the same as those in China, but their abdomens are transparent like crystal, and when killed, they contain water droplets.

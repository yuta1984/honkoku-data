Among the scaled fish, there are sharks, carp, crucian carp, eels, sculpins, shrimp, goldfish, and silver thread fish. Among the exotic species, there are hair fish, needlefish, flying fish, etc. Their green, red, green scales, and red patterns intermingle in five colors, some round, some long - too numerous to count. The local people call them according to their color and shape, but they all have no [formal] names. When sea fish are cut raw into pieces and viewed in dark places at night, they all shine transparently with green firelight, the color like that of the night-glowing wood of Rehe.

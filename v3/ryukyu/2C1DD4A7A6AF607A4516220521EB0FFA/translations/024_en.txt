Perpetual spring rose 《Japanese name is shikizakibara (four-season blooming rose)》

Nago orchid: The leaves are short and thick, same as cinnamon leaves, size barely like a finger. It blooms in the third and fourth months, no different from orchids. Eight or nine clusters on one stem bloom together. The fragrance is clear and surpasses that of orchids. It grows among the rocks of Mount Nago without needing water or soil. Sometimes it grows parasitically on tree branches, or is wrapped in palm bark and hung. There is also the wind orchid, whose leaves are longer than orchids, with a fragrance like galangal and fennel. Split bamboo is used as a pot, hung in front of the wind. It propagates extremely easily. Common people all value orchids and call them "Confucius flowers."

Large-leaf Nago orchid 《Also called Iriomote orchid. According to examination, what the Tentai Hōgai-shi calls "immortal's fingernail orchid" is probably this very plant》

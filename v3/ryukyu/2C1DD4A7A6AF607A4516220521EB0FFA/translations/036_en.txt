Among beasts, there are cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, dogs, cats, deer, monkeys, and wild boars. (The Ming Dynasty's Yitongzhi states that local products include bears, leopards, and wolves, but upon current examination, none of these exist.)

Among livestock, there are chickens, ducks, and geese. Among exotic livestock, there is the Taihe chicken, which is particularly small compared to ordinary chickens, with short legs and a long tail. This breed comes from the Seven Islands.

Among birds, there are sparrows, birds, pigeons, herons, gulls, wild ducks, bulbuls, turtle doves, streptopelia (which come in the twelfth month), wild doves, quails, shrikes (commonly called "divine birds"), field birds, pheasants, wagtails, cuckoos, and mandarin ducks. Swallows come in the seventh month but do not nest in human dwellings. Hawks come from outer islands with northeast winds in the middle of the ninth month. Geese are occasionally present but do not arrive regularly. Cranes sometimes appear, but it is rare to see them. Among exotic birds, there are koharu and others.

[The soybeans] are particularly small, like fine black beans. Among unique products is the sweet potato (bansho), which is found everywhere.

Households cultivate several dozen banana plants, extracting fibers to weave banana cloth (bashofu). Men and women all wear this for winter clothing, and it provides benefits similar to sericulture. The old records of Ming dynasty investiture envoys Xiao Chongye and Xia Ziyang state that "cotton is not planted, and the land is not suitable for tea," but nowadays these can occasionally be found, though they are not cultivated very extensively.

(Note: The Ryukyu region has no Japanese pepper [sansho], and even if planted, it is difficult to cultivate)

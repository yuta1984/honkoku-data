The old records say: cast a wooden piece from the bow into the sea, a person runs swiftly to the stern, and when the person and wooden piece arrive simultaneously, this is called "matching the watch." If the person's movement is ahead of the wooden piece, it is "insufficient watch," and if the person's movement is behind the wooden piece, it is "excessive watch." Now, Western ships use glass hourglasses to determine watches, which is simple and easy to understand. Two glass bottles with narrow necks and large bellies - one is filled with sand, the two openings are placed top and bottom opposite each other with a line connecting them to allow the sand to pass through. Suspended above the compass, when the sand finishes passing through it becomes one "leak," then it is immediately inverted and suspended again. Calculating one day and night yields approximately twenty-four leaks, and each watch of sixty li by ship takes approximately two and a half leaks. When a person's movement is ahead of the wooden piece resulting in "insufficient watch," this means the wind is calm and the ship's progress is slow - even when the hourglass time is reached, sixty li has not yet been covered, hence "insufficient watch." When a person's movement is behind the wooden piece resulting in "excessive watch," this means the wind is strong and the ship's progress is fast - when the hourglass time is reached, it has already exceeded sixty li, hence "excessive watch."

[Marginal note: Minister] Baoguang observes that investiture ships travel to Ryukyu after the summer solstice riding the southwest winds, and return to Fuzhou after the winter solstice riding the northeast winds. This describes the general pattern. Southern winds are gentle and moderate while northern winds are harsh and severe, therefore the return journey is especially difficult. This is not merely due to favorable or adverse water currents. The Jiajing and Wanli period investiture ships returning to Fujian generally departed before the winter solstice, during the 9th and 10th months when the north winds were not yet strong. The most suitable time for the return voyage is the 11th and 12th months. Around the winter solstice the wind force increases daily, and waves will inevitably pass over the ship. In the first month [of the new year], hurricanes are most frequent, and moreover [the timing] does not accord with the proper schedule

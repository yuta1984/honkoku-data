days

Ninth month, 9th day (Note: Double Yang Storm), 16th day (Note: Zhang Liang Hurricane), 19th day (Note: Guanyin Hurricane), 27th day (Note: Cold Wind Storm)

Also, the 11th, 15th, and 19th days of the ninth month are all days when the Dragon God pays court to the Jade Emperor.

Tenth month, 5th day (Note: Wind Signal Storm), 10th day (Note: Water Immortal King Hurricane), 20th day (Note: Eastern Sacred Mountain's Court to Heaven), 26th day (Note: Old Father Hurricane)

Also, the 8th, 15th, and 27th days of the tenth month are all days when the Eastern Magistrate pays court to the Jade Emperor.

Eleventh month, 14th day (Note: Water Earl Storm), 27th day (Note: Pu'an Hurricane), 29th day (Note: Western Sacred Mountain's Court to Heaven)

Twelfth month, 24th day (Note: Seeing Off the Gods Hurricane, also called Dust-Sweeping Wind)

Generally, when encountering wind and storm dates, if they do not occur on the designated day, they will fall within three days before or after. Also, the four lunar mansions Ji, Bi, Yi, and Zhen likewise govern the rising of winds, so all should be carefully avoided.

The "Wind Signal Investigation" section up to this point is all recorded in the "Comprehensive Guide for Navigation." Some content is taken from taboo and divination books, while other parts come from records of sea captains and helmsmen. Though the language is not entirely refined and elegant, much of it has proven accurate upon verification. I append this now to inform future generations.

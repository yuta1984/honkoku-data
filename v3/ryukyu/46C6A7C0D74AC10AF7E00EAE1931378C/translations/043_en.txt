The divine manifestations of Fuqti Wanzhengse reached the imperial ear, leading to additional honorific titles and sacrificial rites. The divine spirit remains clearly manifest and increasingly brilliant to this day, and all who cross the seas must carry the principal deity aboard their ships. In previous years, when investing the Ryukyu kingdom, imperial edicts and sacrifices were conducted twice, with prayers in summer and reports in winter. All texts were prepared in advance and proclaimed by envoys, resulting in safe passage. This was due to the influence of sagely virtue, with divine responses being particularly manifest.

　　Miraculous Rescues by the Investiture Ships 《Marginal note: Only the miraculous rescue at Chaishan in the first year of Hongxi is recorded in detail in the Sacred Records; the following cannot be verified, so we begin from Chen Kan》

In the thirteenth year of Jiajing, when investiture envoys Chen Kan of the Bureau of Scrutiny 《Marginal note: Since Chen Kan was the first to keep records, we begin from Chen Kan》 and Gao Cheng of the Ministry of Personnel reached Gumei Mountain, their ship developed a leak. Through prayer, they managed to seal it and proceed safely. On the return journey, they encountered a hurricane that broke all their masts. Suddenly, a red light illuminated the ship, whereupon they cast divination blocks and raised the rudder. Butterflies and sparrows also appeared as omens. That evening, when the wind became violent, they donned ceremonial robes to pray and vowed to erect a stele, whereupon the wind subsided. They then requested inclusion in the spring and autumn sacrificial ceremonies.

In the fortieth year of Jiajing, when investiture envoys Guo Rulin and Li Jichun reached Red Island, there was no wind and large fish disturbed their ship. They performed offerings of the Golden Light Sutra and used colorful boats to carry it, whereupon they obtained southern winds and proceeded safely. On the day of their return to Fujian, as a hurricane was about to break, there was first the omen of two sparrows alighting on the ship. In a moment the hurricane struck and they lost their rudder, but when Guo and others composed a written prayer, the wind calmed and they were able to replace the rudder. Additionally, a bird perched on the mast and would not leave.

In the seventh year of Wanli, investiture envoys Xiao Chongye of the Bureau of Scrutiny and Xie Ran of the Ministry of Personnel lost their way when their compass course went wrong, and they also lost their rudder blade. While offering fervent prayers, suddenly a swallow and a dragonfly flew around the left and right sides of the ship. They were then able to replace the rudder and the ship became safe.

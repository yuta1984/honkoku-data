The imperial edict was issued in accordance with the proposal.

Subject Baoguang notes that according to the Record of Yuan History, during the Zhiyuan era, due to miraculous responses in protecting maritime transport, additional divine titles were conferred upon Tianfei, accumulating to ten characters. The temple was called Lingci, and there were temples in Zhigu, Pingjiang, Zhoujing, Quan, Fu, Xinghua and other places. Since the Huangqing era, envoys have been dispatched annually carrying incense to perform sacrifices everywhere, with one set of golden banners and one silver ingot provided to the Pingjiang Official Transport Office and local government offices, using fine wool and wine libations, conducting ceremonies in informal dress. The prayer text stated: "On this year, month, and day, the Emperor specially dispatches certain officials to offer sacrifices to the Nation-Protecting, People-Sheltering, Widely Beneficent, Blessing-Bestowing, Clearly Manifest Tianfei." Thus seasonal sacrifices had already existed since the Yuan dynasty. In the Jiajing era of the former Ming, the investiture envoy Chen Kan returned from his mission and petitioned to be granted sacrificial rites to repay divine blessings. The Ministry of Rites deliberated and ordered the Provincial Administration Commission to establish one altar for sacrifices, which was approved. This was also a case of conducting special sacrificial ceremonies. In the third year of Wanli, investiture envoy Xiao Chongye first requested ranked sacrifices to sea deities, combining both prayer and thanksgiving sacrifices. Investiture ships going to sea have followed this precedent until today. In the twenty-second year of Kangxi, investiture subject-envoy Wang Ji returned and submitted a memorial requesting that, following the example of mountain and river deities, local officials be made to conduct spring and autumn sacrifices, but although the Ministry of Rites deliberated on this, it was not approved for implementation. Now as we subjects pray for divine protection while at sea, we privately consider that while the honorific titles have already reached their utmost, there was only a deficiency in the sacrificial code, so we specifically raised this as our petition. The divine response was manifest and clear, and now we have indeed received imperial grace and been specially granted approval. The ceremonies are brilliant and glorious in answering divine protection, surpassing all ages.

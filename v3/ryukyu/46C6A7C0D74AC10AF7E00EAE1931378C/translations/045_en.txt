When the current investiture ship set sail, the wind was somewhat easterly, so they prayed and it straightened properly. They frequently used the mao compass bearing, but the ship's hull sank too deeply and nearly fell into dangerous currents. They then prayed devoutly and were able to change to using the yichen compass bearing. Through divination, they were granted that they would see mountains on the twenty-eighth day, and indeed they saw Leaf Wall. The ship traveled over 600 li downstream, but to enter Naha harbor required a northwest wind or they could not reach it. They prayed for this, and it immediately changed, allowing them to reach port in one night. When the ship returned and reached Phoenix Tail Mountain, a whirlwind arose causing both the sail and rudder to tilt, but when they called upon the deity, these were finally corrected. Upon reaching Seven Star Mountain, they anchored below Gorge Mountain, but at the fifth watch a hurricane arose, dragging the anchor and nearly causing them to strike the reef. When they called upon the deity, the ship slowed somewhat and they were finally able to drop anchor. Everyone placed their hands to their foreheads saying, "All this is bestowed by Tianfei."

Imperial Sacrificial Text (Prayer and Thanksgiving, Two Documents)

In the fifty-eighth year of Kangxi, year of jihai, fifth month, first day guiyou, exceeding to the sacrificial day guisi

The Emperor dispatched the principal investiture envoy Hai Bao, Compiler of the Hanlin Academy, and deputy envoy Xu Baoguang, Editor of the Hanlin Academy, to perform investiture of the Ryukyu Kingdom, to offer sacrifice to

the deity, saying: The deity manifests extraordinary power amid wind and waves, displaying spiritual efficacy on the boundless seas. In supporting the endangered and delivering from peril, divine merit is always evident; in warding off troubles and repelling disasters, this truly accords with sacrificial ceremonies. Now, due to the investiture of this distant realm, taking the route across the vast ocean, we command these envoys to reverently conduct the sacrificial ceremony. May you silently protect the waterway so that we may cross safely with smooth currents and successfully fulfill our imperial mandate. This is the deity's blessing. We respectfully announce this.

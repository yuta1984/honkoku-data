vessels were numerous.
When the investiture command was issued, before《side note: retainer｜》and others arrived in Fujian, Provincial Governor Manbao sent directives to various garrisons to select large ships for use, preparing repairs in advance, and all equipment was made ready. The two ships were obtained from Ningbo Prefecture in Zhejiang Province, all civilian merchant vessels. Although they were comparable in size to previous investiture ships, the costs were lighter and preparations swift. This was unprecedented.《side note: According to records, when Xu Jing of Song was sent as envoy to Goryeo, the two divine ships were all granted names by imperial edict｜six guest ships for a total of eight vessels; Ming investiture ships were sometimes one, sometimes two; now two ships》
The No. 1 ship housed the envoys together, while the No. 2 ship carried soldiers and laborers. The No. 1 ship had four holds fore and aft, each hold having three levels upper and lower. The bottom level was filled with ballast stones and stored supplies. The middle level housed the envoys, with both sides called "mali," divided into two levels with eight rooms on the left and right to house attendants. The hold entrance required descending a ladder with two turns to reach the hold interior. The hold interior was about six feet wide, able to accommodate one bed crosswise, eight to nine feet high. Above, holes were made in the deck surface as skylights, well-like openings about three feet square to let in light, immediately covered when it rained. Even in daytime it was black as night. The deck surface left the right side open for ship operations, with several stoves and furnaces placed on the left side. Plank galleries extended one to two feet beyond the gunwales, with awnings encircling fore and aft to create one or two small shelters where people took turns residing to escape the sweltering heat below deck. Water holds and water tanks were established with personnel in charge, markers placed to distribute water, with each person receiving one bowl daily. The empty stern section served as a command platform where flags and banners were erected, rattan shields and bows and arrows were arranged, with soldiers and musicians residing above. Below the command platform was the shrine hall where Tianfei and various water deities were enshrined, with the rudder house below that. In the small cabin before the house, compass equipment was arranged, where the boatswain, helmsman, and chief navigator serving the investiture envoys resided. On both sides of the ship, twelve cannon ports large and small were distributed left and right, with military equipment to match. Nine mat and cloth awnings, three large crossbeams on the deck surface with axles set for rotation and rigging

The Kun directions also each differ. What is now recorded in the "Compass Guide" (Shinan Guangyi) discusses exclusively compass bearings, speaks confusedly about winds, and frequently uses the Mao compass bearing, thus often falling north, not seeing Gumi but seeing Hekibi instead. Later people who cannot see mountains claim this is unreliable, and those in charge of the tribute ships insist on the Mao compass bearing. One should deeply study the two records of Xia and Wang, consider the winds and use Chen-Xun and other compass bearings in combination, lifting the ship's position to ensure it does not fall to Hekibi.

Historically, when imperial ships crossed the sea, military personnel all carried pressed money and goods to trade. This old practice dates back to the Wanli 7th year (1579) when envoy Xie of Changle wrote "Record of Eastern Trade," which included a provision for military welfare. Since the Hongwu period, five hundred men crossing the sea were permitted one hundred jin of luggage each to trade with Ryukyu people, established as regulation. In the jiawu mission, ten thousand gold was obtained - five hundred men each got twenty gold, the most got thirty to forty gold, the least got ten to eight gold. In the xinyou mission, only six thousand gold was obtained - five hundred men each got twelve gold, the most got twenty gold, the least got five to six gold, somewhat disappointing. Therefore, in the jimao recruitment, only mediocre craftsmen were obtained for service, unable to match previous skill levels. Only three thousand-odd gold was obtained - eight gold per person, the most got fifteen to sixteen gold, the least got three to four gold, greatly disappointing>>

On the 20th day, Mizunoe-Tatsu (壬辰), we received the imperial edict and boarded the ship. For several days, the night winds had been coming from the northeast, but on this day they turned to the southwest. Therefore, at the beginning of the Wei hour (1-3 PM), we raised anchor and proceeded to Yishan Temple to perform ritual prayers to the sea god.

On the 21st day, Mizunoto-Mi (癸巳), at sunrise there was a southwest wind. At midday we reached Guantou and exited through Jinpai Gate. At sunset we had not yet passed Huangxia Point, so we dropped anchor.

On the 22nd day, Kinoe-Uma (甲午), at sunrise with a Ding-Wei wind, we passed Meihua Head. At midday, with a Ding wind bearing toward Wu, we rode the tide out through Wuhu Gate into the open ocean, passing Guantang Tail. At sunset we reached Jinshi Gate, and at the ninth night watch the wind turned to Ding-Wei. The investiture accompanying minister, Grand Master of Remonstrance Chen Qixiang, led his country's group leaders and navigators to receive us, using the Yi-Chen compass bearing for three and a half watches.

On the 23rd day, Kinoto-Hitsuji (乙未), at sunrise we saw Dongyong behind our ship, approximately one and a half watches distant. With a Ding-Wei wind, using the Yi-Mao compass bearing for two watches, we were approximately eight and a half watches distant from Guantang.

On the 24th day, Hinoe-Saru (丙申), at sunrise with a Ding-Wu wind, we continued using the Yi-Mao compass bearing. Before midday we passed Rice Bran Ocean (where the sea water is crystal clear blue like indigo, with fine yellow sand like saliva foam stretching across the water surface like rice bran). We saw schools of fish paying homage to the water. As the sun was about to set, two large birds came and perched on our mast. That night the wind became increasingly favorable, using the Yi-Mao compass bearing for four watches. In total, thirteen and a half watches should have allowed us to see Jilong Mountain, Flower Vase, Cotton Flower and other islets, as well as Pengjia Mountain, but none were visible. During the night, using the Yi-Mao compass bearing for four and a half watches, totaling seventeen watches of sailing, we drifted northeast about one and a half watches.

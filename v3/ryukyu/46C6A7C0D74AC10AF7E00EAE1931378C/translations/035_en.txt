refreshing, and there is absolutely no reason to launch a ship. In the second month there are many fogs and dragons emerge from the sea. However, spring winds are gentle and moderate. In this mission I personally verified that waves do not pass over the ship, which seems far superior to the period around the winter solstice. Experienced old ship captains say "Being carried by east winds after the 20th day of the 10th month is auspicious." While Baoguang was in Ryukyu, he observed wind directions daily, and after examining several months, found that winds coming from the east without interruption occur only during the half-month period from after the 20th day of the 10th month to before the 5th day of the 11th month. Therefore, examining [records] since Chen Kan, only Xiao Chongye's return to Fujian was relatively safe and auspicious, and his departure date of the 24th day of the 10th month was indeed accurate. I append this to inform those who come after.

Wind Patterns

After Qingming, earth energy moves from south to north, so south winds are normal. After frost descent, earth energy moves from south to north, so north winds are normal. If this reverses its normal pattern, then typhoons and hurricanes will occur. Those with great and violent winds are called hurricanes (ju), and those even more severe are called typhoons (tai). Hurricanes usually strike suddenly, while typhoons develop gradually. Hurricanes may burst forth instantaneously and stop abruptly, while typhoons continue for consecutive days and nights, or several days without stopping. Generally speaking, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th months have hurricanes; the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th months have typhoons. In the 9th month, north winds first become violent and may continue for consecutive months - commonly called "ninth month descending winds." Occasionally there are typhoons that arrive suddenly like spring typhoons. When ships encounter hurricanes in the open ocean, they can still manage, but when they encounter typhoons, they cannot withstand them. After the 10th month, north winds regularly occur, but typhoons and hurricanes have no fixed schedule, so sailors watch for gaps in the wind to travel. The 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th months should belong to south winds, but when typhoons are about to develop, north winds arrive first, then shift to southeast, then shift to south, then again...

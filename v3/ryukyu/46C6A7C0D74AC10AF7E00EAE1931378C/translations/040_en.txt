Record of the Divine Manifestations of Tianfei

Tianfei was a daughter of the Lin family from Meizhou Island in Putian 《Marginal note: According to Zhang Xueli's record, Tianfei was a daughter of the Cai family from Houyu Island, but this is incorrect》. Her father was named Yuan 《Marginal note: His courtesy name was Weique, her mother was from the Wang family. According to one account, she was the sixth daughter of Lin Fu》, who served as Capital Patrol Inspector in the early Song dynasty. The goddess was born with divine spiritual powers. When she was young, while looking into a well with a group of girls, a deity appeared holding a bronze talisman and bestowed it upon her. The other girls fled in terror. From that time on, she frequently manifested supernatural phenomena and would always cross the sea riding on a single mat, so people all called her the "Wise and Miraculous Lady."

One day, while weaving, she suddenly leaned against her loom, closed her eyes and sat motionless, her complexion changing dramatically. Her mother kicked her to wake her up and questioned her. Upon awakening, she wept and said, "Father is safe, but elder brother has died." Shortly after, news arrived that when her father and brother were crossing the sea, their boat capsized, but her father avoided drowning as if something was supporting him, while her brother fell into the sea and died when the rudder broke. In the fourth year of Yongxi, she ascended to heaven at Meizhou Island 《Marginal note: According to Zhang Xueli's record, she died by throwing herself into the sea to save her father, but this is incorrect. According to one account, the goddess was born on the twenty-third day of the third month in the first year of Jianlong, year geng-shen》.

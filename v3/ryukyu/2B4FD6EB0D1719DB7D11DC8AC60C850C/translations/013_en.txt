However, in the first year of Ansei (1854), when Perry proposed to conclude a treaty with the status of an independent nation, the people of Ryukyu initially refused this, saying it would violate their duty as subjects to the Qing, but when they eventually signed the treaty, they used the Xianfeng era name. Consequently, Western nations also harbored great doubts. In the first place, according to the general principles among all nations, how could there be any reason for one country to belong to two nations? Now that His Majesty personally conducts government, rectifies nomenclature, clarifies national prestige, appoints feudal lords, bestows gifts and currency, and provides preferential treatment and comfort, he will make the former territories of the southern islands once again completely return to the imperial realm and territory. A country like that will also gradually bask in imperial grace, submit to a nation of the same spirit, and eventually cease to willingly accept feudal investiture from foreign countries. Now, from Perry's account of his journey to Ryukyu, I extract and translate various opinions in abbreviated form, and without hesitation about staleness, present them below.

Since the people of the country are naturally simple and honest, they were greatly moved to tears by the grace of the Imperial Court, and matters like last year's investiture discussion were resolved quickly, it is said.

However, where public opinion converges is that the country has an independent system of its own, completely belongs to Japan, and also nominally submits as a vassal to China. The tribute sent annually to China appears to follow established rules, but Ryukyu's officials are not Chinese, and although there are those who understand Chinese writing and language, the commonly used language is naturally different. Nevertheless, an official from Naha once told Perry: "Since the Ming dynasty, our country's inclusion among China's outer tributary states has been something our country takes great pride and honor in. The Chinese Emperor has granted ranks and titles to our king for many years. Our country also carefully gathers local products to present to him. Our countrymen live in China and deal in silk, silk fabrics, refined medicines, and other national

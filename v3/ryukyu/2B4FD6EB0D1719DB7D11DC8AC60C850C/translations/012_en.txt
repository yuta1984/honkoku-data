However, the winds and tides at sea are treacherous with many dangers, and moreover, since Chinese ships are fragile, they always encounter difficulties from wind and waves. Those who receive the appointment as Ryukyu investiture envoys are said to face it with the expectation of death.

　　National Status

The Ryukyu Kingdom was, in ancient times, a country that submitted to our realm as an internal dependency. In the medieval period, communication was severed, but from the beginning of the Ashikaga period, it sent envoys to Ming, again belonged to our country, and eventually became a country with dual allegiance. From the Keichō era onward, it completely became a vassal of the Shimazu clan, yet continued to send envoys to Ming without cease. The Tokugawa did not control the Shimazu clan but left them alone, and even entrusted that country to seek trade with Ming. In terms of national prestige and righteous principles, there are significant shortcomings. Moreover, regarding its treatment, though already a vassal state, it also maintains the appearance of a foreign country. When that country pays tribute to our realm, it follows our calendar, and when it sends envoys to the other country, it uses their era names. <<Marginal note: When Korea sends envoys to our country, they write only the sexagenary cycle, while domestically they use their era names>> Furthermore, toward our country, it does not conceal matters concerning the other country, but toward the other country, it greatly conceals matters concerning our country, acting as if Japan does not exist at all. <<Marginal note: It is established that when ships from the mainland are in Ryukyu and encounter Chinese ships, they must hide>> <<Marginal note: it is said>> Moreover, in domestic affairs and relations with various foreign countries, they all use the other country's calendar and call themselves an independent tributary state of the Qing. Examining the actual situation, on one hand they are ashamed of the name of being our vassal and take pride in the name of being an independent tributary state of the other country, and on the other hand, since the country is poor and small, it is solely to obtain the profits of trade to suffice for national expenses. Since they already fear losing this, they cannot help but be cautious. This is also pitiable. That the Shimazu clan initially did not control them may also have been based on compassion and profit. However, while that country sends tribute only once a year, our country's comings and goings are as frequent as weaving. Their livelihood depends entirely on our country alone. Yet

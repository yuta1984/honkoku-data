[Marginal note] The annual tribute rice that Ryukyu paid to Satsuma was less than a mere 2,000 koku, while conversely Satsuma sent 30,000 koku each year to Ryukyu.
[Marginal note] Traditionally, because that country was poor and small, it had no choice but to borrow from Satsuma, which lent at high interest rates. The accumulated principal and interest over the years became enormous, and most of the annual produce was confiscated for repayment. However, since the Meiji Restoration, both principal and interest have been cancelled, for which they are said to be greatly grateful.

...extremely expensive. Each tributary island has only public and private fields, where supervisory officials collect taxes and send them to the royal government. Annual rent is generally six-tenths regular tax, two-tenths miscellaneous taxes, with only two-tenths barely going to farmers. Also, each person has two days of corvée labor, and when there are matters, all serve. ○ When Keichō campaigns succeeded, the bakufu is said to have granted half of Ryukyu, 100,000 koku, to the Shimazu clan. [This would be the northern islands' territory] In "Ryukyu Kikō," it states that the Lord of Satsuma receives approximately 900,000 dollars annually from Ryukyu, but this is probably false information. If we calculate 900,000 dollars for 100,000 koku, it equals nine dollars per koku, which should be called excessive calculation. However, if there are also profits from miscellaneous taxes and trade, it might perhaps be so. [It is popularly said that half of Satsuma's national expenses came from Ryukyu] ○ In the Meiji 3 recalculation, the central and southern islands had 43,499 households and a population of 234,369 people [136,181 men, 98,188 women]. The household and population figures for the northern islands are not detailed. ○ Since ancient times, the country has had no gold or silver, using only coins [The Ming dynasty provided coins, but the Qing dynasty ceased to provide them]. What is currently in circulation is all Kan'ei Tsūhō. [Many are commonly called "mon coins"] Separately, domestic silver coins are also in circulation. Also, only during the stay of Qing investiture envoys, special small coins are minted. Neither lead nor iron, without rim inscriptions, strung with straw rope and sealed for use. In Meiji 5, the Imperial Court granted 30,000 yen in gold, silver, and paper currency, and envoys also separately requested and obtained exchanges to bring back. ○ The country being poor and small, greatly assists national expenses through trading profits. Each year, ships travel back and forth trading with Satsuma, not using currency but exchanging goods. Traditionally, Ryukyu's products were limited only to Satsuma, prohibiting trade with other domestic people, but in March this year, an order...

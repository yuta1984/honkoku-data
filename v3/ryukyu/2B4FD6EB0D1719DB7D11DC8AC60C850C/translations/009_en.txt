The envoys respectfully received the honor of the imperial edict. Next, from His Majesty and the Empress, the King and Queen received gifts of brocade, velvet, Hakata textiles, floor coverings, flower vases, guns, saddles, □, and other items. Furthermore, the three envoys were granted brocade, silk, ceramics, new currency, and other items. All others in the retinue also received imperial gifts. Separately, 30,000 yen in new currency was granted to Ryukyu Domain. During the envoys' stay in the capital, the Foreign Ministry provided 10,000 yen for expenses, granted them the status of imperial appointees, and they attended the imperial visit for the railway opening ceremony and the poetry gathering at Fukiage Imperial Garden. Moreover, all treaties that Ryukyu had concluded with foreign countries were placed under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Ministry, and officials from that ministry and the Treasury Ministry were ordered to serve in Ryukyu. On the 29th day, Ryukyu Domain King Shō Tai was granted first-class official status, and was also granted a residence in Iidamachi in the capital. At the beginning of the 10th month, the envoys returned to their country.

Regarding tribute relations with China: Emperor Yang of Sui first attacked the Liuqiu kingdom, but it did not submit (corresponding to the reign of Empress Suiko). Through the Tang, Five Dynasties, and Song periods, there was no communication. Both Emperor Shizu and Emperor Chengzong of Yuan attacked Liuqiu, but it also did not submit (corresponding to the time of Hōjō Tokimune and Sadatoki). Emperor Taizu of Ming invited Ryukyu to submit. King Satto of Chūzan then sent envoys and offered local products. Taizu thereupon invested him as King of Chūzan. This was the beginning of sending envoys to China, actually in the 5th year of Hongwu (corresponding to the 1st year of Bunchū of the Southern Court). From then on, the Kings of Nanzan and Hokuzan also successively sent envoys. Taizu invested them all, giving each of the three kings court dress and gold-plated silver seals with camel-shaped knobs. After Nanzan and Hokuzan were destroyed, Chūzan alone did not cease diplomatic ceremonies. Initially it was tribute once a year, later once every two years, with a retinue of 100-200 people, and 10-20 people from chief and vice envoys down going to the capital. Later, during our Korean campaigns and the Keichō conquest, [tribute] briefly ceased. The Hongwu tribute items were horses, swords, gold, silver, wine, gold and silver powder boxes, agate, ivory, shells

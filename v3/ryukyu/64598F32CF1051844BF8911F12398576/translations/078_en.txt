Seizan-kyoku (Green Mountain Melody)
Green mountains and clear waters exist eternally, the realm and nation are preserved forever
When ruler and subjects mutually respect and harmonize with each other, it is truly wonderful. Now in the court, an enlightened ruler and good ministers meet, bestowing benefits
Every household inclines their hearts, like sunflowers turning toward the sun, they long for the thousand-year sovereign
May he protect the nation until mountains become whetstones and rivers become sashes, may the thousand-year sovereign protect the nation until mountains become whetstones and rivers become sashes
Pines stand verdant, unchanging through the four seasons; cypresses grow luxuriantly, never aging through a thousand autumns
These pines and cypresses always maintain spring, knowing no frost or snow, flourishing for ten thousand years. Seeing the beautiful prosperity of the nation, like trees
The country is peaceful and the people secure, prosperity is praised for all generations. For descendants through ten thousand generations, blessings continue without end

　　Shin-ra
With loyal hearts assisting the sovereign, enjoying all manner of glory and wealth
Jade flowers and jade pendants ring with tinkling sounds. What I see is the ceremony of paying respects before the steps. However
My aged eyes are dim and blurred, I cannot distinguish who is elder brother, who is younger brother, who is son, who is grandson
I can only see them arranged orderly in two or three rows. I shall
Encourage them with good words. If I urge them to study diligently, in time
Like spring thunder stirring, the Ministry of Documents will report to the sovereign

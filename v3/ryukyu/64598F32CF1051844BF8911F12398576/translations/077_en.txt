Prosperous years and flourishing times, we pray that the sovereign's blessings be eternally inherited, longevity equal to heaven

　　Shoheichō (Melody of Rising Peace)
In the nine layers of the palace, there is governance without action, the hundred officials are all present, both civil and military are arrayed
On both sides of the court steps, truly a prosperous age, far and near turn to virtue and come to submit, ten thousand years of golden
[■■] The four seasons bring auspicious fortune, vast and boundless grace to the people beyond naming
Ships traverse ten thousand miles, delighting in this age of Yao, old men strike the earth in joy as the bright dawn comes
Our king governs by hanging his robes in repose, we personally wear [his favor]

　　Taiheichō (Melody of Great Peace)
Behold how plants and trees receive rain and dew and thus flourish, the myriad people bathe in gracious favor
They are able to enjoy drumming their bellies and striking the earth, rejoicing endlessly without measure, looking up
See how [the ruler] faces south in non-action, merely hanging his robes - is this not the prosperous age of Xi and Hao?
Now the sovereign is intelligent and wise, and the scholar-officials are good men and gentlemen. Ah! All under heaven is one family, daily spreading grace upon grace. This wave of benevolence
Reaches everywhere without exception - those near are pleased, those far come [in submission]. The benevolent treatment and generous favor
Are like that toward children and grandchildren, like toward hands and feet - all of us
Who are lowly and humble below, how fortunate we are to encounter enlightened goodness and receive such grace upon grace! This
Grace is as high as heaven and as thick as earth. Therefore, far and near all incline with admiring
Hearts of submission to the capital. Who does not leap with joy and delight, looking up toward the elephant towers?

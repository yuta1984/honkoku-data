That country lies to the south of the Eastern Sea and is called Great Ryukyu and Little Ryukyu, facing the territories of Min-Yue and Fujian. With favorable winds, one can reach Ryukyu from Fujian in seven days. From Satsuma it is 350 ri, and with strong winds it takes more than ten days to arrive. During the time of Taikō Hideyoshi,

Ryukyu sent envoys and paid tribute in order to establish trade relations. Since Satsuma and Ōsumi were familiar with sea routes, there was regular ship traffic. When the Great Ming heard of this, they pressured Ryukyu and severed communications with Japan. From this time, there has been no communication from Ryukyu for more than ten years. Iehisa reported this matter [to the shogun].

He asked the captain, saying that one cannot return without receiving the captain's permission. {{Note: From this point, America is referred to as "Semen"}} Then, having received the captain's permission, they set sail, and after several days they arrived at an island. Thinking this must be Japan, they landed at this port. This was indeed the land of Ezo, and all the Ezo people scattered and fled. That night, they lit and burned torches, which appeared to be signal beacon fires, but seeing no welcoming signs, they quickly departed the ship and fled back.

Now Manjiro was taken back to North America, where he practiced writing and studied various subjects. As he grew older, he learned astronomy and was entrusted with bookkeeping. This country differs from Japan - the climate is the same as Japan's. The shoji (sliding doors) of houses are made with glass. Generally, houses are spacious and beautifully constructed. As for crops, wheat is abundant, and rice is also grown to some extent. However, those who eat rice are considered lowly, while wheat is regarded as superior. The food and people, both men and women, are the same as in Japan.

In this country there are seven kings, and kings change every four years. The next king is chosen from among the people, so sometimes one may continue for eight years. When a king continues for eight years, he becomes tremendously wealthy. During the several years Manjiro stayed there, he never saw anyone who appeared to be a king. Both men and women ride horses. They also travel by carriage. One carriage can hold about thirty people. They put heated iron inside, and it moves by itself using fire energy. I do not know what kind of mechanism this is, but it is probably similar to a steamship.

When the king travels, he has only one attendant. Nobles carry tubes with swords attached. Some have no swords, and there are also pistols. This is the same as in Japan. The people of this country are honest and seem to know no evil heart. They produce woolen cloth in great abundance.

According to explanation, they keep sheep in every household, and when autumn comes, they take the wool and weave it into woolen cloth.

Now, in this country, on the seventh day of every month, they hold ancestor festivals in each household. On that day, they close the doors of their houses, and the family members sit quietly inside. Also, marriage arrangements are like those in Japan

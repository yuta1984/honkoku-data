Record of the Drifting of Fishermen from Tosa Province, Great Japan
　　　　　　Recorded by Dontsūshi of Nagasaki, Hizen Province

Long ago, in some imperial era, on the fifth day of the first month, five fishermen who had boarded together were fishing for sea bass with longlines in the offshore waters of a place called Nishi-Misaki in Tosa Province. At this time, there was about two to (approximately 36 liters) of white rice aboard the ship. They remained in that location setting their lines until the seventh day of the same month, when around the hour of the horse (noon), red-colored clouds rose in the west, and wind began blowing from the northwest direction, gradually becoming more violent. Therefore, they tried to quickly haul in the lines they had set and return home, but the wind intensified and they could not bring the boat back to shore. They were blown toward the southeast direction. Despite various efforts, it was to no avail - during this time both the rudder and oars broke, or in their panic, three of their five oars were swept away and the remaining two broke. They were simply blown southeast by the wind and tide, and the wind became increasingly violent

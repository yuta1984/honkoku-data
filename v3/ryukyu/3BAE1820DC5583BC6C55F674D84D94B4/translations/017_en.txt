In the noshi exchange ceremony (similar to exchanging gifts), the bride and groom bow to each other and also eat bread, after which they have intimate relations. Both parties, having become husband and wife from this day, visit various gods. There is no sake cup ceremony at all, as alcoholic drinks make people rough, so they do not drink. In ordinary times, they do drink occasionally. Funeral rites are probably the same as in Japan.

Now Manjiro gradually became proficient in astronomy and was employed on various whaling ships. These whaling ships must have one astronomer, for without one, the vast ocean makes it impossible to determine direction, so there is one astronomer on each ship. The ship's equipment is like that of a warship, with many large cannons loaded. This is for when they encounter pirate ships, not for attacking other countries.

During the three or four years Manjiro was on this ship, he passed by the waters off Japan four or five times. He also went to England and to China. There is also a place called the icy seas, where the ocean freezes and much snow accumulates on top, and they navigate by looking for places where the snow is thin. In this place there are certainly many large whales, so they break the ice to catch them. Since these whales are easy to catch, many people from various countries come here to hunt them.

He also went to the land of black people. All the people of this place are naked, with no clothes to wear, and their food consists only of salt. Their color is black with no luster. This place is called the demon country, or also called the naked country. Women cover their loins with leaves from bushes.

In this place there are also prostitutes, and if you give them opium tobacco or bread, they gladly come to the ship.

Then, after traveling around various countries for four or five years, he went to Oahu and searched for Japanese people. He found that Toraemon alone remained, Jusuke had died, and Denzo and Goemon had returned to Japan. It had been six years since Manjiro separated from the four. A foreigner who was listening nearby said that those two also could not return, but that a ship had returned to port the previous night, so rejoicing, he went to the port and met the two men, told the same story as before, and all four discussed plans for returning to Japan.

Manjiro boarded that ship and returned to America. From there, on the border of South America, there is a place called California. This land resembles Japan's Mount Asama, where fire energy rises from the ground and gold naturally springs forth. Manjiro expressed his desire to go gold mining in this place and requested leave for several days.

In this country, when people die, the king has something like a warehouse on the mountain, and there is a large hole inside it. They bury people there. Generally, important officials use sleeping coffins like in Japan, while those of lower status are cremated. Also, a doctor recently came to this place from Holland, and since there are no decoctions, he uses pills or powdered medicines. He also frequently draws blood with needles. During epidemics and such, they put plenty of water in tubs like sitting baths, put the patients in naked, with only their heads sticking out to cool the fever. These are stories of recovery from such illnesses.

The captain then took these five men to a merchant official in Hawaii. This merchant official's name was Buchiei. The captain's name was Tabutajon. At that time, the captain told the merchant official that he didn't know where these people were from, but he had found them suffering for several days on an uninhabited island and brought them along. The official then brought various coins and showed them to the five men. Among them were Japanese Kanei coins, and when they pointed to these, he realized that they must be Japanese.

So Manjiro got on the original ship, while Denzo, Jusuke, Goemon, and Toraemon were entrusted to the local officials. The captain asked them to take good care of these men, then took Manjiro aboard the ship and returned to his home country. The remaining four men felt sorry for being a burden for so long, so they asked the authorities for permission to leave and decided to make their own living from then on. They did errands, tended fields, or learned carpentry, and did cargo handling work. They were more skilled than the natives and became useful to that country. Even for places that took two days to travel to, they could make day trips, earned considerable money, built houses, and lived comfortably. In this country, they fire cannons every night. However, Jusuke suddenly fell ill and eventually died from his illness. Since this person was Japanese, the local officials provided him with a sleeping coffin and gave him an elaborate funeral.

In the Japanese year of the Snake, they asked the local officials for permission to leave, stating their desire to return to Japan, and from there petitioned the authorities.

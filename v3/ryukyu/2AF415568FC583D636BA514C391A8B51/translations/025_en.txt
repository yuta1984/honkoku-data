"Yangamiko" Mountain Spirit (A mountain deity that employs child attendants called Jirōshi and Gorōshi)
"Kinmanmon" Kun Banbutsu (The guardian deity of the country since the beginning of the world)

○Kun Banbutsu (Kinmanmon) has both yin and yang aspects. That which descends from heaven is called
"Kiraikanai no Kinmanmon," and
that which rises from the sea is called
"Ohotsukakera-ku no Kinmanmon."

○There are thirty-three priestesses who serve this deity, all of whom are from the royal family lineage.
The queen consort is also one of them. This is the same as when imperial princesses in our land (mainland Japan) are dedicated to serve as shrine maidens at Itsuki shrine.

"Shunten Daijingu" Located in Shuri. It enshrines Chinzei Hachirō Tametomo.

○Besides this, there are the sacred groves (ogami-bayashi) of Tamagusuku, Toyomigusuku, Kitadani,
Takamine, and others. "Ogami-bayashi" refers to sacred forests,
and village guardian shrines are called by the same name. There are also many Tenmangu shrines. Because they are called Tenjin, many people
mistakenly think of them as related to "Magoama-shi" and
do not understand that they enshrine Kan-jin (Sugawara no Michizane).
This is said to be because there are many shrines due to the faith of Tametomo and King Shunten.

○When Kun Banbutsu (Kinmanmon) becomes angry, the people of the country practice purification and
perform rituals called "udeori" and "tumaori" to worship and appease the deity.

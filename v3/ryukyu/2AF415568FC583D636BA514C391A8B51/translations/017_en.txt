○The temples belong only to the Rinzai and Shingon (ancient rites) sects, and there were thirty-seven temples in total, but with the closure of Fumon-ji and Saifuku-ji in Kume, there are now thirty-five temples. ○What are called the three great temples of Shuri are Tenno-ji, Tenkai-ji, and Engaku-ji. The royal mausoleum is located in Mawashi Anzato village. Now the construction of new temples and shrines is prohibited.
○The entire country has lascivious customs, and before women marry, they ordinarily associate and play with men, walking hand in hand through the markets and towns. They do not consider this shameful at all, and their parents do not reproach them either. This is one peculiar custom of the country. However, after marriage they maintain chastity and will not even sit together with other men. Their prohibitions and their chastity are beyond what other countries can match. (If someone violates the national laws, they immediately receive divine punishment through the curse of the gods and buddhas, but if they quickly confess and report their sins, the curse will be dispelled.)
○There are extremely many courtesans throughout the country. There are also singing girls (what we call geisha). They play the jabisen and sing the songs of the country. The rhythm is said to be very interesting.

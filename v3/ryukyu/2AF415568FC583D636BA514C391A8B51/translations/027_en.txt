○Satonoshi corresponds to what we call kosho (page boys) in our country. They select handsome young men for this position. When they grow older and grow beards, they become Hēkin. According to their national custom, they do not use razors, and let their beards grow naturally. Also, since their skin color is generally dark, they appear older than their actual age. While Hēkin is an official title, according to the customs of that country, all warriors are called "Ohēkin" and such.

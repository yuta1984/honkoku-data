"Kimitesuri" - A deity that appears once every seven years
"Yomikameri" - A deity that appears once every twelve years

When these two deities appear, all the people fear and revere them, worshipping them in their respective homes. Also, about one hundred officials carrying five-colored umbrellas come forth from Tamagusuku to welcome the deities into the castle, offering various fine wines and rare confections, presenting flower arrangements and lanterns while the king himself conducts the worship and prays for the people's peace. For seven days, they keep the umbrellas raised. These umbrellas are decorated in various beautiful colors, with the longest ones reaching four to five jō in length and twenty hiro in width. Even the shorter ones are about two jō long, and several hundred of them are erected in the spacious courtyards. People go to the gates to worship from afar.

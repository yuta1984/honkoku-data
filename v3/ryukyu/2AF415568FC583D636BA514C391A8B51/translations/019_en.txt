They are fastened here and there with kohaze (metal clasps). The patterns
have beautiful dyed colors. There are also thin fabrics
with five-colored threads, gold thread, etc.
embroidered with various grasses and flowers.
Women sometimes hang long jeweled ornaments
from their waists. Also, even in winter,
since it is a country that knows no cold like our summer,
there is no practice of putting cotton padding
in the kimono. Men's
clothing is generally
similar to that of China.
What is depicted here is a person of the rank
called "aji" or similar. With proper
and dignified national customs,
even when going to play with courtesans,
they proceed with proper decorum.
The pleasure house is called
"furubeya."
Dancing is called
"menko-toguri."

♪Thread willow heart
　Country desolate
　　Night hands of this world
　　　Those who know the light garments
　　　　Wind and sunshine are good

○This song is what has been sung since ancient times,
　called the "Willow Wind melody"
　　　It is also recorded in Master Sorai's diplomatic mission record

Furthermore, there is a colloquial expression in Ryukyu called "futsurorochii." Since it sounds like the Japanese word "osoroshii" (frightening/terrible), I thought it meant something frightening, but it actually means something very joyful. There must be many such differences.

What I record here is merely written down as I heard it, provided for the perusal of those interested in such matters.

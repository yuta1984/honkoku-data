○A god worshipped in the Ryukyu Kingdom
"Ouchikiu" Suihaku (also called Fuunakiu, a water deity)
The appearance of this god: about one jō (approximately 3 meters) tall with disheveled white hair, large eyes that shine like lightning. The body is clothed in yellow garments and feet are shod. The testicles are extremely large and wrapped in a loincloth. Those who see this deity are said to receive good fortune. Images of this god are carved or painted in temples throughout the country and are revered.

○There exists a sacred talisman to avoid water disasters
This is said to be taught and explained by Fuunakiu. The priest Banmyō of "Toyokusuku" received it through divine inspiration in a dream, and its spiritual efficacy is remarkable. It is said to be a divine image.

Shō Shin was the heir of Shō En, born in the first year of Chenghua, yiyou (1465). He succeeded to the throne at age thirteen. In the fourteenth year of Chenghua (1478), he sent Chancellor Liang Ying and others to request investiture. Emperor Xianzong appointed Dong Min, Administrative Vice Commissioner of the Ministry of War, as chief envoy, and Zhang Xiang, Vice Director of the Court of State Ceremonial, as deputy envoy to carry the imperial edict to the kingdom and invest Crown Prince Shō Shin as King of Chūzan, bestowing upon him a leather crown, court robes, a gold-inlaid rhinoceros horn belt, and colored silk to the king and queen.

The imperial treasury should be opened to provide equal compensation in order, so as not to reduce too severely and lose the intention of treating distant peoples gently." This was approved.

In the twentieth year (1484), the king sent envoy Cheng Peng to tribute horses and local products, memorializing: "The ships granted during the Yongle era have been completely destroyed, with only three remaining.

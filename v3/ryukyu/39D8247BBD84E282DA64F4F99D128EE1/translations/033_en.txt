and local products, and was granted clothing and silk for both. In the fifth year (1469), the king sent Chief Secretary Cai Jing to submit tribute and also sent envoys including Cha Nongshi to submit tribute, with banquets and rewards as usual.

The Chūzan Seikan states: King Shō Toku did not cultivate virtue, engaged in fishing and hunting morning and evening, and was tyrannical and immoral. Kikaijima rebelled and did not pay tribute for several years. The king personally led forces to attack it, and upon returning became increasingly arrogant, leading to his downfall. He reigned for nine years, died before reaching thirty in the fifth year of Chenghua, ji-chou (1469), at the age of twenty-nine. Since the heir apparent was young, the people of the kingdom deposed him and elevated Uchima Satunushi Omisasoki to become King Shō En of Chūzan.

From Shishō through Shō Hashi to Shō Toku, altogether seven generations spanning sixty-four years.

Shō En
In the sixth year of Chenghua of the Ming dynasty, geng-yin (1470), Shō En ascended the throne.

The Chūzan Seikan states: Shō En was a person from Hokuii Ihei, namely Hapekiyama. He was born in the thirteenth year of Yongle, yi-wei (1415), with the courtesy name Shitokukin. His ancestry cannot be known. Some say that Yoshimoto abdicated and went into hiding in Hokuzan, and he is suspected to be his descendant. Another account says that in Hapeki there was an ancient peak called Tensondake. Shō En was a descendant of the Tenson clan. His father Shō Shoku served as village headman. Shō En's birth was accompanied by auspicious omens. At age twenty-four, he first crossed to Kunigami and came to serve Chūzan. During Shō Kinpuku's time, he was first granted the yellow cap. During Shō Taikyū's time, he became lord of Uchima, and all the people of Uchima loved and respected him. During a prolonged drought when all rice seedlings withered, his fields alone remained moist without rain, and the people were amazed and spoke of it as miraculous. The king became fearful and took his wife and children into hiding for fourteen years. His virtue grew daily, and Shō Kinpuku, hearing of his worthiness, summoned him and made him a yellow cap official.

[He] was sent to the imperial prison. The Ministry of Rites requested that Fu also be punished and his rewards revoked. Emperor Shizong said: "Chen Fu is without fault. Rewards should be as usual. Cai Tinghui colluded with court officials and should be severely punished according to law, but considering he belongs to the tributary mission, we will temporarily revoke his rewards to demonstrate punishment. Since Cai Jing was already sent out during the Yongle period, how could he establish property and household registration in China? Send officials to investigate and handle this matter."

In the twenty-eighth year (1549), the king sent Senior Counselor Liang Xian to present tribute, with banquets and rewards as usual. In the twenty-ninth year (1550), the king sent five student officials including Cai Chaoyong and others to the capital requesting to enter the National Academy to study, which was permitted. In the thirty-second year (1553), the king sent Chief Secretary Liang Xuan to present tribute, with banquets and rewards as usual. In the thirty-fourth year (1555), the king sent Senior Counselor Liang Shuo to present tribute, who stated in detail: "When tribute ships reach port, they will inevitably be damaged. We request that envoys be allowed to purchase civilian ships at sea to sail back." An edict ordered Fujian officials to review the situation and permit purchases, but not exceeding large vessels. [The king] also requested to release student officials Cai Chaoyong and others to return home to visit their parents, which was permitted, and envoys were sent to escort them back.

The Chuzan Seikan states: The king was intelligent and decisive in judgment, strong-willed and heroically resolute, able to revive the legacy left by his grandfather Sho En and father Sho Shin. He initiated many reforms in domestic affairs, and laws are still observed to this day. The northeastern vassal state of Oshima, in the sixteenth year of Jiajing (1537), relied on its distance to cut off tribute and ceased paying court. The king sent generals to attack it, and again [the island] maintained tribute as usual. The king reigned for twenty-nine years, lived to fifty-nine years of age, and died in the thirty-fourth year of Jiajing (1555).

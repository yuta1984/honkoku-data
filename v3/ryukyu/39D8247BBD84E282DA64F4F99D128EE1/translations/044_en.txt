took the throne. In the thirty-sixth year of Jiajing (1557), Sho Gen sent Senior Counselor Cai Tinghui and others to present tribute and request investiture.

Previously (to record this), in the thirty-fifth year (1556), Japanese pirates were defeated in Zhejiang and returned to sea, reaching the territory of Ryukyu. Crown Prince Sho Gen of the Chuzan Kingdom sent troops to intercept and attack them, completely annihilating them and recovering six Chinese captives including Jin Kun. At this time, Tinghui and others came to present tribute and returned [the captives], stating: "The distant people of this remote island must rely on the summer season and encounter southern winds to be able to return to their country. We humbly request that, as in the example of the thirty-fourth year, we may annually procure return ships ourselves without waiting for official approval." Emperor Shizong praised their loyalty and obedience, granted this request, bestowed an edict of commendation, rewarded them with fifty taels of silver and four sets of colored silk, and generously rewarded those with merit including Ma Bidu and Tinghui.

In the thirty-seventh year (1558), Supervising Secretary Wu Shilai and Herald Li Jichun were dispatched as chief and deputy envoys. Soon after, Shilai submitted a memorial criticizing the treacherous conduct of Grand Secretary Yan Song. Song claimed that "[this man] fears the naval mission and therefore creates trouble with false accusations." Emperor Shizong was angered, had Shilai beaten with rods and sent to frontier garrison duty, and instead appointed Supervising Secretary of Justice Guo Rulin as chief envoy to travel together with Jichun.

In the thirty-ninth year (1560), before Rulin and others had departed, Senior Counselor Cai Tinghui came to present tribute, offered a memorial of gratitude, and claimed to have received orders from his crown prince, saying: "The storms at sea are unpredictable, and Japanese pirates appear at irregular times. We fear that envoys might encounter other dangers and incur guilt before the imperial court. We request that, following the precedent of the investiture of Champa during the Zhengde period, we send people to present memorials and local products on our behalf, while we ourselves, together with our country's Chief Secretary Liang Xuan and others, carry back the imperial edict and investiture documents, thus avoiding the trouble of dispatching envoys." Regional Inspector Fen Xianke reported this, and it was referred to the Ministry of Rites for discussion. They stated: "Ryukyu among the maritime nations is particularly known for observing propriety, therefore successive dynasties have treated it with exceptional favor. Whenever a king succeeds to the throne, [the court] must dispatch attendant ministers bearing ceremonial robes

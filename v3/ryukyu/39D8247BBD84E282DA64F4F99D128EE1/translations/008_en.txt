The records in the Chuzan Seikan (Chuzan World Mirror) had quite a few discrepancies with what was recorded in the Chronicle of Chuzan. Later, upon detailed
　　inquiry in this country about this book, I learned it was written by Sho Shokaku (styled Bun'ei), a cousin of Sho Shitsu.
　　When Envoy Wang conducted the investiture of King Sho Tei, this book was not yet complete. Since the founding of Chuzan,
　　it was not until Shunten that there was a proper state structure, and not until Sho Shokaku that someone first conducted thorough research and extensively collected materials to complete this
　　book. This country praises his intelligence and talent, saying he assisted his nephew Sho Tei and rendered great service to the state. His
　　book must certainly be detailed and reasonable, but regrettably I was unable to see the complete work. Now I merely examine and verify the
　　genealogical succession of past dynasties, and append the matters of investiture and tribute relations from the Ming History records adopted by Wang Ji
　　as reference material for verification.
　According to the Chuzan Seikan, the founding ancestor of Ryukyu was the Tenson clan. In the beginning, one man and one woman
　were born in the great wilderness and naturally became husband and wife. Called Amamiku, they bore three sons and two daughters. The eldest son became
　the beginning of the Tenson clan rulers, the second son the beginning of the lords, the third son the beginning of the common people.
　The eldest daughter was called Kimi-kimi, the second daughter Noro-noro, and they became the protective deities of the country. One was a heavenly god, one
　was a sea god. The Tenson clan continued for twenty-five generations, but their surnames cannot be verified today, so they are omitted.
　Beginning in the year yichou and ending in bingwu, a total of 17,802 years. Now I begin from Shunten.

　Shunten was a Japanese, a descendant of the imperial family, and the son of Osato Aji Choko. In the 7th year of Chunxi

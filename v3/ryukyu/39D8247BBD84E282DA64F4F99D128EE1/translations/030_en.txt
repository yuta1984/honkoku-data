[He] died in the fourth year, gui-you (1453).

Shō Taikyū

In the fifth year of Jingtai, jia-xu (1454), Shō Taikyū ascended the throne.

According to the "Chūzan Seikan" (Mirror of Chūzan Generations), Taikyū was the first son of Shō Kinpuku, born in the thirteenth year of Yongle, yi-wei (1415), and ascended the throne at forty years old.

According to the "Ming Shilu" (Veritable Records of Ming), after Kinpuku died, his younger brother Furi and his son Shirō competed for the throne, burned the government treasury, and both were wounded and died together. The bestowed gold-plated silver seal was also melted and destroyed. The people of the country supported Shō Taikyū to govern state affairs. In the fifth year of Jingtai (1454), Taikyū reported this matter and also requested that a seal be cast and bestowed. [The emperor] commanded the relevant officials to provide it. Soon after, [he] again dispatched envoys to submit tribute, with memorials styling [himself] as "Shō Taikyū, royal brother governing state affairs of the Ryukyu Kingdom." Emperor Jingtai commanded [the envoys] to carry an imperial edict and colored silk to return and bestow them upon the royal brother. In the sixth year, the royal brother twice dispatched envoys to submit tribute, and [the emperor] sent Administrative Vice Censor Yan Cheng [marginal note: "Shuyu Zhouzilu" records this as Li Bingyi] as chief envoy and Herald Liu Jian as deputy envoy, carrying an imperial decree to enfeoff royal brother Shō Taikyū to succeed as king. The decree stated: "Emperors rule over all under Heaven, always viewing with impartiality and showing universal benevolence. Vassal states lead their countries, sometimes succeeding through blood relations. We personally received the Mandate of Heaven to govern all feudal lords. Since King Shō Kinpuku of the Ryukyu Kingdom has died, his brother Shō Taikyū possesses excellent and magnanimous character, and the people of the country have given him their allegiance. We now specially dispatch envoys carrying this edict to enfeoff him as King of Chūzan of the Ryukyu Kingdom. All officials and commoners, far and near, within that country should wholeheartedly assist and support [him], and let there be no discord or disobedience. Long maintain loyal and obedient hearts, and forever enjoy the blessings of great peace. Therefore this decree is proclaimed for all to hear and know." [The emperor] also issued an edict to the king saying: "Since your ancestors you have faithfully maintained your vassal obligations, passed down to your elder brother

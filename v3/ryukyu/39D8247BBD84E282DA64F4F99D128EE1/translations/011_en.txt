declined and governance fell into disarray; internally he was dissolute with women, externally he was obsessed with hunting. The various aji did not pay court, and the country was divided into three:
the Chūzan King, Nanzan King, and Hokuzan King. The Nanzan King was the Ōzato Aji, and the eleven countries of Sashiki, Chi-
nen, Tamashiro, Gushichan, Kochinda, Shimajiri, Kyan, Mabuni, Makabe, Kane-
gusuku, and Tomigusuku followed the Nanzan King. The Hokuzan King was the Nakijin Aji,
and several countries including Haneji, Nago, Kunigami, Kin, Ie, Ōgimi, Nakijin, and Onna
followed the Hokuzan King. Chūzan had only Shuri royal castle and several countries including Naha, Tomari, Urasoe, Hoku-
kei, Nakagusuku, Goeku, Yomitanzan, Gushikawa, Katsuren, and Shuri's Three Hei (Shuri had Nishihei, Nan-
hei, Majihei, etc., called the Three Hei). Chūzan, Nanzan, and Hokuzan frequently raised armies and fought against each other for
several decades. Tamashiro reigned for twenty-three years and lived to forty-one years of age.
　Seiī
In Zhiyuan 3rd year, dingchou of the Yuan Dynasty, Seiī succeeded to the throne.

the queen mother, and the hen ruled in disorder. At this time Satto became the Urasoe Aji, possessed virtue, and the people submitted to him.

He reigned for approximately twenty-six years after ascending the throne. In that country, when succeeding to the throne through hereditary succession, the custom was to first establish oneself independently and then petition the court. Therefore, the recorded years of succession often do not match the times when the Chinese court dispatched envoys for investiture. However, in the early Ming period, tribute missions were intermittent, and there were such discrepancies in investiture and death years that did not correspond properly to the chronology. That is to say, although it is claimed he succeeded in Hongwu 29, the Jingnan Rebellion occurred in between, causing the notification to exceed the proper time. Considering that if he reigned for twenty-six years, he should still have been well at the end of the Yongle era, why then were there funeral rites and condolence gifts in the fifth year? According to the Chūzan Seikan, Bunei reigned for twenty-six years and died in Yongle 19 (xinchou year), with Shō Hashi ascending in Yongle 20, which matches the records in the genealogical chart, but all are incorrect. When extensively questioning the elderly and experienced people in the country, they say Bunei received investiture in Yongle 4, died in Yongle 3, and reigned for ten years. After Shō Hashi had already destroyed Sannan and Sanhoku, he subsequently also destroyed the King of Chūzan, unified the three kingdoms into one, and honored his father Shishō as king. The Ming Veritable Records state that in Yongle 5, Crown Prince Shishō announced the death of his father Bunei and requested to inherit the title, which matches perfectly like fitting together tally pieces.

From Satto to Bunei, there were approximately two successions totaling fifty-six years.

Shishō
In Ming Yongle 4, bingxu year, Shishō ascended the throne.
According to the Ming Veritable Records, in Yongle 5, fourth month, Crown Prince Shishō sent Sagōrō-bi to tribute horses and local products, and separately sent an envoy to announce the death of his father Bunei. Emperor Chengzu commanded the Ministry of Rites to

[News of the death] was heard at court, and [the emperor] commanded the Ministry of Rites to dispatch officials to bestow sacrificial offerings and funeral gifts of cloth and silk. In the ninth month, Court Gentleman Zhou Yi was sent bearing an edict to carry out [the mission]. <<Marginal note: According to one account, when Emperor Renzong succeeded to the throne, he commanded Court Gentleman Fang Yi to proclaim an edict to that country>>

<<Marginal note: This minister>> notes that according to the Chronicle of Chūzan's Changes, Shishō succeeded to the throne in Yonglo 5 and died in the 23rd year, reigning for eighteen years, but this is incorrect.

The retinue, clan members, and procession were overseen by guard commanders (bantō) appointed by the Lord of Satsuma.

1. Before the Shogun's appearance, the Lord of Satsuma came as far as outside the partition screen of the Pine Room (Matsu-no-ma) in the Great Hall (Ōhiroma).

2. The envoys were positioned in the southern part of the palace compound in the Great Hall, guided by inspectors (metsuke) from the Palace Hall (Denjō-no-ma).

3. The Lord of Satsuma attended and had an audience within the lower tier inside the threshold, which was announced by the master of ceremonies (sōja-ban). He immediately withdrew to his original seat, and the senior councilors (rōjū) summoned him to present the envoys before the Shogun. The content of the Shogun's directive was conveyed to the Lord of Satsuma in the antechamber, with the senior councilors in attendance.

4. The Lord of Satsuma attended again and took his seat on the eastern side of the lower tier.

5. Regarding the various gifts from the King of Chūzan, they were arranged for the Shogun's viewing from the eastern and western sides of the southern wooden veranda before his appearance.
   However, the horses were led in the courtyard by Suwabe Bunkurō and Suwabe Bunzaemon.

6. The catalog of the ceremonial sword offering was placed by the master of ceremonies from below the middle tier to the four-mat area. The envoy, announced as representing the King of Chūzan, came from the lower tier to bow at the four-mat area, then withdrew to his original seat. The sword catalog was retrieved by the master of ceremonies, and the gifts were taken by the gift officials from the western side to the Willow Room (Yanagi-no-ma).

The envoy Gushishū came and entered the capital, completed his audience, was granted leave to return to his country, conveyed the gracious command of our Great Lord under the shogunal authority, and received the several items of imperial favor with overwhelming reverent joy. I dispatched the envoy Kaneshiro to Satsuma to offer thanks. Moreover, regarding the items I sent to you and what was bestowed upon Gushishū, these were also acknowledged, and now several gifts have been sent as listed in the catalog and received. From such a distant foreign land and remote journey, this manifestation of sincere feelings calls for great rejoicing. The rest will be discussed and shown through the Lord of Satsuma. With fear and reverence, incompletely stated.

The fragrant letter of the third day of the sixth month was delivered from the Great Lord of Satsuma Province. Last year's tribute-bearing envoy Gushishū returned to his country, conveyed the instructions of our two Great Lords, and reverently received the bestowed items according to their number. In his deep gratitude, he again dispatched the envoy Kaneshiro to Satsuma Province to express his respectful thanks. Moreover, regarding the gifts I presented to you and the humble items granted to Gushishū, he expressed words of gratitude for all, which can truly be called courteous. This time again, three types of local products were sent as listed in the catalog and received. From such a distant journey, this sincere thoughtfulness reaches the utmost degree. The rest will be communicated through the Lord of Satsuma. With fear and reverence, incompletely stated.

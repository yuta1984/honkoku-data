Now then,
Regarding the birth of the young lord, with a thousand joys and a hundred celebrations, what a auspicious sign of peace for your noble country! Our small nation has also heard of this and remains in comfort, therefore we respectfully send an envoy as congratulations for ten thousand years and ten thousand times ten thousand years. The catalog of presentations is on a separate sheet. Details will be conveyed orally, so if this is appropriately communicated to your noble attention, it would be most fortunate. With utmost reverence and humble words.

I respectfully present this letter. Regarding the matter of Ryukyu Kingdom's succession being confirmed in peace, I learned of this last winter through a messenger sent by the great lord Mitsuhisa of Satsuma Province, and I am truly filled with reverent joy beyond measure and limitless gratitude. Therefore,
to express congratulations to His Excellency the Shogun, I have prepared modest items to express my small intentions. Other matters will be explained by the envoy, so
I humbly request your favorable consideration before your noble presence. This is inadequately expressed.

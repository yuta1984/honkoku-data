Last autumn, when I had an audience and your country conveyed congratulatory words for my enthronement, the envoy Prince Gushishū arrived in Chūzan Kingdom in early summer. First, I report that those under the shogunate remain peaceful and well, which is most fortunate. Originally, after the envoy paid respects to the Great Counselor, until the day he came to Egusuku for departure, I was honored to receive letters from the Great Elder and received clothing and silver. Truly, having received these multiple times, I cannot bear the feeling of awe and fear. Therefore, through Kanegusuku, I respectfully present these humble local products. As Lord Satsuma Mitsuhisa will convey the details, I cannot elaborate fully here. With fear and reverence, I bow deeply.

Last year, having had an audience with those under the shogunate, when the envoy Gushishū was ordered by the Great Elder to ascend to the castle and paid respects to both Great Lords, truly there is nothing comparable to my awe and joy at this. In addition, the benevolence of receiving various precious goods is boundless even when I humbly restrain myself. Moreover, regarding the reply letter and cotton that you bestowed for our use, and furthermore the gracious act of also giving silver to Gushishū, I know not how to express my gratitude. As Kanegusuku will convey the details, I cannot elaborate here. With fear and reverence, this is inadequate.

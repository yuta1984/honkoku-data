In reply　King of Chūzan
　　　　　　　Before the residence

The fragrant letter of the third day of the sixth month was transmitted by the Lord of Satsuma. Last year Gushishū came bearing tribute, had audience with the two Great Lords, and returned to his country, conveying their commands and reverently receiving your several items as listed in the catalog. I well understand the intent of sending the envoy Kaneshiro to Satsuma for the purpose of expressing gratitude for this. Moreover, regarding the items I presented to you and what was bestowed upon Gushishū, gratitude was also expressed, which can truly be called courteous. This time again, local products were sent according to their number and received. This utmost sincere thoughtfulness from such a distant journey brings no small joy. The rest is entrusted to and sent through the Lord of Satsuma. With fear and reverence, incompletely stated.

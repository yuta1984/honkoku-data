King of Chūzan
Kan'ei 22nd year, 2nd month, 18th day　　　　Shō Ken
Respectfully submitted to Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami-sama

When Hisanobu conveyed the letter of the 18th day of the 2nd month through Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami,
we clearly understood that last summer
the envoys from your country, Kin and Kunigami, came to court and were granted audience under our
Great Lord's curtain government, spoke about the joyous occasion of the Great Counselor, and upon their return voyage, gifts were bestowed upon the elder
brother, and both envoys as well as their attendants were fortunate to receive benevolent favor. Now again, in gratitude for such profound
benevolence, we are having Prince Yomitanzan arrive in Satsuma Province to express our gratitude and respect, which Hisanobu reported,
thereby reaching your
esteemed hearing. Regarding the local products and tributes presented, when these were also reported, they greatly stirred feelings of joy, and there is nothing more gratifying than to appreciate such intentions.
For other matters, we entrust them to Hisanobu's verbal communication. With utmost reverence and inadequate expression.

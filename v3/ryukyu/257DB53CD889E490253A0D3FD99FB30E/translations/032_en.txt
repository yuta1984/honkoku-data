In reply　　King of Chūzan

I received and opened the letter of the third day of late summer transmitted through the Lord of Satsuma. Last year the envoy Gushishū came to court, reverently met His Lordship under the shogunal authority, and when he was granted leave to return to his country, you received those imperial gifts with deep gratitude and sent the envoy Kaneshiro to Satsuma Province to express thanks. Moreover, you also expressed words of gratitude for the items we presented to you and those bestowed upon Gushishū. You sent various local products, which I have examined and received according to the catalog. From such a distant land and long journey, your sincere heart should inspire great joy. For other matters, I rely on what the Lord of Satsuma has stated. With fear and reverence, I leave this unsaid.

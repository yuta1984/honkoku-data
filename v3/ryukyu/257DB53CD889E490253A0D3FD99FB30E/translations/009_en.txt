the local products as listed in the catalog, bringing them to the castle, and exclusively
　presenting them for the lord's inspection, whereupon both envoys were
　summoned before His Presence, and his mood was exceptional. Moreover, having received the gifts for myself
　as written, I am deeply grateful for your generous sentiment. Therefore, though modest from our side,
　we send two hundred bundles of Echizen cotton as a small token of our sincere feelings. Respectfully stated.

I respectfully present this letter in response to last autumn when I specially dispatched an envoy to offer congratulations for your Great Lord (Shogun) inheriting the previous enterprise and greatly displaying military prowess. That envoy, Prince Kunigami, following the Great Elder's instructions, ascended to Edo Castle and paid respects to your Great Lord. Truly, my awe and joy—what could compare to this? Moreover, I was granted precious items and have respectfully received them. Furthermore, the envoy not only received clothing and silver, but the attendants also benefited from your additional favor. I bow again and again, unable to contain my feelings of reverent fear. I can only offer my humble prostration through Yafuso. Also, regarding the circular document and raw cotton bestowed by the Great Elder, I have gratefully received and used them with such joy that I know not how to express my thanks. Since Satsuma Shōshō can provide detailed explanations, I cannot elaborate further here. With fear and reverence, I leave much unsaid.

Eighth day of sixth month, third year of Jōō　　　　Shō Shitsu

Respectfully presented to Lord Sakai Sanuki-no-kami

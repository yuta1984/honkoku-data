Prince Kunigami

Last autumn, I paid respects to your country and conveyed congratulations for your Great Lord (Shogun) inheriting the governance from his predecessor and pacifying the nation. As an envoy for this purpose, Prince Kunigami arrived in the Kingdom of Chūzan on the twenty-eighth day of spring, and following the instructions of the Great Elder, Prince Kunigami ascended to Edo Castle and paid respects to your Great Lord. Later, on the day of departure from Edo Castle, I (the King of Chūzan) humbly received your gracious golden letter (official document), along with gifts of raw cotton and silver, which I received directly according to their quantities. The envoy received clothing and silver, and the attendants also were honored to receive clothing and silver. Truly, my gratitude and joy cannot be measured. Therefore, through my retainer Yafuso, I express my gratitude and humbly present these modest local products. Since Satsuma Shōshō (Shimazu Mitsuhisa) can provide detailed explanations, I set down my brush here. With fear and reverence, I bow deeply.

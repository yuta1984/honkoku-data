The letter of the third day of the sixth month arrived from the Lord of Satsuma, and I have read it. Last year the envoy Gushishū who came to court ascended to the camp (Edo Castle), reverently met His Lordship under the shogunal authority, and when granted leave to return to his country, he received with reverence the several items bestowed upon him. I understand the intent that the envoy Kaneshiro was dispatched to Satsuma Province to express gratitude for this. Moreover, you expressed words of thanks for the items we sent to you and the assistance provided to Gushishū, and I have received the various local products you have now sent according to their number. From such a distant castle and remote journey, your sincere intentions are not shallow, bringing me utmost satisfaction. For the rest, the Lord of Satsuma will inform you. With fear and reverence, incompletely stated.

The letter of the third day of the sixth month was transmitted from the Lord of Satsuma. Last year the envoy Gushishū came to court, ascended to the castle, completed his respectful ceremonies and returned to his country, conveying the words of our Great Lord under the shogunal authority. The goods bestowed upon you were reverently received according to the catalog. Feeling deeply grateful, you sent the envoy Kaneshiro to Satsuma Province to express thanks. Moreover, you expressed gratitude for both the humble items I presented to you and those given to Gushishū, and I have now received and accepted the local products you sent according to their number. From such a foreign land and long journey, your sincere devotion brings no small satisfaction. This shall be further explained through the Lord of Satsuma. With fear and reverence, incompletely stated.

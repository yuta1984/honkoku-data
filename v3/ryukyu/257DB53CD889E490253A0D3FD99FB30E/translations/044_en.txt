Your gracious letter of the eighth day of the sixth month was delivered recently and I read it with deep respect. Now, last autumn, your country's envoy Kunigami came to present tribute and pay respects to your Great Lord, and upon completing the ceremony was granted leave to return to his country. At that time, Your Honor was fortunately blessed with imperial gifts, and the envoy also humbly received my benevolence. Hearing that Your Honor was filled with joy, and that you have now dispatched the envoy Yafuso to arrive in Satsuma Province to offer thanks, and that you have also expressed words of gratitude for the items I sent, moreover sending three local products as listed in the catalog, which I have received - this can truly be called the height of sincere courtesy. For the rest, since the Satsuma-no-kami will relate it, I shall not elaborate further.

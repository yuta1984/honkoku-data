the Lord reported, and it reached His Lordship's ears. Moreover, when the various local products that were presented were displayed according to their inventory, His Lordship's countenance showed great joy, and you may set your distant heart at ease. The details shall be conveyed through the Lord of Satsuma. With fear and reverence, I leave this unsaid.

Third year of Keian, [month and day]　　Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Norijū

In reply　　King of Chūzan
　　　　　　Before the residence

I received and read the letter of the third day of the sixth month, transmitted from the Governor of Satsuma Province, Mitsuhisa. Last year, your envoy Gushishū came to pay tribute, reverently met our Two Great Lords, was granted leave to return to his country, conveyed the strict commands, and humbly received with gratitude the numerous items bestowed according to the catalog. Moreover, the items granted to Gushishū and his attendants brought peace to all, and knowing this intent, in the excess of joy and unable to contain his humble anxiety, he sent the envoy Kaneshiro to Satsuma Province to express gratitude. The Lord of Satsuma disclosed this matter, and when it reached His Lordship's ears, there was great joy—do not trouble yourself with distant thoughts. Particularly regarding the items I presented to you and those granted to Gushishū, these were truly expressions of my modest sincerity, yet the words of gratitude expressed were most earnest. Now you have sent three types of local products, which I have received in full. From such a distant foreign land, your thoughtful sentiment is cause for joy. I shall still rely on the Lord of Satsuma to convey this message. With fear and reverence, [unsaid]

The fragrant letter of the third day of the sixth month arrived from the Lord of Satsuma, and I have received and read it. Last year the envoy Gushishū came bearing tribute, ascended to the camp (Edo Castle), completed his respectful ceremonies and returned to his country, conveying the respectful command of our Great Lord under the shogunal authority, and reverently received the items bestowed according to their number. In his overwhelming gratitude, he sent his retainer Kaneshiro to Satsuma to offer thanks. You also expressed gratitude for the items we sent to you and the humble goods given to Gushishū, and I have now received the local products you favored us with according to the catalog. From such a distant foreign land and remote journey, your sincere feelings bring great joy. Other matters will be conveyed through the Lord of Satsuma. With fear and reverence, incompletely stated.

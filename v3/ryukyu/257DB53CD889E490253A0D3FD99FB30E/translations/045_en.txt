Your gracious letter of the eighth day of the sixth month arrived recently, and I read it with great pleasure. Last autumn, your country's envoy Kunigami presented tribute and paid respects to our Great Lord, and upon completing the ceremony was granted leave to return to his country. At that time, Your Honor was fortunately blessed with imperial favor, and Kunigami and others also humbly received my benevolence. Hearing that Your Honor was filled with joy, and that you have now dispatched the envoy Yafuso to arrive in Satsuma Province to offer thanks, and that you have also expressed words of gratitude for what I sent, moreover sending three local products as listed separately, which I have received - this is truly the height of sincere courtesy. For the rest, since the Satsuma Minor General will relate it, I shall not elaborate further.

Your letter from the eighth day of late summer arrived recently and I read it with deep respect. Last year in autumn, your country's envoy Kunigami came to court and paid respects to our Great Lord, and upon completing the ceremony was granted leave to return to his country. At that time, Your Honor received imperial favor, and Kunigami and others also humbly received gifts. Hearing that Your Honor was filled with joy, and that you have again sent the envoy Yafuso to arrive in Satsuma Province to offer words of gratitude, and that you have also expressed thanks for what we sent, sending three local products as enumerated, which I have received - this can be called the height of sincere intention. For other matters, the Satsuma Minor General will relate them, so I shall not elaborate further.

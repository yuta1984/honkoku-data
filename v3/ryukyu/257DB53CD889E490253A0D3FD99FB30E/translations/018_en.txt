expressions of joy. You may rest assured regarding distant concerns. Moreover, your expression of gratitude for the humble gifts that we presented - is this not the utmost sincerity? Now you have also sent two kinds of local products, which we have inspected and received with great joy. Other matters will be
communicated through Satsuma-no-kami. With utmost reverence, inadequately expressed.

　Reply to　King of Chūzan

The letter of the 18th day of mid-spring was recently conveyed by Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami, and upon per-
usal brings great joy. As stated in your correspondence, last summer

the envoys from your noble country, Kin and Kunigami, came to Edo castle to respectfully have audience with our
Great Lord and offered congratulations to
His Excellency the Dainagon. When they were granted leave to return to their country, gifts were bestowed upon them. Your Excellency, deeply moved by this, sent
Prince Yomitanzan to cross over to Satsuma Province as a respectful envoy. Satsuma-no-kami reported this matter in detail and
presented it to the throne, which greatly stirred
expressions of joy. Do not trouble yourself with distant worries. Furthermore, your expression of gratitude for the token gifts that we sent - is this not also most sin-
cere? And now you have presented two kinds of local products, which we have inspected and received with great fortune. Other matters will be
communicated through Satsuma-no-kami. With utmost reverence, inadequately expressed.

the envoys from your noble country, Kin and Kunigami, came to Edo to have audience with our
Great Lord and also offered congratulations to
His Excellency the Dainagon. When they were granted leave to return to their country, gifts were bestowed. Your Excellency, moved by this deep sentiment,
appointed Prince Yomitanzan as an envoy, who has now crossed over to Satsuma Province to express gratitude. This matter
Satsuma-no-kami reported, and it was immediately brought to
His Lordship's attention, resulting in
expressions of royal pleasure. Do not trouble yourself with distant concerns. Moreover, your expression of gratitude for the humble gifts that we presented—is this not
the height of sincerity? The local products you presented have been received in full according to their number and stored with great joy. Other matters
will be communicated through Satsuma-no-kami. With utmost reverence, inadequately expressed.

Reply to the King of Chūzan

The esteemed letter of February 18th was recently conveyed by Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami, and upon perusal
we are most pleased. As your letter stated, last summer
the envoys from your noble country, Kin and Kunigami, came to pay tribute and offer congratulations to our
young lord, and when they were granted leave to return to their country, some gifts were bestowed. Your Excellency received these respectfully, and now
again you have appointed Prince Yomitanzan as an envoy to cross over to Satsuma Province to express gratitude. This matter
Satsuma-no-kami has described in detail, and your expression of gratitude for our humble gifts shows sincerity

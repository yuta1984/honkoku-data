By the Mandate of Heaven and bearing the dynastic succession, the Emperor issues this edict: I humbly receive Heaven's favor and govern all nations, spreading imperial teachings far and wide, leading both near and distant lands, extending benevolent grace even to remote frontier regions, and bestowing honors upon successive generations. Your kingdom of Ryukyu is located in the southern seas and holds rank among the feudatory states. The great-grandson of the Crown Prince of Zhongshan Kingdom, Shō Kei, has repeatedly sent envoys to pay court and has been unwavering in tribute. During the time when the Fujian frontier was in turmoil and sea bandits and land rebels were rampant, he steadfastly maintained his vassal loyalty, his respectful obedience became ever more manifest, and he was able to exhaust his loyal sincerity—this is deeply commendable. Now, in proper succession, he should inherit the throne and has memorialized requesting investiture. I consider that hereditary succession is the constant principle of family and state, and the conferring of noble rank is a great ceremony of the imperial court. I specially dispatch Chief Envoy Hai Bao, Compiler of the Hanlin Academy, and Deputy Envoy Xu Baoguang, Editor of the Hanlin Academy, bearing this edict to proceed and invest him as King of Zhongshan of the Ryukyu Kingdom. Let the ministers and officials of your kingdom, as well as the scholars and common people, assist your king in carefully cultivating virtuous government, increasingly encouraging sincere devotion, supporting the imperial house, and extending celebrations to ancestral worship. This is truly the boundless blessing of your maritime domain. Therefore, I issue this edict so that all may hear and know.

The 57th year of Kangxi, 8th month, [day]

Imperial Decree Bestowed
The Emperor issues an edict to the great-grandson of the Crown Prince of Zhongshan Kingdom of Ryukyu, Shō Kei: You dwell far in the ocean's corner and reverently maintain your tributary duties. As the heir apparent, you should properly succeed to the throne in order, but since you have not yet received imperial mandate, you dare not act on your own authority. Following established regulations, you have submitted a memorial requesting investiture. I am mindful that your family has for generations maintained vassal loyalty with sincere devotion

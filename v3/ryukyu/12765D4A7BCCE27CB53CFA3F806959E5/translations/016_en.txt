erected by the investiture envoys Xia Ziyang and Wang Shizhen in the thirty-fourth year of the Wanli era. Both sides are civilian houses, and many of the country's official documents are stored here. There is one bell with an inscription that reads: "The great ruler of the Ryukyu Kingdom, in the gengyin year of celebration, manifests the Dharma King's body, measures the great compassionate vow-ocean, and newly casts this great bell to donate to the Lower Tianfei Temple of this province. Above, it�ays for the eternal precious throne; below, it saves all sentient beings in the three realms. We humbly command Prime Minister An Qian to compose this inscription. The inscription says: The magnificent bell is cast and hung in the jeweled forest, striking through delusion and dreams, sincerely praying to Heaven's heart. Ruler and ministers unite in the Way, barbarians dare not invade. Manifesting the virtue of the craftsman Feng, inspiring the lament of Zhui Lei. For ten thousand generations, imperial grace flows through the wonderful Dharma sound. Donated on the first day of the first month of the dingthou year of Jingtai."

The Upper Tianfei Temple is located in Kumemura. According to the envoy records of Attendant Censor Xia Ziyang, this was built by Investiture Envoy Administrative Secretary Guo Rulin during the Jiajing era, though there are no other stone inscriptions to verify this. The temple is located in a winding alley, with the gate facing south and the shrine hall facing east. There are also two stone deities beside the gate. Entering the gate and ascending the paved path, there are several mu of space on both sides, surrounded by walls. In the center is the Tianfei shrine hall, with the Guandi shrine hall in one bay to the right, and monks' quarters to the left. Below the steps is a bell pavilion, and to the left of the main gate is a shrine hall facing upward, enshrining the Dragon God.

Inside the Tianfei hall are three plaques: "Virtue Established, Matching the Mysterious Vault" by investiture envoys Du Sance and Yang Lun from the sixth year of Chongzhen; "Life-giving Heavenly Fortune and Spirit" by investiture envoys Zhang Xueli and Wang Gai from the third year of Kangxi (guimao); and "Eternal Reliance on the Imperial Court" by investiture envoy Wang Ji from the twenty-second year. There is a twenty-three character couplet by Vice Envoy Lin Linzhuo, later inscribed "Respectfully composed by descendant nephew-grandson Linzhuo." Indeed,

The men in mixed robes of the second layer turn and emerge to the outer first layer, dancing with their hands and stamping their feet in circular motions as the rhythm. They rotate in sequence four or five times and descend, making this the fourth banquet.

The farewell banquet serves as the fifth banquet, with ceremonies as before. Additionally, one or two acts of national historical tales are added for entertainment.

The departure audience banquet serves as the sixth banquet, with ceremonies augmented by theatrical music as in the previous banquet. When the banquet ends, the king escorts the guests out of the palace to outside the Shureimun gate, where he further sets up a small seat in the crown prince's residence and personally offers three cups of wine as farewell.

The ship-viewing banquet serves as the seventh banquet. The king comes to the imperial envoys' lodge to hold a banquet with ceremonies as in the previous rites, formally presenting a handful of golden fans as farewell. When our ceremonial banquets are completed, we select an auspicious day to board the investiture ship, await favorable winds, and return to court to report back.

King Shō Kei of Chuzan dispatched accompanying ministers - the chief justice, royal uncles with the rank of Purple and Gold Grand Master, and others - bearing a memorial of gratitude, along with tribute goods loaded on the regular annual tribute ship, departing together with the investiture ship.

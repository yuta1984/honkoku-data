Celestial Envoys' Lodge
The Celestial Envoys' Lodge is about one ri distant from the Geion Pavilion and faces south. All the buildings are like Chinese government offices.
An outer fence surrounds all four sides, and within the fence there are four-bay gate houses on the east and west. Yellow册封 flags are mounted on poles,
and there are two octagonal drum pavilions on the left and right. Inside the main gate, there are six-bay service quarters on the east and west. On the ceremonial
gate is a plaque with the three characters "Tiantake Gate." This was inscribed by the envoy Xia Ziyang during the Wanli era of the former Ming dynasty, but
it has now been lost, so we ministers have rewritten it above. The front courtyard of the great hall spans several mu in area, and it is here that the accompanying ministers
perform their ceremonies. We ministers planted four large banyan trees on the left and right of the stone pathway. On the front eaves of the hall are
the four characters "Imperial Majesty Extends Far" in clerical script, inscribed by former envoys Zhang Xueli and Wang Gai, and the three characters "Hall of Imperial Commands" inscribed by Wang Ji and Lin Linzhao.
All of these we ministers have also rewritten.

The imperial edict states "The banquet gold given by this Ryukyu kingdom shall still be accepted by the envoys," which was respectfully received and is on record. Now, although King Shō Kei of that kingdom states "I respectfully attach the banquet gold to this memorial through accompanying ministers for presentation, earnestly requesting imperial grant of acceptance" and so forth, Hai Bao and Xu Baoguang, reverently embodying His Majesty's profound intent in specially selecting them, have not yet accepted it. Regarding the king's request for acceptance, there is no need for deliberation. On the first day of the ninth month, the imperial edict was received: "The banquet gold shall still be accepted by the envoys according to old precedent."

Minister Baoguang observes: The practice of former Ming envoys declining gold and not accepting it began with Chen Kan. Emperor Shizong still ordered Kan and others to accept it. Subsequently, though there were customary declinations, there were also cases where the declination was approved and tribute envoys were ordered to take it back. In our dynasty's three missions - Kangxi 2nd year (guimao), 22nd year (jihai), and the present one - all received imperial grace ordering acceptance. The means by which envoys are encouraged and rewarded is supreme. In the jihai mission, the Ryukyu king's memorial cited the old precedent of Zhang Xueli's restoration to original rank, petitioning for deliberation and promotion for Wang Ji, Lin Linzhuan and others. At that time, though maritime disturbances had been pacified, maritime prohibitions were still strict, the mission's journey was arduous and dangerous, so deliberation for promotion was appropriate. Now, however, peace has long prevailed, the realm within and without is one family, and moreover the sea spirits are compliant and obedient - traversing dangers is like walking on level ground. Such trivial comings and goings are the normal duty of ministers and subjects - what hardship is there to speak of? To seek promotion through empty words - I truly dare not follow this as precedent.

The people all wore uniforms of the same color - one boat in red, one in white, and one in black. A drum was placed in the center of each boat, beaten by small children in colorful clothing to keep rhythm. Two children in colorful garments at the front and back held long flags of five colors, while one person at the bow struck a gong in response to the drums. They all sang together the "Dragon Boat Peace" lyrics.

The meaning was that the Sacred Virtue extends far and wide, eternally enjoying peaceful governance, with the maritime nation receiving divine grace and dedicating loyalty in grateful response. When asked about the lyrics, they were roughly the same as those recorded by previous envoys. The boats circled left and right around the four shores, with several hundred male and female spectators watching closely. When the dragon boat performance ended, the king first bid farewell to the guests and returned to his residence, then continued the banquet at the Northern Palace, performing six theatrical pieces. A brief account follows:

The first was "The Elderly Couple's Congratulations to the Sage." An elderly couple led five or six descendants onto the stage, knelt, and spoke in the national language: "The current Sacred Son of Heaven has virtue higher than Yao and Shun, and his Way surpasses Tang and Wen. He illuminates the eight corners of the world with the brilliance of sun and moon, and through unification has achieved the prosperity of standardized vehicles and writing. Our king has long bathed in Sacred Grace and has newly received investiture. The Heavenly Envoy has graced us with his presence, and the entire nation rejoices. We humble servants, an elderly couple, were born and raised in this country and are 120 years old, both in good health. Our descendants number over 330, many of whom have entered official service and become officers. Our entire family has been blessed with good fortune. Among our descendants are those capable of singing and performing colorful dances, whom we lead in presenting longevity wishes." The elderly couple bowed twice and danced first, with lyrics: "The king's virtue is like the sea, father and mother of the people. Receiving investiture from Heaven, eternally firm as belt and grindstone." When the dance ended, groups of children in colorful clothing formed successive formations in one troupe.

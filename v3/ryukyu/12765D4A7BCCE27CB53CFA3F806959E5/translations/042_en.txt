Double Ninth Festival Banquet

Ryūtan (Dragon Pond) is located north of the royal palace and west of Engaku-ji Temple. It is less than half a ri in length and spans several dozen bu in width. The water flows clear and connects with the lotus pond in front of Engaku-ji Temple, formed by the confluence of streams flowing down from Zuisen. The southern shore is a sacred peak (kamitake) where banana trees grow densely, blocking out the sun and moon, casting shadows over the emerald pond. There are no other structures along the shore. The northern shore has a long embankment topped with stone walls that form ramparts, where all the great clans reside. Small bridges span east and west, with underground channels leading to the fields. On the eastern shore, a pointed wharf juts out into the middle of the pond, with flowering trees standing thick, surrounded by water on three sides. The Double Ninth Festival banquet is held for the dragon boat performances, with seating arranged on this wharf.

First, a wooden pavilion is erected on the wharf, decorated with multiple layers of colorful ornaments, with felt mats spread around the perimeter. The king escorts the guests to their seats. There are three styles of dragon boats, roughly similar to those seen in Fuzhou. The hull is over three jō in length, with twenty-eight oars.

reception

The imperial edict is received beneath this archway. The stone walls along the roadside gradually become higher, reaching eight to nine shaku. Outside the archway, on the left side of the road is Tenkai Temple, with the temple gate facing north and the Buddha hall facing west. To the southwest in front of the temple is the royal mausoleum, and within the surrounding walls across the street is Daimi Hall. Proceeding another half ri leads to Kankai Gate, which is the castle of the Chuzan Royal Palace. Located on a mountaintop, the whetstone castle walls extend three to four ri around the perimeter. Viewed from afar, it appears like a collection of skulls. This has been recorded since ancient times because of the resemblance in shape. The mountain's form and the palace sites originally face north-south, but since the route from Naha to Chuzan ascends from the western hill, all gates face west. On the stone cliffs outside the castle, "Dragon Hill" is carved on the left and "Tiger Peak" on the right. Each of the four sides of the castle has one gate. {{Interpolation: The front Kankai Gate faces west, the rear Keise Gate faces east, the left Water Gate faces south, and the right Kyukei Gate faces north}} Proceeding further through Kankai Gate to the base of the stone cliff is Zuisen (Auspicious Spring). Ascending the cliff, there is a gate facing northwest with a plaque reading "Zuisen." {{Interpolation: There are corridors on both left and right, with Left Wing Gate and Right Wing Gate providing access to the royal palace}} Proceeding further, there is a tower with a plaque reading "Water Clock" facing west. Further ahead is Kofuku Gate facing northwest, and further still is Hojin Gate with three gates standing side by side facing west. The royal hall has nine bays all facing the hall, with a large plaque bearing the four characters "Chuzan Sedo" (Chuzan Generations) displayed above the tower. This is the royal palace. The front hall's courtyard is square and spans several dozen mu in area. On the left is the South Tower facing north, on the right is the North Palace facing south with a plaque reading "Loyalty and Obedience Are Praiseworthy." All banquets for the imperial envoys are held in this hall. All the palace buildings are of sturdy construction with many pillars - twenty pillars are used for a single bay. There are no ornate decorations, nor are they particularly towering, because they are located on a mountaintop with frequent sea winds.

Ceremonial Protocols {{Interpolation: All follow those revised by former envoy Wang Ji}}

The day before the investiture, officials hang curtains and arrange decorations at the Imperial Envoy's Lodge and at places throughout the country where processions will pass.

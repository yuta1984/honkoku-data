[I] was blessed to receive imperial sacrificial rites for my great-grandfather, Chūzan King of Ryukyu Kingdom Shō Tei, and again blessed to receive imperial sacrificial rites for my father, King of Ryukyu Kingdom Shō Eki. Subsequently, on the twenty-sixth day of the seventh month, the imperial edict was proclaimed, investing subject Kei as Chūzan King and bestowing imperial gifts of python robes and other items, as well as colored robes and other objects for the queen. This is truly the special grace of the Celestial Court and the eternal glory of subject Kei. I humbly reflect that His Majesty's benevolence covers all without exception, extending grace to this small and weak nation. The envoys braved winds and waves, with hardships and perils none greater than these.

Since the envoys entered the kingdom, they have pacified and comforted this maritime realm, disciplined the military forces, and there is not a single subject or commoner in the entire nation who does not feel grateful reverence. However, what subject Kei deeply feels ashamed about is that this subject's kingdom borders the sea in wilderness, with nothing adequate to express respect. Therefore, during banquet occasions, gold was substituted for material gifts. Although I knew this was meager, it was indeed done following precedent. Yet this dishonored the envoys, who repeatedly declined, going back and forth three times, firmly upholding great righteousness and resolutely refusing to accept. The envoys maintained their ice-like integrity and self-restraint - truly having honor without disgrace, bringing glory to their role as envoys of the Sacred Dynasty. However, I reflect that the envoys endured hardships traveling through passes and traversing ten thousand li of wind and waves, truly for the sake of this subject personally. Without borrowing material objects to express respect and without proper ceremonial decorum, my heart secretly cannot find peace. When it came time for departure, I again specially dispatched officials including the Chief Legal Officer, Grand Master, and Chief Secretary to personally deliver the gold from previous banquets with earnest entreaty for acceptance, yet the envoys again sent it back. Their pure and incorruptible conduct can be said to be consistent from beginning to end. It is only that this humble subject cannot repay virtue or requite merit even one ten-thousandth, which is especially shameful. With deficiencies in old ceremonies, my sincere intentions cannot be expressed.

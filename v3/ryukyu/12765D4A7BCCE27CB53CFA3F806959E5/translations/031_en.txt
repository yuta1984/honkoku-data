[Minister] Baoguang notes: The bestowed goods and textiles from the former Ming dynasty varied according to the times. I record them below for reference. According to the Chuzan Seikan (Chronicle of the Middle Mountain), in the 14th year of Zhengtong (1449), the following were bestowed upon King Sho Shitatsu:
Four pieces of brocade (one red with decorative linked ball flowers, one red with decorative linked victory treasure-phase flowers, one yellow with cross-pattern flowers, one yellow with hundred-flower velvet brocade), six pieces of ramie silk (one red with gold-woven chest and back qilin design, one blue with lion design, one red with hidden eight treasures and heavenly flower cloud pattern, one green with cloud pattern, one plain blue, one green),
Eight pieces of gauze (one red with gold-woven chest and back bai ze design, one blue with qilin, one blue with hidden flowers, one red with hidden flower bone-branch cloud and eight treasures, one plain red, one blue, one green, one indigo), six pieces of thin silk (one red with gold-woven chest and back qilin, one blue, one plain red, one blue, one green, one indigo).
Bestowed upon the queen: two pieces of brocade (one blue with decorative cloud and phoenix, one yellow with hundred-flower velvet), four pieces of ramie silk (one red with gold-woven chest and back bai ze, one blue with hidden flower bone-branch cloud, one green with hidden heavenly flower eight treasures cloud, one plain blue), four pieces of gauze (one red with gold-woven chest and back bai ze, one green with hidden flower bone-branch cloud, one plain red, one blue), four pieces of thin silk (one with gold-woven chest and back leopard design, one plain blue, one green, one indigo).

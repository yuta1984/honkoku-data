Thus it is:
In the fifty-eighth year of Kangxi, the cyclical year ji-hai, on the sacrificial day ding-mao, exceeding the first day ren-yin of the sixth month,
The Emperor dispatched Chief Envoy Hai Bao, Compiler of the Hanlin Academy, and Deputy Envoy Xu Baoguang, Editor of the Hanlin Academy, to invest the Kingdom of Ryukyu,

Proclaiming a sacrificial ceremony to the spirit of the late King Sho Tei of Chuzan, Kingdom of Ryukyu, saying: "I, governing all nations with care, treat the interior and exterior as one body. Even those in the distant frontier lands all receive abundant grace. How much more so when loyalty was already sincere during life—thus the bestowal of compassion becomes ever more generous after death.

Just when one might say your centenary years were not yet exhausted, how could one foresee that news of your passing would reach us from afar, causing deep sorrow in our heart. We specially order this sacrificial ceremony of condolence. Alas! Serving as a protective screen in distant lands, maintaining the loyalty of a vassal from beginning to end.

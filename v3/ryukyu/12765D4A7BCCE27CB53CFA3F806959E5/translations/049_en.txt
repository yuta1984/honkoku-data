By imperial edict, your subject Kei was invested as Chūzan King, and graciously received gifts of python-patterned silk and other items, as well as colored silk and other goods for the queen consort. Your subject Kei led all officials in prostrating with dance and kowtowing to express gratitude for this grace. Additionally, I petitioned the envoys to allow the imperial edict to remain as a treasured heirloom of the kingdom. The envoys examined the scrolls from previous investitures and graciously permitted them to be left with your subject, which I treasure together as one collection.

I humbly reflect that the Sacred Dynasty extends caring protection and gentle governance, encompassing all like Heaven and Earth. How can your subject Kei and others not be deeply moved with gratitude? For this reason, I have specially dispatched accompanying subjects: Chief Legal Officer and Royal Uncle-in-Law Shō Ryūyoku, Purple-Gold Rank Tei Junsoku, Envoy Yō Tenyū, Interpreter Sai Bunka, Vice-Interpreters Tei Genryō and Sai Yō, and others to carry memorial documents and local tribute to the capital to humbly express gratitude for Heavenly grace. I humbly hope that Your Imperial benevolence will graciously examine these sincere feelings from below. Your subject Kei is overwhelmed with fervent reverence and anxiety. I respectfully submit this memorial to report.

Tribute Items:
Two golden cranes (with complete silver bases), One set of armor (complete with arm guards and leg guards), Two gold-hilted sheathed swords

Reception and Welcoming
The dragon palanquin landed at the wei hour (1-3 PM), and all officials led the way to the lodge where the imperial edicts were respectfully installed.
After completing the ceremonies, they entered for audience in order. The legal officials, royal uncles, purple-gold ministers, and purple-cap officials formed
one group and performed three kowtows. The celestial envoys stood to receive them and answered with bows. The ear-and-eye officials, senior deliberation ministers, and middle
deliberation ministers formed one group and performed three kowtows. The celestial envoys stood to receive them and answered with clasped hands. The Naha officials,
historiographers, attendant inspectors, record officials, ceremonial officials, and chief interpreters formed one group and performed three kowtows. The
celestial envoys sat to receive them and answered with raised hands. Subsequently, on the first and fifteenth of each month and every fifty days, the king dispatched legal officials,
royal uncles and others to the lodge for a formal courtesy visit. The celestial envoys all descended from their seats, and for responses they all stood up.
On the second and sixteenth of every month, the celestial envoys also dispatched envoys to the royal palace for reciprocal inquiries.

I respectfully submit the banquet gold returned multiple times - four sealed packages totaling 192 taels - attached to this memorial, dispatching accompanying ministers Legal Officer and Royal Uncle-in-law Shō Ryūyoku, Purple-Gold Grand Master Tei Junsoku and others to carry and present it, earnestly requesting His Imperial Majesty to grant that the envoys accept it. I cannot overcome my utmost terror and intense feelings. I respectfully present this memorial to be heard.

The Ministry of Rites respectfully submits: Regarding the matter that the great ceremony of receiving investiture has been completed, and earnestly requesting to maintain old precedent to reward the envoys. We ministers deliberated and determined that Ryukyu King Shō Kei memorialized stating: "The imperially dispatched chief envoy Hanlin Academy Compiler Hai Bao, vice envoy Hanlin Academy Editor Xu Baoguang and others visited our humble kingdom and invested subject Kei as king. During banquet occasions, gold was substituted for material gifts. The envoys repeatedly declined, going back and forth three times, firmly upholding great righteousness and resolutely refusing to accept. However, this humble subject cannot repay virtue or requite merit even one ten-thousandth. I respectfully submit two sealed packages of banquet gold totaling 192 taels, attached to this memorial through accompanying ministers Legal Officer and Royal Uncle-in-law Shō Ryūyoku and others for presentation, earnestly requesting imperial grant of acceptance" and so forth. Upon investigation, in the 23rd year of Kangxi, when envoys Hanlin Academy Compiler Wang Ji and others invested the Ryukyu King, the banquet gold given to them was not accepted by them. When the king of that country memorialized requesting [acceptance], our Ministry deliberated and replied that we still would not permit their acceptance. This was formally memorialized and received imperial approval.

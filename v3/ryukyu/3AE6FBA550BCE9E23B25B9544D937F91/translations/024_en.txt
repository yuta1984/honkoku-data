Kin magiri has eight villages. To the east it faces the sea, to the southwest it connects with the three magiri of Nago, Onna, and Misato of Nakagami, and to the north it borders Kushi magiri through mountain peaks. The topography is long from east to west and very narrow from north to south. Though arable land is limited, the soil is fertile. It is about twelve ri and twenty-nine chō from Naha.

The coastline has capes and bays extending in and out, with Cape Kin in the center protruding far into the sea. Though there are Ginoza Port, Kanna Port, etc., they are not convenient for anchoring due to shallow bottoms with many rocks.

In Kin Village there is a cave over one chō in length. Even during daytime, one cannot enter without illuminating with torches.

Nanoka-hama (Seven-day Beach) is located on the southern coastline, where the sand is so deep it covers one's ankles, making walking difficult. Hence this name. Kochiya-sehara is at the border with Kushi magiri, becoming a flat sandy area when the tide recedes. To the northwest one can view the various mountains of Kushi magiri, and to the southeast it faces the three islands of Ikeijima, Takarashima, and Henzajima of Yonashiro magiri. The scenery is most beautiful.

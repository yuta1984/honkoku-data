Kushi magiri has nineteen villages. To the east it faces the sea, to the south it borders Kin magiri, and to the northwest it obliquely connects with the four magiri of Nago, Haneji, Ōgimi, and Kunigami through mountain ranges. The topography extends north-south and contracts east-west. It is about eighteen ri and twenty-three chō from Naha.

Mount Kushi and Mount Henoko tower at the border of the three magiri of Ōgimi, Nago, and Haneji, while Mount Matera rises at the border with Kin magiri. All are lofty and steep.

The coastline has capes and bays extending in and out, with Cape Henoko to the south and Cape Abe to the north. Between them forms one great bay, which is called Ōura Port. The bay entrance has a shallow bottom, making it inconvenient for ships to enter and exit. Although there are many other bays and harbors, they are all small and narrow, suitable for mooring boats

The fifteen villages are: Mawashi-machi, Hatayama, Kawasamu, Mizukawa, Kinjo, Onaka, Momohara, Tōgura, Torigobori, Akada, Sakiyama, Gibo, Akahira, Teishirajitsugi, and Kyuba-gawa. There are over 4,950 households with a population of over 24,400. The topography is based on mountains and valleys, with uneven elevation. The houses generally line the mountainsides like scales, surrounded by stone walls. Roads extend in all four directions, making it a prosperous area second only to Naha.

The castle was built by cutting into the mountain, with oyster stone stacked to form the outer walls. The perimeter is nine chō. The main hall is located on high ground in the center. The palace building has two stories, eight bays from north to south, and eleven gates. Its position faces west. There is a clear spring within the castle called Zuisen. Currently it serves as the garrison of the Okinawa Detachment of the Kumamoto Garrison.

There is a market in Machibata village, where commerce is fairly prosperous.

To the east of the market there is a pond called Ryūtan, with a circumference of about three chō. It is connected to Benzaiten Pond. Along both sides of the pond are the Shuri government office, police station, middle school, Nakagusuku residence, and others. Ancient pines and various trees grow luxuriantly around the pond's edge, their reflections inverted in the pond water. It is especially a scenic spot for moon viewing.

The entire territory consists of three major islands and many smaller islets forming the nation. The large island in the north is called Okinawa Island, and the various islands scattered in its nearby waters—Kerama, Kume, Iheya, Ie, Tonaki, Aguni, Tori-shima, Tsuken, Kudaka, and others—are attached to it. The two major islands in the south, Miyako and Yaeyama, are called the Ryosen Islands (Both Advanced Islands). The various islands arranged in their nearby waters—Irabu, Kurima, Tarama, Ogami, Ikema, Minna, Taketomi, Hateruma, Hatoma, Iriomote, Kohama, Kuroshima, Aragusuku, Yonaguni, and others—belong to them. Yonaguni Island is located about fifty ri southwest of Iriomote Island. It is not very far from Taiwan. Among these, Okinawa Island is the largest. Therefore, it serves as the main island, and its name is used as the general term for all the islands.

The mountain ranges originate from the two mountains of Hedo and Nishime at the extreme north of Kunigami, forming coiled connections, extending and moving to Nakagami, winding and undulating, rushing to Shimajiri, crossing to Kerama, Kume, and Miyako, proceeding to Yaeyama, rising again and ending in the southwest.

Among the high and steep mountains, there are Katsuudake and Onnadake in Kunigami, Bengadake in Nakagami, and Omotodake and Komidake in Yaeyama. These are the major ones. In addition, there are very many mountain peaks everywhere.

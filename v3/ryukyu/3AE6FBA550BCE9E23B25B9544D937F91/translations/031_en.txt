and rich, producing the finest sugar. There are over 960 households with a population of over 4,430. It is about twenty-three ri from Naha.

The products are sugar, sweet potatoes, potato liquor, miscellaneous grains, fish and shellfish, etc.

Iheya Island is located in the sea about ten ri northwest of Nakijin magiri. It has many mountains and forests but few plains. It is divided into five islands: Iheya, Izena, Noho, Gushikawa, and Yanaha. There are over 710 households with a population of over 4,920. It is about thirty ri from Naha.

Iheya Island has a circumference of about four ri and twenty-six chō. It is also called Mount Hakabe. King Shō En, the ancestor of the Shō dynasty, is said to have originated from this island.

Izena Island is over one ri from Iheya, with a circumference of about two ri and eighteen chō. There are castle ruins in Izena village, called Izena Castle. Mount Kamiyama is in Serikaku village. Although the trees grow luxuriantly, the local people fear the curse of the mountain god and do not cut them down.

The area between Izena and Iheya has particularly severe irregularities on the seabed. Therefore, raging waves create countercurrents, making ferry crossings extremely dangerous.

Noho, Gushikawa, Yanaha, and others are all small islands with circumferences of no more than one ri.

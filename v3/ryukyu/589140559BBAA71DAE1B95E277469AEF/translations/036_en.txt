Those who receive grants pass down their stipends through generations, with the eldest son inheriting. The fiefs granted to those who attain rank through their own merit are immediately removed when they leave office. Each year they collect two-thirds of what the land produces. For example, if one qing of farmland produces one hundred koku of rice, the farmer collects fifty koku and the stipend holder collects fifty koku. Of the stipend holder's fifty koku, there are over ten koku for public expenses, miscellaneous costs, etc. Excluding this, they actually collect over thirty koku. Roughly calculated, this amounts to two-thirds. The quantities of chickens, pigs, and firewood are collected according to circumstances, using the amount of rice koku as the standard. Among the people of those fiefs who take up official positions, the amounts are determined according to their official rank. There are sixteen Kokusō (chief ministers) and Hōshi (legal officials), eleven Purple-Gold Great Masters, ten Purple-Cap Officials, four Yellow-Cap Officials, and two Red-Cap Officials, all rotating monthly.

The Kokusō's fief is one prefecture (note: or two prefectures), with a stipend of six hundred koku. Those with merit receive additional seven hundred, eight hundred, or nine hundred koku, stopping at one thousand koku. Hereditary heirs and grandsons are granted fiefs of one prefecture with stipends of three hundred koku. For great-grandsons, differences are made according to their merit.

Hōshi receive fiefs of one prefecture with stipends of four hundred koku. There is a precedent of hereditary stipends. Heirs and grandsons are granted fiefs of one prefecture with stipends of eighty koku. For great-grandsons, differences are made according to merit.

Kokukyu (royal relatives by marriage) receive fiefs of one prefecture (note: or one county) with stipends of eighty koku, or one hundred or two hundred koku, all granted according to merit. Hereditary stipends grant stipends and fiefs according to the magnitude of merit, extending to children and grandchildren.

Purple-Cap Officials receive fiefs of one prefecture (note: or one county) with stipends of thirty koku, or forty or fifty koku, stopping at eighty koku. All are granted according to the magnitude of merit. Hereditary stipends make differences according to merit.

Shihin (protocol officials) and Jimoku officials (intelligence officials) also receive fiefs of one prefecture with stipends of eighty koku. Tenhō (treasure keepers), Shikei (judicial officials), Kanpaku

片帽 (Flat Cap)
The flat caps are all made of black silk. They have a flat top and the lower brim is made with six ridges. This is a hat worn at home during cold weather. Medical officials, musicians, those who serve tea in the royal palace, and those who shave their hair like monks all wear these.

笠 (Sedge Hat)
Most sedge hats are made from wheat stalks. There are also leather hats. Black lacquer is applied to the outside, and the inside is painted vermillion.

短簪 (Short Hairpin)
Short hair-binding hairpins are about three to four sun in length. Those who already wear caps and have removed the hair from the top of their head insert these. They have flower-shaped heads and cylindrical shafts. There are also square and hexagonal shaft varieties. Gold is most precious, gold heads with silver shafts come next, silver comes after that. Copper is considered the lowest grade.

長簪 (Long Hairpin)
Long hairpins are over one shaku in length. Women and children who wear large chignons insert these. These are also divided into three grades of gold, silver, and copper to distinguish social status. The hairpins of women from common households are all made of tortoiseshell.

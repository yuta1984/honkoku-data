Royal Consorts of Previous Generations

The previous diagram in the "Chuzan Enkakushi" by the former envoy Wang Ji has a somewhat disordered sequence. Now I have investigated and corrected it.

All the kings are called "Shinshu" (Divine Lords). However, only the four lords Nei, Ho, Ken, and Shitsu are called "Sonrei" (Honored Spirits). Additionally, their posthumous names are added to their titles. Nei is called "Koo," Ho is called "Sosho," Ken is called "Shuei," and Shitsu is called "Choko."

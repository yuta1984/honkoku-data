The Buddhist hall has one central bay for enshrining Buddha, with left and right sections like side chambers that store the spirit tablets of former kings who have been removed to the ancestral shrine (tao). The right gallery in front of the Buddhist hall serves as a spirit hall, with two halls arranged side by side. Each hall has three bays, all facing south. The upper hall has three niches, with the central one for Sho En Ryukeiun-kun, which is his posthumous name. He is considered the founding ancestor of the royal line. The left niche houses Sho Shitsu, the great-great-grandfather of the current king. The right niche houses Sho Tei, the great-grandfather of the current king.

The lower hall has three niches for Sho Shin, who was the son of Sho En. He is regarded as the Taiso (Grand Ancestor) of the royal line. Together with the founding ancestor Sho En, they are both considered permanent tablets (bu-tao) that are never removed. Therefore, they both occupy the central niches. The left niche houses Sho Eki, the father of the current king. The right niche houses Sho Jun, the grandfather of the current king. The fact that the father occupies the left and the grandfather the right reflects the established positions of cho and mu generations, without concern for equal status.

Inside Tenno-ji Temple, there are also spirit tablets. The Buddhist hall faces south with three bays, the center enshrining Buddha. The left bay contains two spirit tablets. One reads "귀진 Sho Shoku Divine Position," who was the father of founding ancestor Sho En. The other reads "Kijin Sho Kyu Divine Position." Sho Kyu was the father of King Sho Ho and the third son of Sho Gen. Both were fathers of kings but never became kings themselves, so they are separately enshrined here. The two tablets nearby are for royal consorts. The four tablets in the right bay are all for royal consorts.

Inside Tenkai-ji Temple is the spirit tablet of Sho I, who was the father of King Sho Nei. The temple houses only female tablets, serving royal consorts and the king's sisters. Those who married out and have family shrines may also be enshrined here.

After Crown Prince Sho Eki died and was first buried, his spirit tablet was placed in the Crown Prince's residence. Male and female officials wore mourning clothes and performed daily ritual weeping. After one hundred days, the tablet was moved to Tenkai-ji Temple. Men and women also burned incense and silk offerings daily. After the mourning period ended and three years passed with the ancestral enshrinement, the inner palace women were no longer permitted to participate in the ritual ceremonies. The rituals for all previous kings followed this same pattern.

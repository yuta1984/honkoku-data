(Note: Children from Naha, when they serve and reach the position of treasury official, then begin to receive stipends. Below this rank, all have no stipends.)

The above covers the numbers of official stipends at Kume Village's Chinese quarters.

From Jimoku officials downward, large and small officials with merit have hereditary stipends and fiefs passed down to their children and grandchildren. All have differences made according to merit.

　　Farmland

All farmland is cultivated and planted in the ninth and tenth months, with harvest completed in the fifth month. For the fiefs granted to each official, all personally visit their lands to oversee cultivation and harvest. There are officials, or sometimes children and younger relatives who supervise this. In the tenth and eleventh months, green seedlings all emerge from the water, and seedlings are thinned and transplanted. This is done during heavy rains, when thunder roars and develops, earthworms cry out, and the climate is like spring. North winds occasionally arise, but are not particularly severe or bitter. In late November, one Ka'etsu-sha (inspector) and two Sasshin-ki officials are dispatched to tour the villages separately and encourage agriculture. They return only after more than a month. In the sixth month, great hurricanes frequently occur, rain flies horizontally from the sea, and all fruits fall. This is considered normal every year. Unless the harvest is completed early, there will certainly be much suffering from crops being uprooted. Therefore, in that country they plow in autumn, plant in winter, weed in spring, and harvest in summer - partly to take advantage of rainfall, and partly to avoid the harm of typhoons and hurricanes. The year-round warmth should theoretically allow double cropping, but after the sixth month all fields are left fallow and uncultivated for this reason.

　　Calendar

The calendar follows the official court calendar. When tribute envoys reach the capital, they must wait for the calendar distribution on the first day of the tenth month, bring it back to reach the country, but half a year has already passed. Therefore, the people of the country establish a Calendar Interpreter official of the seventh rank, who calculates in advance and creates calendars for practical use. Written on the calendar face it says: "The Calendar Official of Ryukyu Kingdom respectfully follows the imperial edict and creates the selection..."

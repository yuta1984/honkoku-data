　　　(the blade) is bad. Regarding tying with string,
　　　if tied too tightly, the bark will
　　　peel off. That said,
　　　if too loose, it won't attach. Simply maintain

　　　which is considered good.

　　　Wrap with bamboo bark like this.
　　　However, during the rainy season, take care
　　　that water does not enter the cut
　　　surface. If water gets in, the cut surface will
　　　be damaged, and the string will also rot,
　　　or the cut surface will be damaged
　　　by exposure to the sun.
　　　Also, grafting is sometimes done
　　　from mid-May until early July.
　　　This is called "doyo-tsugi" (midsummer grafting). At this time,
　　　cutting the rootstock is not good
　　　because the cut surface is affected by heat and the tree's
　　　vitality declines and becomes damaged.

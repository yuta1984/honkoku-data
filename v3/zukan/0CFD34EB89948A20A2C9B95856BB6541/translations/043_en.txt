It is said that one forgets to return home when captivated by the beautiful scenery beneath the flowers. These five volumes show forms in illustrations and describe colors in words. Those who plant azaleas for appreciation should go out to their flower gardens with this book and compare the names with what they see - even after the flowers have scattered and withered, there are still many things worth seeing. It inspires the interest of the four seasons, makes the heart honest without evil thoughts, and naturally plants the precious seeds of Buddhist enlightenment. Might one also forget to return to the mundane world?

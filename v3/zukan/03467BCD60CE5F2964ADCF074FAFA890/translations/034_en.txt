Tōyaku (Swertia)　Abundant in sunny places in mountains, less common in deep mountains. It is a small herb. In spring it produces seedlings; the leaves that first touch the ground are broad, like purslane leaves but with pointed tips. In autumn it sends up a central stem with opposite leaves. The leaves attached to the stem are narrow, like small carnation leaves. Length about one sun, width about one bu. The surface is deep green, while the back and stem are purple. Height is less than one shaku; thin specimens are 2-3 sun tall. In the eighth and ninth months, branches divide from the stem head and produce several flowers. Size about six bu, six petals with pointed tips, white with beautiful purple vertical stripes. There are also blue-colored varieties. Both produce fine seeds after flowering. In winter both seedlings and all parts die. The seeds fall and grow naturally. This herb is extremely bitter - no matter how many times it is boiled and extracted, the bitter taste does not diminish, hence it is called senburi (thousand boils).

　《Baitun Shishō (Plum Mound Poetry Collection) - Three Volumes Complete, Total Nine Books》
The master's reputation for talent has been widely known since his youth. Needless to say, he is a learned Confucian scholar, and with his surplus energy from studying classics and histories, he is called a great poet of the generation in the poetry world. Though he excels in all poetic forms, he is particularly rich in long epic works, reaching places where ordinary poets could never aspire. Those who aspire to poetry study must see this poetry collection to gain the benefit of improving their own poetic talent and understanding the master's scholarship.

《Historical Poetry Study Selection - First Edition 10 Books, Second Edition 7 Books》
Although there are many books on poetry study convenient for children today, all excuse themselves with simplicity while actually specializing in pursuing profit, so scholars regret that even after purchasing everything, it is still insufficient. Now this book prioritizes convenience regardless of the number of volumes, and for familiar phrases and prosodic foundations from the Tang dynasty through the Qing, not to mention complete works of great masters, Peiwen Yunfu, Circular Mechanism and Living Methods, it extracts from various philosophers and histories those that best suit current trends - elegant, graceful, fresh, antique, profound, bold, rhythmic, and meaningful - applying pronunciation guides. The examples collect ancient and modern masterpieces that are popular among both Japanese and Chinese, the topics begin with seasonal daily matters and broadly extend to astronomy, geography, birds, beasts, plants and trees. At the end of each section, classical allusions are especially cited, and numerous excellent lines and couplets from ancient poets that match the theme are searched out, so not only quatrains but also regulated verse can be learned from this. The small booklets circulated so far are truly like one hair from nine oxen, and no matter how many books may be published hereafter, they cannot exceed what is in this book. For beginners with this book, even if Li Bai, Du Fu, Su Shi, and Lu You were to teach orally and by hand all at once, how could they surpass this? For regulated verse, there is separately something called "Couplet Mastery."

《Poetic Phrase Couplet Mastery - Complete Five Books》

There are absolutely no books for beginners to learn regulated verse, and even if there are any, they are insufficient as stepping stones. Now this book divides into five categories of four seasons and miscellaneous, setting up topics from today's daily life that are close at hand, extracting numerous antithetical phrases from complete works of great masters since the Tang that suit current trends - novel, elegant, gorgeous, warm, with deep prosodic charm - while applying pronunciation guides. The examples enumerate without regard to quantity all the most outstanding masterpieces of ancient and modern times, and since all five- and seven-character quatrains with front and rear parallelism are included, five- and seven-character quatrains should also be learned from this. For prosodic foundations, there was previously something called "Regulated Verse Rhyme Box," which generally uses the same vocabulary as this. Where this book collects ancient and modern antithetical phrases is not what is called an "eight-bushel comparison." Therefore, once the volume is opened, regulated verse will be completed within three steps.

《Tama no O Kuribun (Jeweled Cord Parsing) - Complete Five Books》

This book deeply considers and corrects the differences in the example patterns of teniwoha (Japanese particles) cited in "Kotoba no Tama no O," so it is a beneficial book that those studying classical learning should never part from their side.

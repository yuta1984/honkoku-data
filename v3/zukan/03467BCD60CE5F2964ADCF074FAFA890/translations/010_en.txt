Hanashōbu (Iris ensata) A variety of the same species as shōbu that produces flowers. There are types that grow both in water and on land.
　The leaf shape resembles shōbu but lacks luster and is lighter in color. Around the fourth and fifth months,
　it extends stems and produces flowers. The form is like kakitsubata. Most have three petals.
　There are also those with six petals. Three petals are large and three petals are small. There are also
　those where all six petals are large, and some with five petals. All have flower petals whose tips hang
　downward. There are also those that extend straight to the left and right without drooping. Unlike the stems of kakitsubata and hana-
　ayame, the stem bears small leaves, and from between these leaves
　it divides into branches that bear flowers. Flower colors include purple, light purple, white, variegated,
　and calico patterns - there are many varieties. All are planted in residential gardens to appreciate the flowers.

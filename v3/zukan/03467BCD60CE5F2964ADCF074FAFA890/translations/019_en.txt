Kirinso (Sedum)　In spring, new shoots grow from old roots. They grow in clusters from a single root, about one shaku in height. The form resembles benkei-so but smaller, with coarse serrated edges on the leaves and pale green color, and there are also varieties with small serrations and deep green color. Both types produce clustered yellow flowers at the stem tips around the fourth to fifth months. The flowers have five petals with pointed tips, resembling sute-gusa flowers but larger. The size is four to five bu. The stems are thick but very weak and fall over in all directions. However, it is a plant with very strong vitality that readily puts out roots even when cut and left abandoned. Its strength is like that of benkei-so and sute-gusa varieties.

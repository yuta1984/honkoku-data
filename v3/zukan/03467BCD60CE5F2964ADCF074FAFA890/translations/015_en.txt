Kingingka　Abundant in mountains and fields, it twines around trees and spreads, producing leaves in opposite pairs at each node.
　The shape is oval with pointed tips. New leaves emerge in spring. Some resemble chrysanthemum leaves, and some
　have round leaves. All variations grow from the same root system and are not separate species. In the fourth and fifth months, flowers
　bloom among the leaves. They are fragrant. Two flowers per stem, four flowers per node bloom on the same day. Length over one sun, the base is thin
　and tubular, the end deeply split into two petals. The upper petal is broad and shallowly
　divided into four parts. The lower petal is narrow and undivided. Inside are five white stamens. When in bud, they are pale
　pink, when opened they are white, and after some days they turn yellow and fall. On one branch, yellow and white
　complement each other. Hence it is called Kingin (gold-silver) flower. In Tosa Province it is called Suibana. There is one variety where the flowers
　turn red when they bloom. In both cases, after flowering, two round fruits form on one stem. One is large and
　one is small, ripening to a black color. There is also one variety from Higo Province where the leaves are large and thick. The flowers are also
　large.

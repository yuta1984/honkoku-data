Globe amaranth　Cultivated in homes for flower appreciation. Originally a foreign species. Seeds are sown after the spring equinox.
　Easy to grow. The leaf shape is like persimmon leaves, elongated and
　soft. Length is three to four sun, width about one sun. Leaves are opposite. Where leaves attach to the
　stem is thick and swollen, pale red in color, resembling the stem of Achyranthes (Inokozuchi). Height is
　two to three shaku. In summer, branches divide between the leaves, bearing one flower at the tip. Well-nourished plants may
　bear three flowers. Purple-red color with fine petals. The shape resembles yangmei (Japanese bayberry) and is
　large. Initially round, but gradually becomes longer as it matures, reaching over one sun in length.
　Even after the plant roots wither in winter, the flower color does not change. Seeds form
　within the petals. They are elongated. Grows well when cultivated. There is one variety with pale red flowers. There are also
　white-flowered varieties. All have the same shape.

《Shigin Shugi (Poetic Rhyme Pearl Collection) - Revised by Master Kintai, Complete 8 Books, Thin Paper Edition Complete 2 Books》
This book was compiled by Yu Zhaochunting of the Qing dynasty. Using "Peiwen Yunfu" as the original text, where there are omissions, it supplements with other books. From character dictionaries and rhyme books, naturally, to "Shimon Ruiju," "Geibun Ruiju," and even categorical books like "Enkan Ruikan" and "Kakuchi Kyōgen," it records classical sources and historical anecdotes. Moreover, it places rhyme characters first after the rhyme foundations. For example, in the "yi dong" rhyme, after the usual rhyme foundations like "castle east," "house east," "peach garden east," etc., it uses that "east" character as the initial character, or types like "eastern mountain," "eastern sea," "Dongfang Shuo," etc., up to five and seven characters. Thus dividing rhyme characters above and below, it prioritizes speed of reference. What it contains - classics, histories, philosophers, and literary collections - lacks nothing. It provides freedom in searching rhyme foundations and seeking familiar phrases and historical anecdotes, making it a quick reference for rhyme books. Previously when "Rhyme Repository Corner" was published, gentlemen from all directions treasured it. However, occasionally there are still omissions. Where it omits, this book contains; what this book abbreviates, "Corner" includes. Thus this compilation and "Corner" are like wheels, like wings. When both books are available, there is no need to regret the absence of "Peiwen Yunfu." How much less would other books be needed? Truly for elegant and talented individuals, national scholars, calligraphers, painters, and even renga poets - all those with such aspirations - during flowery mornings and moonlit evenings, rainy nights and snowy dawns, or at wine banquets and celebratory feasts, sightseeing and traveling, this is a precious book and treasure mirror they cannot lack in their sleeves for even a moment.

《Nijishin-den (Biographies of Disloyal Retainers) - Reprint of Tang Edition, Small Format, Complete 8 Books》
This book concerns retainers who for generations received stipends from the Ming dynasty and basked in its benevolent favors, yet pursued extreme luxury, or monopolized political power to harm worthy ministers and oppress the people. Later they forgot their highest favor, deceived their lord, sold out their country, communicated with enemies, and finally used treacherous cunning to serve the Qing and temporarily achieve success and advancement. Therefore, both heaven and humanity despised them. However, when heaven was settled and the Qing lord achieved unification, such people were said to have destroyed the great moral principles of the realm, so some were executed, some exiled, some permanently imprisoned, some stripped of stipends and reduced to hunger and thirst. Moreover, court historians were commanded to compose their biographies in detail as warnings to serve as moral mirrors for later generations. Therefore, when great masters from all directions read this once, all their pent-up feelings clear like the first clearing after long rains - truly an indescribably delightful rare book.

Plantain (Ōbako)　Abundant along roadsides. In spring it produces shoots from old roots. It grows spoon-shaped leaves with only vertical veins, with the broad end about 2 sun long and over 1 sun wide. From late summer through autumn, it separately produces small round stems between the leaves. These are 5-6 sun long, forming spikes from the middle, with fine seeds clustering together. The shape is as shown in the illustration. Those from Ushū and Ezo provinces have narrow leaves with hair. There is one variety called Ryūkyū-ōbako with short leaves over 1 sun long and about 1 sun wide, some of which are round. They are thick and deep green, and when cultivated develop wrinkled patterns, hence also called shikami-obako. The spikes are about 2 sun long. There is one large-leafed variety called Tō-ōbako, Chōsen-ōbako, and Oranda-ōbako. The leaves are about 1 shaku long and 6 sun wide, with spikes reaching 3 shaku in length. The seeds are also large. There is one variety with branched spikes, ranging from 3-5 branches to over 10 branches. The leaves are the same as ordinary ones. It is incorrect for cultivators to call this futamata-no-ōbako.

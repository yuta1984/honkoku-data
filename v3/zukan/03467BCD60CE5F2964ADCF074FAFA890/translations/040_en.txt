Although the Jikkatsu-hō method is convenient, it lacks level tones, lacks elegant rhythm, and is insufficient in familiar phrases. Other recent publications such as Shiin Gan'ei, Idō Ben'in-fu Ichigū, Shiin Shukei, Tōji-in, Shogaku Ken'in, Ryōin Benran, and similar works all have their advantages and disadvantages, making it difficult to manage without having all these books at hand. This present book is like a dictionary that dissects and incorporates all these aforementioned works, and furthermore, not only includes rare expressions and elegant phrases, but also provides detailed information on alternate rhyme usage and common applications, collected from the works of ancient and modern masters as well as poetry discussions and essays, creating a golden and jade-like compilation - truly an unprecedented selection. Since the emergence of introductory poetry books, this can be called an excellent work without comparison. It will be published within this year.

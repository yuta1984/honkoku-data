Dead-nettle　Found abundantly in bamboo groves. Also grows beside roads and in shady places.
　From the eighth month, it produces shoots from old roots. It has square stems with opposite leaves that are round with pointed
　tips and serrated edges. During winter the stems are not thick, with a height of five to six sun. In spring, during the second and third
　months, it reaches a height of one to two shaku, and the stem ends become thick. Flowers open between the leaves.
　They grow in clusters at each node. Seven to eight bu long, like wearing a hat and
　playing a shakuhachi flute. Hence it has the name "priest's hood flower." Pale pink in color, and there are also white flowers.
　Children cut the stems, remove the leaves, leave flowers on two nodes, make a hole in the center of the stem,
　thread a thin bamboo branch through it, and blow with their mouths to make it spin
　around for amusement. Hence it has the name "pinwheel." In summer the stems wither
　and die. The roots do not die.

Senkwa (Hirugao - bindweed)　Most abundant in fields and plains. Once it grows, thin white roots spread underground and flourish. In spring, shoots emerge from old roots. Leaves are alternate, long and pointed, with small double points at the base. There are also some that are short with four points at the base. The stems spread and twine around plants and trees. In summer months, flowers open between the leaves. They open after the hour of the Dragon (around 8 AM) and wither by evening. There are two varieties: light pink and white. The shape resembles morning glories but is smaller. The calyx has short, broad leaves flanking it, differing from morning glory calyxes which are long and narrow with five divisions. There is one variety called ō-hirugao with large leaves and large flowers. There are two varieties: light pink and white. In Sanshū it is called choku-bana (Chinese name: xuán cài). Another variety that grows in sandy soil near seashores and lake shores is called hama-hirugao. It is also known as katsu-hō-bana, amefuri-bana, hama-chi-bana, gau-zuru (Echizen), hebi-asagao (Sagami), and afuhi-kazura (Hyōgo). The leaf shape is nearly round and thick, about one inch in size. The vines are not long and the flowers are of ordinary size.

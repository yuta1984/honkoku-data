There is one variety that is domestically produced called Tenmoku White Atractylodes. It is said to come from Kawagoe in Musashi Province. The leaves resemble those of domestically produced Atractylodes lancea, having five or three pointed tips, with pale color and soft texture. They are broader and larger than the leaves of the Chinese variety. The roots are extremely large and fat, with white flesh that is softer than Atractylodes lancea.

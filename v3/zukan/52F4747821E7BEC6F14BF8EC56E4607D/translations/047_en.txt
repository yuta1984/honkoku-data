Kashiwa hen
　Yellow hen (ōshikei)
　Its nature and taste are the same as the rooster, good for elderly and weak people.
　Among chicken eggs, those from silky fowl are considered the best, with these (from yellow hens) being second best. The taste is sweet and neutral, with slightly cooling properties. It effectively calms the five organs and treats hot flashes/fever. Good for epidemic diseases. People with weak spleen and stomach benefit from eating it. When boiled with vinegar and eaten, it cures dysentery.

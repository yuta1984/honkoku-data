The Bencao Gangmu Collection and Explanation states: Shizhen said that in the third month, it produces vines that extend and spread, with leaves floating on the water surface that are flat with pointed tips, and the shiny surface is like a mirror. The stem below the leaves has joints like shrimp legs. One stem and one leaf are arranged in pairs, alternating like butterfly wings. In the fifth and sixth months, it opens small white flowers that turn away from the sun, closing during the day and opening at night, moving with the moon. Its fruits come in several varieties: some are triangular or quadrangular, others have two angles, and some have no angles. Wild water caltrops grow naturally in lakes, with both leaves and fruits being small, and their angles are hard and upright, pricking people. Their color is green when tender and black when old. When tender, they are peeled and eaten for their sweet taste; when old, they are steamed and boiled before eating. Cultivated water caltrops are planted in ponds and reservoirs, with both leaves and fruits being large, and their angles are soft and brittle. There are also those with two angles curved like a bow shape. Their colors include green, red, and purple.

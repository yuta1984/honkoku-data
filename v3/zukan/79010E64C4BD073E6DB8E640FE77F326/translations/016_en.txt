Water Caltrop (Ryōhishi) "Bencao Gangmu, Water Caltrop Fruit, Explanation of Names"
It grows in ponds and marshes. Its leaves float on the water surface in pairs, alternating front and back, left and right, with serrated edges and glossy appearance. In early and late summer, it opens four-petaled white flowers between the leaves, turning away from the sun and following the moon. This is its nature. It bears fruit that is green when young, becoming black when ripe and extremely hard. There are two-angled, four-angled, and three-angled varieties, with sharp edges. The two-angled and four-angled ones are female, while the three-angled ones are male. Its roots are like eelgrass. There are also plants that follow the sun without being flowers. Listed on the left:

Sunflower (Himawari-sō) "Secret Transmission Flower Mirror": Seeds are sown in spring to produce seedlings. Its leaves are alternate and light green in color. The top of its stem invariably follows the sun when young. Large ones reach over one jō in height, and in autumn open large petals over one shaku

with yellow flowers and bear numerous seeds. They do not follow the sun but merely lean toward the yang (south).

Cotton Plant (Kusawata) "Bencao Gangmu, Cotton Collection and Explanation": There are two varieties, early and late. For sowing seeds, the early variety is planted on the 88th night, while the late variety is planted after cutting wheat. When young, around dawn, all its leaves lean eastward, receiving the first rays of the sun, and this leaning becomes increasingly pronounced. At midday, they all face upward toward heaven. When the sun moves west, they all lean westward, receiving the setting sun, and this leaning becomes increasingly pronounced. At dusk, they all bow downward, becoming even more pronounced at night. They wait for dawn and point eastward. This is their nature. In autumn, flowers with continuous three leaves and five yellow petals open in the morning and wither in the evening. There are white stamens in the center. After flowering, they form pods that split into three parts when ripe, containing white cotton inside. Also, wild watermelon sprouts "Jihuang Bencao" and white flower vegetables "Bencao Gangmu," etc., have leaves that follow the sun.

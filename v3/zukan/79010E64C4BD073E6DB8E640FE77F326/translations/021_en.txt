Spider fern (kumonosu-shida) 《Chinese name unknown》
Grows among rocks in deep mountain valleys. Its leaves do not wither even through winter, remaining pale green in color.
From spring to summer, it produces young leaves in the center. The leaf tips become long like threads,
some thin, others pointed. It produces golden spots (sori) on the undersides of leaves. These are
its flowers. Generally, most fern species produce flowers on the undersides of their leaves. In midsummer, the leaf tips produce
lump-like structures that, when they touch the ground, grow thin roots and thus propagate by division. Presumably
this occurs when the leaf veins respond to the earth's energy and generate growth. One or two
similar species are listed on the left.
Iron-foot phoenix-tail grass (nuritora-no-o) 《Jiuhuang Yepu》 Grows in deep mountains. Its leaf stems are thin, with small green leaves that do not wither through winter.

It produces golden spots on the undersides of leaves. These are its flowers. In summer, when the stem tips touch the ground,
they produce small seedlings and thus propagate by division.
Wisteria fern (fuji-shida) 《Chinese name unknown》 Grows in deep mountains. Its leaf stems are long, with small leaves that are densely packed and green, not withering
through winter. In midsummer, those leaf tips that touch the ground produce roots and propagate by division.
It is a type of iron-foot phoenix-tail grass.
Vine fern (tsuru-shida) 《Chinese name unknown》 Grows in deep mountains. Its leaves are pale green, with fine leaves growing densely on a single stem, or
sometimes sparsely, their form not uniform. They do not wither through winter, and in midsummer, the leaf tips
develop lumps that, when touching the ground, immediately take root.
Swamp horsetail (sawa-sugi) 《Chinese name unknown》 Grows beside ponds and marshes in mountainous areas and along marsh edges. Its form resembles that of club moss (hikage-no-kazura).

Aginashi (Chinese name unknown)
It grows from old tubers in spring in shallow water of ponds, marshes, and mountainous areas. Its leaves grow in pairs, alternately arranged front-back and left-right, resembling the leaves of water plantain (Alisma). By the end of summer, it branches like arrowhead (Sagittaria) leaves, becoming very narrow. Compared to arrowhead leaves, they are somewhat stronger with deeper color, and the stem has ridges with sparse flesh in the center. In autumn, it extends stems between the leaves at various times, dividing into three stems with three-petaled flowers that open early in the morning and wither in the afternoon. The flowers are white with yellow stamens. This continues all the way to the stem tips. After flowering, it produces blue-colored fruits. In winter the shoots wither and the roots form a single mass. In summer and autumn, only the white soft roots remain.

Around the old tuber, within the skin, numerous new tubers are produced. They vary in size and are black in color. The following year, in spring, the tuber skin naturally decays and new growth emerges. Large ones branch in their leaves, while small ones do not branch, and their form is entirely like newly sprouted water plantain. This is a variety of arrowhead. Arrowhead (according to Dongui Bogam) grows in ponds and marshes in spring. Its leaves grow in pairs, alternately arranged front-back and left-right, with ridged stems and sparse flesh in the center. In summer it opens white flowers between the leaves at various times. There are three-petaled, four-petaled, and double-petaled varieties. In midsummer, white soft roots spread and where their ends encounter sand and gravel, small tubers form in autumn. Their shape resembles small water chestnut roots. Water chestnut (according to Bencao Gangmu) also grows in ponds and marshes. Its nature is like arrowhead, and its form is plump

In autumn, it produces bracts, takes on purple color, extends purple stems, and opens eight or nine pale yellow flowers from bottom
to top. Three petals above, two petals, with purple spots on the tongue, and yellow round stamens in the center.
The fragrance is elegant and unique, beyond what other flowers can achieve. Also, the Zhang orchid has leaves of about one foot, pale
green in color, soft and dwarf, opening obliquely and drooping, with luster. It produces tender shoots in summer. Like the sword orchid,
in autumn it extends purple stems from beside the root bulbs, and preceding the sword orchid, opens eight or nine
flowers from bottom to top. Its fragrance surpasses that of the sword orchid. Considering the sword orchid and Zhang orchid as
male and female is incorrect. Also, the winter orchid has leaves of about one foot, pale green in color, broad, soft and dwarf,
not standing upright, with luster. Its roots are thinner than those of the sword orchid and Zhang orchid. In summer, beside the previous year's root bulbs,
it produces tender shoots. The bracts are somewhat long, strong and broad, their color pale green with luster.

From winter to spring, beside the previous year's root bulbs, inside the bracts and outside the leaves, it produces purple bracts,
extends purple stems, and opens four or five flowers from bottom to top. Three petals above, two petals with deep purple
vertical stripes, deep purple spots on the tongue, and yellow round stamens in the center. The fragrance is intense. Orchid
varieties are quite numerous. I separately compile one volume of "Orchid Varieties." I briefly list one or two varieties below.
Blue orchid 《Guangdong New Language》《My Thoughts》: Its leaves are about two feet, deep green in color, standing upright, compared to sword orchid leaves
they are somewhat narrow and thin, lean and weak. The growing season is the same as the sword orchid. Bracts are blue-green, roots like the sword orchid. In autumn, from beside the previous year's
root bulbs, it produces green bracts, extends blue-green stems and opens flowers.
Blue in color with fragrance like the sword orchid. It is of the finest quality.
Grass orchid 《Guangdong New Language》《My Thoughts》: Its leaves are deep green in color, narrow and thin, small and dwarf, about one foot drooping. The roots are like the winter orchid

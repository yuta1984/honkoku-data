Dianella [Yahitobana] - Compendium of Materia Medica
　It has mild toxicity. There are two types: upright-growing and vine-growing varieties. The upright-growing type is the root of Duchesnea (wild strawberry). The one described here is the vine-growing type. It is abundant in fields and bamboo groves. The leaves are opposite and hairy. In summer, it produces tubular flowers between the leaves and bears fruit. When it ripens in winter, it turns yellowish-brown. If mistakenly eaten, it causes nosebleeds.

Lycoris [Tengaibana] - Compendium of Materia Medica
　It has mild toxicity. It is abundant in mountains and fields. It produces leaves in winter, which wither and decay by summer, appearing as if there is no plant. In autumn, it sends up a single stem from one root, and six-petaled red flowers cluster at the top of the stem. When children pick and eat this, their speech becomes impaired. Therefore, it has the name "shita-magari" (tongue-bending). Also, Lycoris sanguinea (fox's razor) and Lycoris squamigera (summer daffodil) are species of the same genus.

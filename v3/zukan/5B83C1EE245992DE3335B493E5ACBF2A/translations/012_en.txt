Hanjō (Arisaema serratum) [Mamushi-sō]　Compendium of Materia Medica, Konjac Collection and Analysis
　　It contains great poison. It grows in shaded areas of deep mountains in spring. Its root is a round tuber, with a single stem emerging independently, having purple-black festering-like spots.
　　The leaves have two stems, one large and one small. Its shape is like Arisaema
　　and easily confused with it. If one mistakenly eats this, it is as fearsome as
　　Arisaema.

Mandara-ge (Datura) [Chōsen-asagao]　Compendium of Materia Medica
　　It is poisonous. Seeds are sown in spring. It resembles eggplant leaves and is pale green in color, with soft stems.
　　It blooms in autumn. Its shape resembles morning glory
　　but with a long tube, white color, and white stamens. When the flower falls,
　　it bears fruit with thorns. When one flower ends,
　　another flower blooms at the tip.
　　Each branch behaves in this
　　manner. If one mistakenly
　　eats this,
　　one immediately goes mad. It is fearsome.
　　However, if the poison is neutralized,
　　there is no harm.

From the section under Shashin (Adenophora) in Bencao Gangmu
Chen Cangqi states:
　Yangru root (Sheep's milk root)

　Fūrinkazura (Wind-bell vine)
　Tsurigane ninjin (Bell ginseng)
　Tsurigane kazura (Bell vine)
　Tsuru ninjin (Vine ginseng)

Upon examination, yangru (sheep's milk) is another name for shashin. However, what Chen calls yangru is Japanese shashin resembling yangjiaocai (sheep's horn vegetable) (because it has vines, it is also called man ninjin [vine ginseng] or gen ninjin [string ginseng]). Yangru root resembles a different species and is the vine-type shashin mentioned in the section under shashin in Honzō Wakai. This is also called man ninjin (vine ginseng), and this explanation is reasonable. The root of yangru also resembles shashin.

tora-u is wide. The space between two-three is six bu or five and a half bu cut. This is only
used as a clue to identify one or two grains.

Even though it is morning glory grass, one can grow cuttings,
graft vines, or use cut flowers to obtain seeds. Since I
enjoy this flower and have experimented with it, I record it below.

○ To graft vines, plant two plants side by side in the same pot and provide plenty of
fertilizer. Cut four bu from both stems, join them together, and wrap with flat
sedge grass. After about one month, remove the sedge and cut one side at an appropriate
location. The same principle applies for three or four plants.
Alternatively, when one true leaf emerges from between the cotyledons, take
half from one leaf, join both sides and plant them. They should
attach within one month.

○ For cuttings, sturdy vines should be five sun long, while for soft vines,
leave the tip intact. When buds begin to emerge from that point, cut two to three sun below
and insert diagonally into the pot. Especially for one week,
place in partial shade and avoid direct strong sunlight. Sandy soil is preferable.

　Ne　　　　Tora　　For sakura-zaki type, the space between ne-ushi is narrow
　　　Two　　Three
　Ushi　　　U　　Both tora and u are thin, and the space between two-three is
　seven bu, the space between one-two is three bu. Hige-zaki (bearded bloom) has a large perimeter
　and sometimes tora-u is narrower than ne-ushi. Two-three is narrow at
　three bu cut. Kujaku-zaki (peacock bloom) resembles the leaves of hige-zaki
　but the opening at three is flat. Tora-u opens more than ne-ushi.
　Chijimi (wrinkled) or rindo-zaki (gentian bloom) has tora-u narrower than ne-ushi. The space between two-three
　is five bu. For others based on ordinary leaves, from ne-ushi

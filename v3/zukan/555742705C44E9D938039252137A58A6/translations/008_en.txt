It is not that it cannot be done. So I said: There is a proverb that states "Those involved are confused, while observers see clearly." All things are like this - how could it be limited to only the game of Go?

The old man's appreciation of shells allows no room for competitive spirit or thoughts of fame and profit to enter his heart. His mind is clear and open, and he observes the shells with a completely disinterested spirit. This is exactly like a detached observer. With such an attitude in appreciation, he would not err even once in a hundred attempts. Is this not natural?

People in the world call such observers "eight eyes" (referring to the advantage of having multiple perspectives). Now, the character for "shell" (貝) is composed of the elements "eye" (目) and "eight" (八). Therefore, I propose to name this work "Mokuhachi-fu" (Eight-Eyes Manual). This signifies clarity of vision and insight.

The old man laughed and gratefully said: "You regard me as a detached observer - this is truly so! As for the implications of this, I find it too honorable for me to accept. However, receiving these words from you is like obtaining a precious shell for me - how delightful!"

Thus I write this as a preface.

Written in the early autumn of Kōka 2 (1845), year of the Wood Snake, by Tomiyana Jijū Sugawara Toshiyasu (Hakukō).

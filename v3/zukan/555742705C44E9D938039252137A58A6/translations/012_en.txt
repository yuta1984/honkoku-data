there are few refined people. Therefore, there are no connoisseurs who appreciate rare shells and curiosities. Consequently, many specimens lack even local dialect names. The *Bencao Gangmu* (Compendium of Materia Medica), Shellfish Section, Volume 46, lists over twenty species of mussels and clams.

○In Sekiju's opinion, the specimens recorded in the *Bencao* focus solely on therapeutic properties and flavors, while descriptions of form, surface patterns, and markings are extremely crude and incomplete.

○Although clams, snails, univalves, shells, and oysters are scattered throughout various texts, their true forms remain unclear and discrepancies are most numerous. Some texts merely list names while omitting descriptions of coloration and surface patterns. Therefore, attempts to match specimens to different sources often prove inaccurate.

○Moreover, when one occasionally obtains an unfamiliar shell, calling it a "mutation" or "transformation" often involves crude speculation, carelessly assigning names without describing form or coloration - such cases are frequently encountered. Additionally, citations in various texts fail to distinguish errors from original sources, perpetuating corruptions through successive copying. Readers should carefully consider these issues.

○In the *Bencao Gangmu*, under the section on mussels, [Li] Shizhen states: "Long ones are generally called 'bang' (mussels), round ones are generally called 'ge' (clams)." In Sekiju's opinion, why should mussels and clams be distinguished by length? Some are long vertically, others long horizontally. Distinguishing mussels from clams by length is inappropriate. Mussels and clams refer to bivalves, similar to how "luo" and "lei" both refer to snails. Shizhen's assertion that "long ones are called mussels, short ones are called clams" probably does not refer to bivalves in general, but rather distinguishes between long and short forms within the genus of freshwater mussels. Horse-tooth shells, black herons, and mandarin ducks are long in form; pine-needle shells and kingfisher shells are short in form. Perhaps he was explaining such categories, though this remains unclear. Or perhaps he called those with round wing-shells and long wing-shells like venus clams the shorter type, calling them "clams." When speaking of "short and round," moon-date shells and sea-mirror types should be called both short and round. This requires consideration.

○Regarding ancient theories about shells, they are detailed in a book called *Nagisa no Tama* (Jewels of the Shore) written by Kenkado Sekikyo, a resident of Yamashiro Province. This book was written with focus on the nomenclature and historical facts of shells. Therefore, I defer to that work regarding historical matters and omit them here.

○Although many poems are quoted in works such as the *Kanmon Kaifu* (Shell Observation Manual), *Kai-zukushi Ura no Nishiki* (Comprehensive Shells: Brocade of the Bay), and *Nagisa no Nishiki* (Brocade of the Shore), some poems do not accurately correspond to the specimens. Many are also attributed to "unknown poets." Poetry, linked verse, and haikai composed at will by later writers cannot serve as reliable evidence. Poems by renowned authors with correctly identified poets may serve as acceptable evidence.

○Generally, for bivalve shells, complete specimens are considered best. However, even rare shells that are single valves or fragments should be preserved for future comparison. Complete specimens should be obtained and treasured. The statement in *Kai-zukushi Ura no Nishiki* that "single valves are useless" is incorrect. This is like saying one loves the flowers of plants but discards the branches and roots - it can hardly be called true appreciation of shells.

○In various clams and mussels, shells from which the flesh has departed in the sea have small holes about one *bu* in size. These are said to be bored by marine worms. Another theory states that octopuses, attempting to eat the flesh, create small holes by suction regardless of shell thickness. Whether this is true or not is unknown. Shells with such defects are considered secondary. While snails and shells generally lack such small holes, snails rarely have single holes. They are not commonly seen in shells, and I have not yet observed such holes in large specimens.

○Generally, for bivalves, the cup-like valve is considered the body. The flat, flattened, and shallow side serves as the lid. For shells with valves of equal depth, place the slightly longer side to the right, with the upper shell serving as the lid. Round forms should be identified by their hinge. For toothed hinges, the concave side of the teeth forms the body, the convex side the lid. For shells with ears, place the ear on the longer side to the right, with the upper shell as the lid. For shells with ears of equal length, the valve with the hinge margin curved inward serves as the body. The same applies to shells with serrated hinges. Oysters invariably have a triangular prominence at the hinge - this is the body.

○Shells from which living flesh has been removed invariably display lustrous and beautiful surfaces. Shells that became empty in the sea lack luster. However, depending on their quality and place of origin, some naturally possess brilliance. Some shells have skin-like salt deposits attached to their surfaces. These should be scraped with a small knife and polished clean with a brush. Also, beans (continues...)

Yakuchishi (Alpinia seed)　　Cardamomium minus 《Dutch》

There is an illustration by the Dutch botanist Uheiman. This is a plant that neither Japanese nor Chinese scholars have been able to observe as living specimens. Its form resembles shukusha (cardamom), but the leaves are somewhat smaller, and the fruits are also smaller.

In my investigation, both shukusha and yakuchi are described as tall trees according to the illustrated explanations recorded by Uheiman. However, when I examine various later Western texts, they describe them as herbaceous plants, which accords with Chinese explanations. Nevertheless, since I cannot obtain accurate realistic illustrations, I include the ancient diagrams for now.

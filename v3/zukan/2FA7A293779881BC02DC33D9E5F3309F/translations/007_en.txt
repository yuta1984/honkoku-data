Alpinia (Renkyō)　Kansekiran

Commonly called Kinkeiran (Golden Cock Orchid). Rarely cultivated in private homes. Does not wither in winter. The leaves resemble Bletilla striata but are shorter, and also resemble iris seedlings but are broader, with pale yellow spots, hence also called "haraiwaران". A single stem grows from beside the roots, about one shaku (30cm) in height, with flowers standing at the tip having seven sepals. The shape resembles Bletilla striata but is yellow in color. The roots produce one bulb per year. The shape resembles a spiral shell and is green in color, with many growing in clusters. The taste of the roots is as pungent as chili peppers. According to Mr. Kanda's account of this plant, it grows wild in the mountains of Kii Province, where local people harvest the roots and add them fresh to vegetables to enhance flavor. It is pungent and aromatic, resembling chives.

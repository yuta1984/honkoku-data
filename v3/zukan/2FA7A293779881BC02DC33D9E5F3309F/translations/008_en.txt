Alpinia (Tojaku)　Blue Kumatakeran

In Nagasaki it is called Japanese Alpinia galanga. Its form resembles kumatakeran, about one shaku (30cm) in height, with green stems. In warm regions it does not wither in winter. The flower shape resembles Alpinia galanga, white in color with a pale red center. Both leaves and roots have a good fragrance. The roots are yellow and taste pungent. According to Hongjing's theory, "the leaves resemble ginger and have veins, resembling Alpinia galanga but finer, with a pungent and aromatic taste." Also, in the Guangdong Xinyu it states: "Used fresh as an herb, fruit vendors often use it as a spice. This is presumably the tojaku, not the grass fruit found among vegetables. Its seedlings resemble cardamom, flowering in the third month forming spikes. The color is white with slight redness. In the fifth and sixth months it bears fruit. Its roots are superior to the leaves, with a pungent and warming taste, effectively warding off miasma." This is it. Senior scholars' attribution to iris or evening primrose etc. are all errors. There is a separate detailed examination.

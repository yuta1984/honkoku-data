I select specimens and arrange them in flower beds to serve as comfort for my old age.
My devoted efforts have borne fruit, resulting in over one hundred excellent varieties.
However, whether the name is "hanakatsumi" or "hanashōbu,"
which is the true name? Originally, plants may have
two names for one species, or they may be different species by nature. Are hanakatsumi and hanashōbu
also one plant with two names? I have not yet fully understood the true nature of their names.
Nevertheless, in ancient poems we find "At Asaka marsh in Mutsu, the hanakatsumi - does love pass to those who gaze upon it?" (Kokin-shū, author unknown), or "In the May rains
at Asazawa marsh, the hanakatsumi - hiding away as I gaze upon it"
(Senzai-shū, Fujiwara no Nakaaki). Based on these poems, there must have been
famous places for hanakatsumi in Sumiyoshi County of Settsu Province, inspiring such verses.
Or "At Nozawa lagoon, the rain clearing slightly with heavy dew - iris flowers adorning the eaves" (Shūgyoku-shū, Great Monk Jien). When Middle Captain Sanekata
was in exile in Mutsu, he said "How could humble eaves have the same
iris as in the capital?" and used hanakatsumi to thatch
his eaves on the Boys' Festival (Kōeki Zokusetsu-ben, latter part, volume 43). Also, when Sanekata
was in Mutsu, since there were no iris in that place,
thinking water plants were the same thing, he used hanakatsumi for thatching
on the fifth day of the fifth month. The claim that this became a local custom of using hanakatsumi
for thatching is incorrect (ibid.). Pulling iris grass

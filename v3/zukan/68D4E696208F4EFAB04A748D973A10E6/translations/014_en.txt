The elegant forms achieved through technique are not drooping,
and it is wrong to consider them vulgar. Even large flowers, if they are silk-textured
flat blooms without technique, can hardly be called superior flowers. Ordinary
flowers reach full bloom the day after opening, displaying their technique,
and wither by the third day. This is because they are prone to disorder. Superb varieties
reach only half-bloom the day after opening, and after three days
gradually reach full bloom, displaying their technique, lasting four to five days before
withering. Moreover, what we call "technique" includes wild blooming, petal breaks, twists, and irregularities,
and though there are gradations of quality among these, it is difficult to judge all details correctly.
What I call superior flowers and cherish are those with crepe-like
texture, thick and round petals that are wide and layered,
fully vigorous large blooms that combine beautiful color—these I designate as such.
However, since there are originally no established
standards for determining the principles of flowers, and I have merely indulged in my preferences
in illustrating these forms, it is difficult to say which are right
and which are wrong. Though I now discuss their relative merits,
I do not presume to say this should serve as a model for existing flower enthusiasts,
but only that I have determined by personal opinion
what I consider superior and cherish them. Perhaps due to the depth of this affection,
during the cold dew and frost descent seasons, when the climate turns harsh and wild grass

opening and hibernating through winter, then waiting for
the new growth to emerge in the coming spring—the joy
is beyond words. The cultivation of these flowers
yields results like obtaining one hair from nine oxen, so
I have compiled rough writings into one small booklet, entitled
"Record of Japanese Iris Cultivation." Readers might
dismiss this as the folly of a dilettante, but if one is truly
a gentleman who loves flowers, he will know that my poor words are
                    not without merit.

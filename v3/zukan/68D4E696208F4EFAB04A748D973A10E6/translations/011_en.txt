"My hands grow weary - how did those long roots come to grow in Asaka marsh?"
(Kanji 7th year, Ikuhōmon-in Root Competition, Fujiwara no Yoshitaka). Therefore, it is not that there were no iris plants in that land. Considering why the explanations differ, perhaps because Sanekata's
residence was a place of exile, he used hanakatsumi out of
discretion when thatching. Perhaps calling hanashōbu "hanakatsumi"
is a regional dialect. That there exists a separate variety called hana-ayame
is clearly proven by Jien's poem. It is strange and
wondrous that only the hanashōbu called hanakatsumi in Mutsu, when grown from seed over many years,
produces variants from the original species. However,
when growing wild in those marshes, there are only slight differences in flower form,
and the colors never change. This is perhaps because they grow wild
while preserving their natural qualities completely. Even in my garden, when those seeds scatter
and grow naturally over many years, they produce only common flowers. Even in a small garden,
if they grow wild with sufficient climate and soil conditions, they do not lose their true nature. Since the seeds ripen from before the autumn equinox,
I collect them and store them in bags, keeping them indoors for seven or eight months
before sowing them before the spring equinox of the following year. Being separated from the natural
climate and soil conditions and losing natural nourishment, they perhaps bloom with countless
rare flowers. This might be called the mysterious workings of human artifice.
Furthermore, when I privately consider the origins of the hanashōbu commonly distributed today,

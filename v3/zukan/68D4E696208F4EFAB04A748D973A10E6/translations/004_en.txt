from common folk to women, all cherish
flowers. When my father was alive,
he loved all kinds of flowers and finally cultivated them,
never tiring of gazing upon them. However, being in government service

I predict their characteristics from the form of their sprouts,
and from late spring I can see their flowers as if
before my eyes. When summer comes, the blooming flowers
never fail to captivate me. Making me endure

the luxuriant leaves sway in the wind, naturally adding
the pleasure of cool evening breezes.

harbor the moon's reflection, and before long autumn passes
away, and in the light frost of early morning, in the appearance
of withered leaves I contemplate what remains, by the tightly shut window with a hearth

When planting, wash off all soil attached to the roots, dry briefly, then plant - this will cause immediate wilting. Although iris is an aquatic plant, and many people plant it in pots without drainage holes and grow it with standing water, when cultivating in pots the plants are weak and difficult to fertilize adequately, so the true flowers bloom poorly and the leaves are thin and weak, becoming incomplete by around the Frost Descent period (mid-ninth month). Potted plants with drainage absorb fertilizer quickly, so they grow strong with adequate nutrition, and by late autumn they become accustomed to daily morning frost and maintain their summer appearance, providing an attractive view even when not flowering. Now, when wanting to pot seedlings blooming for the first time,

evaluate the superiority of flower forms during blooming, dig up carefully to prevent root rot, transplant to the flower bed for cultivation, and plant using the aforementioned method when autumn equinox arrives. During spring equinox, dig out while still in pots and arrange in a sunny location. Remove fallen leaves. From when shoots emerge about three inches until flower stalks begin to appear among the leaf clusters, apply fish fertilizer three times, then twice more from after flowering until the end of summer's dog days - five times total. Also, when approaching summer heat, bury pots up to the rim in soil, otherwise the intense heat will overheat the pot interior and wither the new roots. For plants grown in flower beds, divide the roots into three or four clumps after flowering, with the front of the plants facing outward.

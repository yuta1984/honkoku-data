facing outward and combine them into one clump for planting. When planted
in flower beds, they will flourish and grow vigorously even if left alone, and while it is said
to be good to replant every year, even replanting every other year will not cause
them to wither.

Seed Cultivation
They ripen from before the autumn equinox. Collect only those that have
changed color before they split open, harvest and store them in bags indoors,
then sow them thinly in flower beds without fertilizer before the spring equinox.
If sown thickly like in seedbeds, they will become overcrowded and
after transplanting to the flower garden they will all wither and be difficult

to grow vigorously. Never neglect morning and evening watering. When they have grown
about three to four inches, nourish with fish fertilizer, then during the rainy season thin them out with seedlings spaced about eight to nine inches
apart and plant in flower beds, water every evening, and after fourteen to fifteen days
nourish with fish fertilizer, continuing to nourish at twenty-day intervals until Beginning of Winter (tenth month),
then the following spring from when shoots emerge about three to four inches until flower stalks
sprout among the leaf clusters, nourish twice. They will flourish
like parent plants and all will bloom. Well-fertilized plants will produce about three
flower stalks. Someone said that seedling plants do not
bloom the following summer, claiming this is not due to cultivation methods but
differences in climate and soil, but those who are inadequate

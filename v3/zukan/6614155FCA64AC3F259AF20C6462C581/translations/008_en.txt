General Principles
1. This book specializes in plants and trees with unusual properties, examining and correcting errors in their nomenclature. The book titles annotated below the Chinese names indicate the sources of those names. For Chinese names that are not yet clearly established, Japanese phonetic readings are used, and Japanese names are recorded alongside the Chinese names. However, since regional dialects are extremely numerous, only those familiar to the ear are recorded, and some folk explanations are included to highlight cases where the properties contradict each other. Nevertheless, there are so many that there is no time to enumerate them all exhaustively, and what my limited observation can reach is merely one out of a thousand.

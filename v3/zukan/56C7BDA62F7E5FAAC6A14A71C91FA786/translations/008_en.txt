One variety:
Ryūnō-kiku (Camphor Chrysanthemum)
This is a white chrysanthemum that grows wild in the mountains. It is found in the mountains of Mino, Ōmi, Ashio in Shimotsuke, Tamagawa in Bushu, and various other provinces. The variety from Kameyama in Tanba has large flowers. It grows to about two shaku in height. The leaves are small and the fragrance resembles camphor. This is the camphor chrysanthemum recorded in the Kangxi Chrysanthemum Catalog, also called kogin-dai (small silver platform). This belongs to the category of white chrysanthemums as explained by Su Song.

Autumn Chrysanthemum (chū-kiku)
There is a variety of this type called "asahi."
Its form resembles the sweet chrysanthemum and grows four to five shaku tall. There are also Chinese varieties. Japanese varieties are extremely numerous. Because the flower colors change when grown from seed, the number of variety names is incalculable. This is detailed in the Kiku-kyō (Chrysanthemum Classic). In China, variety names are listed in works such as Fan Chengda's Great Chrysanthemum Catalog, the Kangxi Chrysanthemum Catalog, Flower History Left Volume, Qunfang Catalog, and Secret Flower Mirror.

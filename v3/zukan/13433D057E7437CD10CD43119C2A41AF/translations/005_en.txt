Change follows the fashion of things. Previously, a thing called tachibana (citrus) became fashionable, and high and low alike competed to obtain it in the markets, overturning the corners of square gold coins and breaking the waists of koban coins. Indeed, fashion is the transformation of creation, and transformation is the rise and decline of things. Therefore, tachibana also eventually fell out of favor, to the point where even its own past became unworthy of nostalgia. Soon people devoted their enthusiasm to sekishōbu (stone sweet flag), and while omoto leaves spread throughout the world, even the elegant peak of sakura-sō (primrose) was not awaited before it ended. This time, morning glories achieved their moment of glory, and in Tsu Province Naniwa, wealthy families and prosperous people, regardless of noble or humble, monk or layperson, delighted in them and likened them to sumo wrestling, determining what was good or bad in Naniwa and competing over victory and defeat—this has been going on for about three years now.

Because of this, the varieties of morning glories increase monthly in number, and even if one were to count the stars in heaven, they could not be exhausted. Their prices rise daily, as if climbing a cloud ladder. Indeed, those who cultivate them in the Eastern Capital now have roughly seven hundred varieties. What I have observed, I have copied here in small part—over five hundred varieties, each differing in form and leaf, each differing in elegant color. Those that differ in appearance are made known through their form, and those that differ in color are expressed through the brush. I have titled this "Morning Glory Collection" (Asagaosō). Though my writing and painting are poor,

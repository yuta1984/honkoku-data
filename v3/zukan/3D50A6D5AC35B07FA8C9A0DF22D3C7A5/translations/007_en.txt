Jia Dan's Flower Manual says: Peonies are called "tree peonies" by the Chinese. Ou Gong's Peony Manual contains over ninety varieties. Also, Yi Zhou presented nineteen varieties as tribute. Nowadays there are even more varieties. Su Shi said: The method for viewing peonies should be in the morning. After noon, they open and spread. These flowers should be grafted by division in autumn, the ninth month. Transplanting should be done during blooming time. Shu Yuanyu wrote "Peony Rhapsody." Qiu Xuan wrote "Record of Peony Glory and Disgrace."

From "Kaigen Remnant Records": Peonies are supernatural flowers and trees. During Emperor Minghuang's time, tree peonies bloomed magnificently in front of Chenxiang Pavilion. One branch with two heads - deep blue-green in the morning, deep yellow in the evening, with powdery leaves. The fragrance and beauty differed between day and night. The emperor said, "These are supernatural flowers and trees," and bestowed them upon Yang Guozhong.

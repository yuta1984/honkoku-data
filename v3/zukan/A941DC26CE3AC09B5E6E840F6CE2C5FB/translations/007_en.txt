On the Bon festival day of the 7th month, Itsuyu year, observed and sketched at Asai waterside

The *Yamato Honzō* states:
　　　Omodaka (arrowhead)
　　　　　Hime-omodaka (small arrowhead)

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　*Bencao Gangmu* (Compendium of Materia Medica)
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Water lily　hitsujigusa
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Marginal note: korenge)

　　　I state:
　　　　　I have not yet seen the correct characters for omodaka. Common people all mistakenly write it as takusha (Alisma plantago-aquatica).
　　　　　This is incorrect. Takusha belongs to medicinal plants and produces shoots in spring. In shallow water, its leaves are
　　　　　like an ox's tongue. It opens white flowers when autumn arrives. The reason omodaka is confused with taku-
　　　　　sha is that the Japanese name of takusha is called omodaka, and this false identification has persisted for a long time.
　　　　　There is also jikosō (sashi-omodaka). Its leaves resemble takusha but the roots are not those of takusha.
　　　　　Also, aginashi and atori resemble omodaka. Their flowers are also like omodaka's,
　　　　　white flowers with three petals. Calling these "small omodaka" certainly makes sense.

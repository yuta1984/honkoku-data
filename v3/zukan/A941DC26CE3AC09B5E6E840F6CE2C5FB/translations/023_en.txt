"Tashikihen" (Compilation of Botanical Knowledge) states in the mountain herbs section:
Sanshichi (Panax notoginseng)《Japanese name》Mitsuyotsu-hakusa (three-four-seven grass) or also called Yama-urushi (mountain lacquer)《Alternative name》Mountain lacquer《from Compendium of Materia Medica》
Jin-bu-huan (Worth more than gold)
《Kinbukan》

Shizhen says that the local people claim that this plant's leaves are three on the left and
four on the right, hence the name "sanshichi" (three-seven), but this is incorrect. Some say
it was originally named "mountain lacquer."

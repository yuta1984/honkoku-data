According to the "Honzo Wamyo" (Japanese Names for Medicinal Herbs):
Tiger cane [alternative names] bitter cane, great insect cane, spotted cane, sour cane [Japanese name] itadzuri

The "Kyuko Yafu" (Famine Relief Field Guide) states:
Vinegar-tube grass (itadori) grows by the waters of lakes and rivers. Its leaves resemble those of cotton rose hibiscus but it is a different plant.

The "Kyuko Honzo" (Famine Relief Materia Medica) states:
Sour-tube shoots (itadori)

In the "Bencao Gangmu" it says that tiger cane flowers in the seventh month and I hear that the flower shape resembles peach blossoms, but this entry says the flowers resemble chrysanthemums, which is questionable.
The "Shu Bencao" says the tree height is over one zhang, but Kou Zongshi doubts this and considers it incorrect. I think this is because what grows differs according to the locality. Is it only tiger cane that varies thus?

Written on the first day of the eighth month of the year Kinoto-Tori

The "Wamyo Ruiju-sho" states: The "Bencao" says
Tiger cane, also called martial cane [Japanese name] itadori

The "Imyo Bunrui-sho" (Classification of Alternative Names) states:
Two-leaf red leaf [tachihi]

The "Hansei-ki" (Record of Emperor Hansei) states: There was a well called the Auspicious Well. When they drew from it to bathe the prince, tachihi flowers had fallen into the well, so the prince was named Tachibana (many-delayed flower). This is what we now call tiger cane, etc.

In the "Yamato Honzo," Shizhen says that "cane" refers to the stem, and "tiger" refers to the spots.
In Sei Shonagon's "Makura no Soshi" (Pillow Book), she writes "itadori is written as 'tiger's cane.' It could do without the cane part - how presumptuous of it!" This is playful talk.
Old tiger cane should be used as a walking stick. It is very light, but it breaks easily.

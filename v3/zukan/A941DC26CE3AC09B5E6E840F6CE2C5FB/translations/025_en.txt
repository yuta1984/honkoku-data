"Kyūkō Honzō" (Famine Relief Materia Medica) states:
Hagi (Lespedeza) 《Also commonly called Zuigunchaと》《Both alternative and other names are detailed in Volume 1 of the Autumn Section》

One of the seven autumn grasses
Hinoe-Inu year, Nanryo (8th month), 17th day, re-copied

In "Yamato Honzō" it is recorded in the flowering plants section

"Jukō" states:
There are three types of Lespedeza. Hagi refers to tree hagi. It is also recorded as withered hagi in "Taigen-shō". This tree does not die in winter, and produces branches and leaves from the tree in spring. This is the Chinese hagi (tō-hagi) that came from China. Also, what grows from perennial roots in spring and withers in winter is grass hagi. There is also one type with thread-like tassels hanging down and deep flower color. These two types grow in mountains everywhere and are native species of our country. The wild hagi of Miyagino and others are separate varieties.

"Wakan Sansai Zue" in the wetland plants section states:
Ketsumeishi (Cassia seed) Batei-ketsumei
《ketsumeishi》《Japanese name》Ehisukusa
Commonly called Batereigusa
Perhaps a corruption of "horse hoof grass"

"Tashiki-hen" in the fragrant grass section states:
Ketsumei
Japanese names: Itachi
　　　　　　　 Sasage

Recorded in "Yamato Honzō" miscellaneous grass section

○Ketsumeishi 《namely this horse hoof ketsumei》
Grass ketsumei 《namely blue box seed》
Stone ketsumei 《namely horse clam shell》

My opinion:
"Honzō Kōmoku" mentions two types: horse hoof ketsumei and jōbō ketsumei. The explanation of horse hoof matches well, and Japanese and Chinese sources agree. ○Jōbō ketsumei resembles horse hoof and also resembles locust tree leaves. At night they also do not close, flowers are similar and form horn-like pods about the size of a little finger. Bōkōnan is this ketsumei. However, "Sansai Zue" records both types as ketsumei and treating them as one thing in separate entries is an error. If not, then Bōkōnan is a separate species. Will copy in a later section.

The leaves are like this, these flower buds do not open, at their peak.

Bōkōnan (Itachi-sasage) Its flowers are called chakaji, or called kaidou, or directly called ketsumei

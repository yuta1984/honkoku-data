Three-legged Toad (Sansoku-senjō)
　According to Lu Youren's "Yanbei Zazhi" from the Song dynasty, Chen Shengguan heard Song Zhao's explanation about what Han Yu called "chánchú" (toad).
　This creature has three legs and differs from frogs. After Song Zhao left, he obtained a dried specimen from under the eaves of a medicine shop and showed it to Shengguan.
　It was a single body shell stuffed with wood shavings. Upon examination, it had three legs that were particularly long like a tail and had spurs. The forms commonly cast as inkstone water droppers may not be entirely accurate representations.

What is illustrated on the right was found in Tadokoro Village, Tsuga District, Shimotsuke Province during the Hōreki era. It was preserved by immersing it in medicinal liquid in a glass bottle, and this specimen was obtained by Tamura Motoo.
Although sixty to seventy years have passed since then, it has not deteriorated and remains as it was when first immersed.
It is still treasured in that household to this day. This should be called a marvel.

According to Western books, it is called "wast" in Dutch and "cera" in Latin. "Cera alba" refers to what is taken from nests made by new, young bees. "Alba" means white color. In Dutch, "cera virginea" means virgin wax. This is something produced without human intervention, meaning untouched by hand. Also, many artificially bleach yellow wax to make it white. In Latin, "cera flava" refers to what is extracted from old honeycomb. "Flava" means yellow. For its main therapeutic uses: if one wishes to disperse swelling and pain in affected areas, yellow wax should be used. If one wishes cooling effects, white wax should be used. Yellow wax is used in various hard plaster preparations, while white wax is used in fragrant ointments (scented oils). It is also used in sealing wax with five colors added, and for making substances to seal glass bottle mouths, called stopper wax.

The "Zhengzitong" annotates the character 𧒒: "𧒒 comb resembles the spleen, hence called honey spleen. When people harvest honey in winter cold, the bottom of the honey spleen becomes wax. Wax produces honey; honey is sweet and wax is mild, for nothing possesses both qualities beautifully."

Beeswax is yellow wax. Alternative names include yellow wax and yellow zhan. According to "Wanshi Jiachao": "Tang people called it yellow wax or yellow zhan. Both are made by boiling and refining honey dregs. This varies according to local dialects and colloquialisms." Also according to "Chengzhai Yichao Cuoyao": "Beeswax has the alternative name zhu." The meaning of the characters zhan and zhu above remains unclear, and I have long been puzzled by this. Years ago, Liu Guishan said: "White zhan frequently appears in medical formularies, in the Shengji Yugao formula in volume one of 'Waike Zhengzong.'

In the formula, there is white zhan. According to 'Wanshi Jiachao,' which records this formula, white zhan is written as white wax. From this we know that white zhan is an alternative name for white wax. Yellow zhan and white zhan also appear in Ming and Qing medical texts and 'Leishu Zuanyao,' but the meaning of zhan remains unclear." When I happened to examine "Chengzhai Yichao," all instances of the wax character were written as zhu. Upon consulting character dictionaries, zhu has no meaning related to wax. I suspect zhu was originally a vulgar character, and that the insect radical white wax was mistakenly written as zhu-ao, eventually becoming corrupted through transmission. But this too cannot be known for certain.

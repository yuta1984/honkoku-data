Stone Insect: According to Shosō's investigation, in the "Bencao Gangmu" under the entry for stone insects, Zangqi states: "Stone boring insects, also called Shixiaxin. Now found under stones at the bottom of water between Yi and Luo rivers. Their shape is like silkworms," etc. The "Shantang Sikao" calls them Shixiaxinfu. Hongjing states, etc., "Their form is like old silkworms, and the Qiang people obtain and eat them." Su Gong states: "Stone silkworms resemble silkworms in form, have horns and segments, and are blue-black in color." Baosheng states: "These insects are found among wood and stone, taken as fishing bait. They are most abundant at Mahu Shimen, where the local people eat them." Among these various accounts, those described as resembling old silkworms that people gather and eat must be these Suntaro-mushi. These creatures are found under large stones when lifted in mountain streams. This corresponds well with the statement "found under stones at water bottoms." Therefore, it should be appropriate to classify them as stone silkworms. One variety that binds sand and stones to make nests and hides its body within is called Daikoku-mushi. There are also things called Semushi and such. These attach to stone surfaces. While used as fishing bait, they are not things people should gather and eat. All these are different species of stone silkworms, completely different from what is illustrated here. What is illustrated here, when accidentally stepped on by people in rivers, immediately bites and injures. The pain is unbearable, the same as centipede wounds. Therefore, people fear being stung by these. Hence they are also called river centipedes.

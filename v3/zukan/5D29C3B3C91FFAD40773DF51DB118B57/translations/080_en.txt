　According to "Shōshū Fushi": "Kōjō has a green shell and white tail, and because its shape
 　resembles a ship's oar (jō), it received this name." "Sengun Shi" states that "because its shape resembles a fingernail,
　it was named Shikakarasu (fingernail shell)."
　According to "Sennan Zasshi": "In the north, mud bricks are called dohai, and in Shinjiang there is
　a shellfish also called dohai, with a green shell and white tail, having hair on its sides."
　"Taiwan Fushi" records it as "Kaitōga, also called tohai (dohai)."
　When people eat too many of these, red spots resembling the shape of this shellfish appear.

　decocting and administering safflower alone will provide instant relief, it is said. In Iwami Province,
　Hamada dialect calls it Kagerōgai.

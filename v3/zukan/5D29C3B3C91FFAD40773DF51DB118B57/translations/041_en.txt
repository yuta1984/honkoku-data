Umitake is sea bamboo shoot. Its flesh extends outside the shell from four or five sun to seven or eight sun. The tip is pointed, the flesh is white and hollow, resembling bamboo shoots,
hence this name. Its nature is sweet and mild, non-toxic, benefiting qi and strengthening yang. This creature is completely absent in other provinces and Kantō. Not limited to Chikugo,
it is occasionally found in the western seas. Many people in Kantō think it is not seafood. Many do not know
that it is the flesh of the bottom shell. Therefore, I illustrate this shell in sequence here to show to enthusiasts only.

The "Taiwan Prefecture Gazetteer" mentions white razor clams, saying: "Taiwan originally had no razor clams, but in the 59th year of Kangxi, they first appeared in the muddy flats of sea harbors. Their form is no different from razor clams of the mainland,
but the shell is thin and white like jade, and the flesh is particularly clear and sweet.
They appear in the fourth and fifth months."
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　The shell of this creature is extremely thin, and after soaking in water for a long time
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　and then washing it clean, it becomes very white like jade. What the Taiwan
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Prefecture Gazetteer calls white razor clams is precisely this.

Under the character 蟶 in "Zhengzi Tong" it says: "Pronounced chēng,
small clams that grow in muddy seas, two to three sun long, finger-sized,
resembling freshwater clams. People of Fujian and Guangdong cultivate them in fields called razor clam fields, and call their flesh razor clam intestines."
Now in Chikugo, being muddy sea without sand and stones, they create
boundaries like fields and cultivate this creature, it is said.
In China too, razor clam intestines are precisely sea bamboo shoots.
What "Zhengzi Tong" describes seems to explain the form of razor clams and ark shells, but considering that it speaks of cultivating them in fields and harvesting their
intestines, it should be this creature and no other.

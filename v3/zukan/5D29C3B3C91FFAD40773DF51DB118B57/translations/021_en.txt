It is reddish-brown in color. It is called yō (pupa), commonly called hiru. In Shikoku it is called mutsugu. It has legs and facial features. What remains in the pot when drawing silk is skewered on thin bamboo sticks, roasted until fragrant, and fed to children to treat the five intestinal worms. Like eating bee larvae, it has aroma and sweet taste. It is also called sanagi (pupa).

Byakukyōsan (White Stiff Silkworm)
Those used medicinally and of superior quality are straight and strong, extremely hard, and when broken, the interior is transparent like amber. The folk custom of the Sendai region calls this "oshyariko." Its surface appears as if dusted with white powder. Therefore it is called byakukyōsan (white stiff silkworm).

[Left folio]
To obtain seeds, cocoons that have not been sun-dried are placed in containers with goosefoot leaves covering them, and soon the pupae metamorphose and emerge. However, they break and pierce through one end of the cocoon. This is called the silkworm moth, which is the male butterfly. The Wamyōshō calls it "hihiru," and what is now called "hiiru" in Tosa Province is an ancient Japanese reading. In Awa Province it's called "hiuri," in the eastern provinces "hiru." Called chō (butterfly), it resembles a lamp moth with pale brown coloring. Males have thin, small bodies and fly about on paper. Females have large, fat bodies and lie motionless on paper, only moving their wings. When a male approaches a female, they immediately join tails and mate. When those just emerging from cocoons encounter females, they couple immediately. Therefore, in our country's wedding ceremonies, there are oral traditions regarding noshi wrapping and origami folding. After separating in about half an hour, they discharge red fluid. When placed on seed paper, they lay eggs on the paper one grain at a time in rows, never overlapping. As stated in the Tiangong Kaiwu: "One moth produces approximately over 200 eggs, naturally adhering to paper, each grain evenly distributed, naturally without any accumulation." This can truly be said to fully capture their form. This paper is called sanren, commonly called tanegami (seed paper), and also has names like sanshushi (silkworm seed paper), sanpushi (silkworm cloth paper), sanzeishi (silkworm molt paper), sankoshi (silkworm old paper), sanshutushi (silkworm emergence paper), shussanshi (emerging silkworm paper), santaishi (silkworm retreat paper), etc. ○ Byakukyōsan is called "oshari" in Ōmi Province and "hoshiko" in Edo. Alternative names include chokukyōsan (straight stiff silkworm), shibyō (dead ice), hakukansui (white euphorbia), etc. It is commonly written as kyōsan (strong silkworm) in popular usage. These are dead silkworms that have become white and straight, hard as stone. It is a daily medicine for pediatrics. Its efficacy exceeds that of cicada molts. Combined with gastrodia, it is an indispensable sedative for treating convulsions. Black-colored specimens of this substance are counterfeit. True byakukyōsan is difficult to obtain in large quantities. Years when this substance is available are said to be years when silkworms are blessed, and thus considered divine...

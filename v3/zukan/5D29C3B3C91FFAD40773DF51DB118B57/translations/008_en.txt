[Right folio]
The explanations of strange insects in the Compendium of Materia Medica (Bencao Gangmu) and such matters have not been thoroughly elucidated by people of old until now, but since this is the first time they have been explained in such detail, it is truly a most welcome development for those in this area who are fond of insects. Now, when asked to add a word, I, Hiroken, have been collecting materials both ancient and modern, and since my learning from these teachings is not shallow, I wish to repay the kindness received over the years. Previously, I first wrote and submitted studies on crickets and bell crickets. This year again, I add such humble writings to the edge of this volume. Written on the fifth day of early fourth month of Bunsei 2nd year, by the 62-year-old elder, Minamoto Hiroken.

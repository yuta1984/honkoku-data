What is illustrated on the right is a creature that lives in the waters of the Nile River in Egypt. That country lies to the west of southern India, is constantly covered by clouds, and is a tropical country where rain falls rarely.
In that country there is one great river called the Nile, also known as the Coiro River. This is indeed the great river of the African continent, and it is said that when it reaches downstream, it divides into more than seventy tributaries and flows down. No one has traced its source to the end, and it is said that the width of the river is unknown for how many ri it extends. The people of this country draw this river water for their livelihood. Every year in May there are floods, and the local people are said to predict the abundance or scarcity of the year by observing how much the water rises. Many of these creatures live in this river water. The local people catch and eat them, saying they greatly nourish people. What was brought by Dutch ships during the Hōreki era (1751-1764) was presented by Namura Santayū, an interpreter official in Nagasaki, to Tamura Ransui. Its entire body is covered with fine scales, resembling a Japanese whiting (kisago). However, it differs only in having short four legs. Its scales are extremely dense and lustrous, and when stroked by hand they are very smooth and difficult to grasp. Its body is round with the waist area slightly flattened. The head is pointed and the eyes are small. Upon careful examination, it appears to be a variant of aquatic lizard.

This is what happens when a toad enters water and transforms into a fish, commonly called "frog-transformed fish," which occurs rarely. Occasionally fishermen obtain these and raise them, feeding them small fish, loaches, earthworms, etc., and they are said to survive when kept for several months.
This is a product of Karatsu in Hizen Province, and no one knows its name. When this fish is in water, when there is much water it spreads its four fins and floats and swims, and when it reaches places with little water, it uses them as four legs and walks like a toad.
When kept in captivity, it constantly eats small fish.

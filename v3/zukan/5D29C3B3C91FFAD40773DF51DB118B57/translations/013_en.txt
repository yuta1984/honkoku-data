They all gather toward the left side. As the comb on the right side becomes clearly visible, it requires no effort to cut and harvest. When trying to cut the left side as well, one does the same as before. Although we had prepared ourselves expecting the swarm to become angry and chase or sting people, they were unexpectedly gentle and completely different from ordinary bee species. The person doing the cutting wraps cloth around his waist and works bare-chested, yet suffers no harm from poisonous stings. That person says, "When bees get trapped in clothing and suffer from being pressed, they will eventually sting. When they sting a person, the bee dies immediately on the spot. Therefore, they do not like to sting people." There is nothing to fear. Even if stung, there is no swelling or pain like with other bees. The venom is not severe. If one is stung, fresh honey should be applied immediately. The pain will stop instantly, the swelling will subside, and one will be at ease.

Generally, the medicinal pills commonly used in the world are all made by kneading this bee honey and removing the dregs. The people of the realm can rely on this substance to use incomparable good medicine. The number of people in the world who benefit from this substance cannot be counted. However, there is no one who studies what honey actually is. They only know that it has a sweet taste. Therefore, I illustrate this substance first in opening this volume and describe its virtues,

Generally, when trying to knead medicinal powder with honey, it is difficult to use as is. There is a method for refining it. Measure the quantity and put the honey in ceramic ware, boil hot water in a pot, and simmer it in a double boiler. When it is about to boil, thick foam rises to the surface - soak paper in it and scoop it away with a bamboo spatula. Drop that honey into cold water to form beads that do not scatter - this is the standard. With this, knead pills and store them in jars. Refining 160 monme and removing the foam should yield 120 monme. Done this way, it will not spoil even after years.

In Edo, official households sometimes set up bee houses in their gardens and harvest honey for entertainment. Inside the hall, departments are arranged, and in the inner sanctum above is the seat of the bee king. The retainer bees are seated in order as if they naturally hold official positions. Below is an assembly place for gathering flowers where large combs are constructed - this is where the honey is located. At the bottom of the hall, small openings are arranged in a row, comparable to five gates. Outside those openings, five soldier bees sit in formation guarding each gate, monitoring the flower tributes of incoming bees. The swarm goes out from the hall in early morning and returns at noon carrying flower stamens and nectar. When they enter the government gates, the guard bees inspect them before allowing entry. If any come trying to enter without carrying flowers, they are sternly turned away and not allowed in. If there are any who fight and resist,

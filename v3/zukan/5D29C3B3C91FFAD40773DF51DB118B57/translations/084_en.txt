Waraji-mushi (Straw Sandal Insect) - Funamushi (Sea Slater)
Lives among stone walls at the water's edge. When people see it, it runs quickly and hides in rock crevices. It is difficult to catch. It has fourteen legs on each side. Viewed from the belly, it appears to be all legs with no flesh. It is no different from the sow bug (pill bug). It has long whiskers that it frequently waves. It is said to transform into red dragonflies, but the details are unclear. According to my examination, the Zhenjiang Prefecture Gazetteer states "sow bug, also called rushoe insect." This is also a member of the sow bug family.

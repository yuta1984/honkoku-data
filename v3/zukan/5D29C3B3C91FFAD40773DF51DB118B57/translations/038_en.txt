Sea nettle - namely jellyfish, Japanese name is kurage. In Shushi Zakki it states "when alive it is called water mother, when dried it becomes sea nettle," and in Guangdong Xinyu it says "the dried ones are called sea nettle. Those dried in the eighth month have thick and crisp flesh, named 'eighth month offspring' and are most delicious."
In our country, they are abundantly produced in the seas of Bizen and Chikugo, where kurage and sea mushrooms are local specialties. These two provinces have muddy seas different from other provinces, and there are none at all in the Eastern Sea or Edo. The shape resembles an inverted lotus leaf, like congealed water scum. They float on the sea surface following waves and chasing tides. They have no eyes, mouth, hands, or feet, only something under the belly that trails long like tangled cotton. Many shrimp follow this. They move by means of these shrimp. Since jellyfish cannot move by themselves, it is said "jellyfish use shrimp as eyes." In Zhengzitong it states: "When the tide comes, swarming shrimp push the jellyfish like a bamboo raft. When the tide recedes, the shrimp abandon the jellyfish. Unable to depart by itself, it is stripped and eaten by people. When the tide comes, it follows and departs, then revives again" - this can be said to exhaust the description of its form.
In Guangdong Xinyu it says "under the belly are tangled legs called jellyfish flowers. The taste is bland, slightly fishy but delicious." Hizen and Higo provinces also produce these, but they are second to those from Bizen and Chikugo. What is commonly called "Chinese kurage" refers to those whose blood has been washed away using lime and alum water to whiten the color. If the lime toxin is not removed, it is said to harm people. There are imported Chinese kurage, which are the sea nettles of Guangdong Xinyu. They are yellow-white in color, thin like reeds, and round in shape. They are cut finely and eaten with ginger vinegar. The taste is bland and makes a sound when chewed, like wood ear mushrooms. They have alternative names such as Tangshan, Zhayu, and Chupu fish.
In Bencao they are already included among fish species, but I believe this is an error. These are of the worm class, not fish. Now

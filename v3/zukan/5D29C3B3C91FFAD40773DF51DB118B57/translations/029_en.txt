Hyōji (Ladybug)　This name appears in the "Teikyo Keibbutsu Ryaku" (Survey of the Capital's Natural Features). It is an insect of the purple eggplant.
In the sixth and seventh months, it naturally appears on eggplant leaves. At first it resembles a pill bug, and when it attaches to the underside of leaves, they all turn yellow and wither. When many attach, they absorb the vital essence and prevent flowering and fruiting. Its form becomes round and motionless, finally transforming into a ladybug and flying away. Its color is reddish-black with black spots.

Liu Dong of Macheng wrote in his "Teikyo Keibbutsu Ryaku":
"An insect that resembles a red bean with sesame-like spots
is called hyōji. It appears in vegetable beds, and when caught, it releases a foul-smelling
yellow stain that cannot be removed, yet children
persist in handling it with their hands."

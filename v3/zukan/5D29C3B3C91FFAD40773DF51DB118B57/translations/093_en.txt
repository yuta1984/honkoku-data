Golden beetle (Koganemushi)　Also called golden flower insect　《Tsukushi dialect: golden insect (Kinchū) | Jōshū Yoshida dialect: war helmet (jingasa) insect》　Ōshū Wakuya dialect: pillow arm (tamakura) insect

Shōzō respectfully notes that in the appendix to the locust section of the Bencao Gangmu, quoting from the Beihulu: "The golden beetle is a beetle. It emerges in Lingnan and lives on grass vines in the 5th and 6th months. It is as large as an elm pod, its back is like applied gold, it moves in pairs, and when it dies the golden color immediately fades. Therefore it is raised with powder to give people charm." Also quoting from the Luofushan Shu: "On the mountain there are golden flower insects, as large as blister beetles, with patterns like gold and shape resembling a turtle. They can be kept and admired for several days."

Looking again at volume 17 of the Qianque Leishu, quoting from the Lingbiao Lu Yi: "The golden beetle is a beetle. During spring and summer it lives on plants and trees. About the size of a fingernail, when flying it cannot be distinguished, but when it alights on grass vines and is observed closely, it is truly a golden-colored turtle child. It always moves in pairs. Southern people collect them, dry them in shade, and combine them with gold and jade as material for women's hair ornaments."

The Yuxi Ouji states: "In the 7th and 8th months there are golden turtle insects, as large as soybeans. The head, shell, feet, and tail are exactly like a turtle. The color is like red gold, they mostly live on hyacinth bean leaves, and can also fly. When dried they can be used for women's hair ornaments."

The Yibu Fangwu Ji states: "Golden insects emerge in the mountains of Lizhou, with bee-like bodies of green color with golden luster. The local people take them to use as decoration for women's hairpins and bracelets." The golden insect mentioned above refers to what we now call the jewel beetle (tamamushi).

In the Song dynasty Xue Shilong's preface to the Golden Turtle Rhapsody: "The golden turtle resembles a melon pest and is like a turtle but small, with head, feet, shell, and tail all complete, colored like yellow gold. However, what covers its exterior is light and bright like mica, with wings attached to the shell, a large neck and double whiskers, many legs under the belly, no different from a turtle."

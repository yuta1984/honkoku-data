䗪 insect (Ground beetle)　In the "Bencao Gangmu," Su Gong says: "This insect likes to live in the soil of rat burrows and under house walls. It resembles the rat woman (pill bug) but is larger,
over one sun in size, shaped like a turtle but without a shell, having scales instead. Children often catch them to make them carry things as play." Hongjing says: "The shape is flat like a turtle, with a shell but cannot fly. It has a slight odor."

This insect lives in the soil where elephants are kept. It is a type of cockroach. In Japan too, those produced in Dewa Shōnai
are the same as imported ones, large in form and beautiful. Their efficacy is also no different. They are also said to be produced in Satsuma. In China it has the name "earth turtle." The "Bencao Huiyan" says: "When this insect is cut with a knife,
there is white juice like syrup inside. When joined together, after half a day it reconnects and continues, and can walk around. Therefore, people nowadays use this to treat injuries from falls and blows, and it has miraculous effects in reconnecting sinews and bones" - this refers to this creature.

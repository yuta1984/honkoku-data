Kakurezato (Hidden Insect)　Also called Kotokoto-mushi or Chatate-mushi. Smaller than a sesame seed. Found on the paper of old shoji screens, it makes sounds by tapping with the round jaw around its mouth. When numerous, they sound like rain. They actively make sounds during the hot, humid rainy season from summer to autumn. They do not occur in well-ventilated places.

According to Li Shi's "Xu Bowu Zhi" from China: "In human dwellings there are small insects, extremely tiny but with great resonance. When seeking them, they suddenly cannot be seen. They are called 'qie chong' (thief insects). They are as large as half a sesame seed, shaped like pill bugs, with two white antennae. When they shake their heads, they make sounds. Meng Kang composed a rhyme-prose in the morning comparing them to demon leaders." Also, according to Xie Zhaozhe's "Wu Za Zu" from the Ming dynasty in Chenliu: "In the government offices of Zhejiang province there are always small insects. They resemble scarab beetle larvae but are small, like the tail of a needle, and like to crawl between paper windows. They can tap paper with their feet to make sounds, and when listened to quietly, they sound like dripping water. When pursued, they immediately jump." Could this also be a type of jiaoming (minute insect)?

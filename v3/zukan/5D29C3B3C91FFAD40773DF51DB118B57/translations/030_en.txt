Kan'ei 12, year of the Metal Monkey
Two days before the mid-autumn full moon,
I was at the guard quarters and personally
observed insects feeding on pine needles,
immediately drawing them
to show my colleagues.
Elder Tsū Aizan said:
"In the autumn month of Bunsei 4, year of the Metal Snake,
on the upper floor of my house
I had placed a potted pine (commonly called
hime komatsu five-needle pine).
One day, around the pot there were
grains of sand about the size of sesame seeds, blue-black in color, shaped exactly like horse-hoof senna seeds but smaller. Not knowing
what kind of seeds they were, I scattered them on a mat and ordered a servant girl to search for them. I found small green insects attached to the pine needles and quickly
removed them—twenty-three in total. This was two days before the mid-autumn full moon. It was the same time as when I had collected and drawn them in previous years,
which can be called quite remarkable."

Kōshi Toju (Akebia Moth Larva)
Insect of the Akebia
Copied this on the 26th day of the 6th month of Kinoe-ne year.
It is a caterpillar.
It has a forked tail,
and with that fork it clings
to tree leaves so firmly
that it will not let go. Its form also
resembles a geometrid moth larva (inchworm).

In Kii Province dialect it is called "Hatteugusu," and coastal people boil and eat its flesh. In the Nittō Gyofu, Baiyō's dictionary states that "the gyo resembles shrimp but has no feet, is one sun long, about the size of a thigh, and comes from Liaodong." Using this to identify this creature is inappropriate. It grows attached to rocks, hence it is called Ishibushi (stone joint). The joints have horizontal stripes and resemble kōchū insects. When boiled, the shell falls apart.

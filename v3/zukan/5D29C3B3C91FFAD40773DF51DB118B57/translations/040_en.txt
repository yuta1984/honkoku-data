Mud Bamboo Shoot　According to the "Bamin Tongzhi" (Gazetteer of Fujian), its shape is like a bamboo shoot but small, living in mud and sand.
It is found in the muddy sea of Yanagawa Kurume in Chikugo, about five or six sun deep in the mud. It belongs to shellfish,
with a shell like a razor clam but broader and larger, thin and brittle, easily broken. In local dialect it is called teikai (bottom shell). Its flesh extends above the mud
five or six sun, with large ones reaching nearly one shaku. When eaten raw, the taste is extremely delicious. Local people preserve it in salt and send it to distant places as
a delicacy. It is named kaijō, which means sea mushroom. I happened to obtain
one dried with shell in vinegar, and considering it rare and curious, I have drawn it from life to show to like-minded gentlemen.
　Its shape is like mirukui, with the front and back of the shell not fitting tightly together.
　On one side there is a thin lid, forming a double layer, which is curious. One side
　has a large opening as it is the mouth for the flesh to extend and retract. When I examine the "Bamin Tongzhi" again,
　the description "luo resembles razor clams but is broader, also among the finest of sea delicacies" likely
　refers to this creature.

It is called teikai (bottom shell) because it is buried deep in sea mud, hence this name. The shell is thin and brittle, easily shattered, with
windows front and back that fit snugly together.

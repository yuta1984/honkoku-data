Wood Leech (Kihiru) - Also called Wood Hiru or Mountain Hiru. Abundant in the mountains of Kiso in Shinshū Province, Mount Amagi in Izu, and other places. Upon hearing the footsteps of travelers, they fall like rain from the tops of tall trees. They enter into people's collars and cord ties without being noticed, and one only realizes they are sucking blood when scratching an itch. When they attach to pores, bleeding does not stop when removed, and their poison eventually causes sores to form. They are fearsome creatures. For those who suffer from their poison, applying a cinnabar medicine containing musk provides immediate relief from itching, pain, swelling, and inflammation. Deep indigo-dyed cloth and tobacco tar neutralize their poison. This creature is smaller in form than aquatic ones, as shown in the illustration.

When examining the medicinal texts about honey, there are four types: stone honey, tree honey, earth honey, and domestic honey. For medicinal use, nothing surpasses the finest quality tree honey. Bees make their nests in hollow spaces near the roots of large trees, opening small holes in warm southern-facing locations for entry and exit. This is common in deep mountains where no human footprints are found. What people nowadays often raise in their homes originally came from taking these wild colonies. This is called domestic honey. In Kumano, Kii Province, many people raise bees as an industry. What is called mountain honey is of the highest quality. Other provinces also produce honey. That from Tosa Province is considered good quality. After aging for years, it solidifies like white sand and does not spoil, having a rich and sweet taste.

In winter months, fearing wind and cold, they hibernate in their honeycomb chambers. During this time, they eat the honey they previously brewed and stored as sustenance. Honey is the bees' food supply. Therefore, when harvesting honey, one must leave food for them and not take everything. If everything is taken, the bees will starve to death.

These are the so-called tree honey and stone honey. Collectively, these are called mountain honey. The name "mountain honey" already appears in Sōshaku's writings. This is honey of the very finest quality. Also, honey collected from bees raised in people's homes is called domesticated honey. This is domestic honey. These bees collect flower stamens and nectar...

Cicadas Singing in the Fifth Month

　　Emerald Jade Cicada　　　　Fuzhou Prefecture Gazetteer
　　　Koromo-zemi　　ハゴロモ-zemi

　　Upon hearing this cicada's voice,
　　buckwheat seeds are sown. In Echigo province it is called
　　Sobamaki-zemi (Buckwheat-sowing Cicada),
　　and in Edo it is called Min-min-zemi.

According to the Zhengzitong: "The largest with black coloration that sings in summer with a strong voice is called jiǒng, also called mǎtiáo. The sound of mǎtiáojiǒng is mián. Those that are large with patterns and have broad, square foreheads are called qín, also called qīngqīng. The Book of Songs compares this to women's foreheads, calling them qín-heads. The Xia Xiaozheng mentions míngqū, also called hǔxiàn. Qū is the same as qín."

According to the Zhengzitong: "There is not just one type of cicada. The Erya takes tiáo as the general name for cicadas, while chán is the common term. Speaking in detail, those possessing five colors and singing before all other cicadas are called róngtiáo."

[Right folio]
Silkworms (Kaiko) - according to the Wamyōshō, in the Kantō region they are called "oko." After the Clear and Bright period in the third month, there is variation in when silkworms emerge from their egg papers (seed papers). Generally they emerge during the dragon-snake hours (7-11 AM). They are only about one bu in size, dark brown in color, with heads black and shiny like poppy seeds. These are called "ants" or "silkworms." Generally, these seed papers are soaked in cold winter water and sometimes briefly buried in snow. This is said to make their nature extremely good and the silk strong. If they hatch before the tender mulberry leaves have emerged, they will lack food, so measures are taken to prevent emergence. At such times, thread is passed through the corners of the seed papers and they are hung in well-ventilated places. Wind-drying prevents emergence. When the mulberry leaves are sufficiently extended, on a clear morning, if the seed papers are spread on the lid of a rice container, silkworm larvae will immediately hatch. If tender leaves are finely chopped with a new blade and scattered, the ascending silkworm larvae should be brushed down with bird feathers. As they grow, their color changes. In five to six days they reach over two bu in length and sometimes contract. They stop eating leaves and raise their heads as if sleeping. This is the first molt. In one day and night, they split around the mouth area and gradually shed their old skin. This is called "shedding silk." The color becomes white and beautiful. The lower half sticks to leaves while the upper half stands upright and remains motionless for a while. This is called "rising." In China this is called "first rising." Length is about three bu. On the ninth day they reach about four bu in length, and the sleep-rising is as before. This is the second molt. At this time the length is over four bu. On the fourteenth day they reach over seven bu in length and undergo sleep-rising. This is the third molt. At this time the length is about eight bu. By the nineteenth day they reach one sun two to three bu in length.

The color is white with slight yellow and luster. The sleep-rising is as before. This is the fourth molt. In China this is also called "great sleep" or "stopping sleep." At this time the length is about one sun four bu, as illustrated on the right. By the twenty-seventh day they reach about two sun two bu in length, the entire body is bluish-white with luster, and there are fine yellow-brown markings. There are nine horizontal segments, with the first segment being long and having the shape of two eyebrows on the head. On the left and right are small legs, three on each side, reddish-brown in color. On the upper front of the third segment are black spots, as if such patterns were stamped. Below the sixth and seventh segments are large legs on left and right, four on each side, with flattened wart-like tips. On the ninth segment a fleshy spine protrudes, exactly like the spine of a yam caterpillar. The tail has a split, flattened tip that can grasp branches and leaves from both sides, though it cannot function like a leg, and has slight fuzz. However, the form and color of males is as described. Females are slightly shorter and fatter, with darker color and indistinct markings. This represents their peak growth. If thick, hard mulberry leaves with deep serrations are placed in clusters above them, they immediately move and devour everything in a short time. The sound of their chewing resembles wind and rain striking tree leaves. At this time they eat mulberry most vigorously and become satiated. Therefore the interior is green, showing through as bluish-green externally. The skin is white, like white powder applied over blue. Afterward they raise their heads and stop eating. When the throat area becomes transparent segment by segment in the third and fourth segments, turning amber-colored, this is commonly called "the throat brightening" when examined closely. In Ōshū the dialectal term is "hikiru." That...

Insect closely resembling a bell cricket. Back is flat with ridges on the sides. Drawn on the 6th day of the 9th month, year of Hinoto-Ushi (1817).
　The head is narrow with a long beak curving downward like a hook, and has two short antennae. The entire body is earth-black in color without luster, the abdomen is blackish-brown, and the wings are small, folded and carried on the back. The legs are pale brown with black spots; the front legs are black, extremely narrow at the joints then suddenly swelling, and extremely narrow again at the tips.

Military fan bug (Gunbai-mushi). Commonly called "gunbai." Named thus because it resembles the shape of a military fan. Late second summer month of the year Kinoe-Inu (1814). When the Western Castle made an inquiry and I drew a sketch in response, I submitted this name. There is no Chinese name.
　The entire body is translucent like a sheet of mica. The wing veins are all hexagonal, forming a tortoiseshell pattern. Small wing-like projections below the head extend vertically upward. Although drawn realistically, the extremely intricate details are difficult to depict.
　A rare small insect of summer and autumn, smaller in form than a sesame seed. When observed through a microscope, small wing-like projections extend in three directions from the neck, appearing as if wearing a gauze cap. The white spotted areas form tortoiseshell gate patterns with fine vein-like markings resembling white mesh. Truly a wondrous creation beyond the reach of artistic skill. I record here the general outline of its form.

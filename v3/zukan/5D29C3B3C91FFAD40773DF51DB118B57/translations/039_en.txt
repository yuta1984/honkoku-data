Here I have revised and included this in the insect compendium, and the inclusion of its illustration has the same intent as placing sand hoppers (sago) in the insect section. I ask readers to forgive this.
　In Tangshan this is named sea nettle. There is a poem by Xie Zongke from the Yuan dynasty:
Layered waves embrace foam, threaded shrimp move, jellyfish contain autumn's pregnancy of earth spirits
Sea air freezes and congeals red jade brittle, heaven's cold binds purple mist fishy
Cloud garments fade color, ice saliva slippery, jade threads cooked fragrant, wine's power awakens
It must be that Chu River duckweed has truly aged, mistakenly following tidal signals falling into the vast blue sea

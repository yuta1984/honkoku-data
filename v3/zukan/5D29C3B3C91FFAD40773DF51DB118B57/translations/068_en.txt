The "yu" mentioned in the Book of Songs is the "kei-ki-chu" (valley demon insect) of the Bencao Gangmu. It has alternate names: she-gong (archer), she-ying (shadow shooter), and bao-qiang (spear bearer). According to Zang-qi's explanation, this creature is about the size of a chicken egg and resembles a dung beetle in shape. It has one horn on its head, over an inch long, with four branches at the top of the horn. Under its black shell it has wings and can fly. According to Shozo's investigation, what is illustrated below and called "kabuto-mushi" (helmet insect) in Japanese is precisely this creature. Judging from the physical description, it matches what was written above without discrepancy. The four branches on the horn resemble soap pod tree thorns, hence it is also called "saigashi-mushi." There are large and small varieties, and the four branches also vary in length and size. Some have pincer-like forms resembling crab claws, as shown in the diagram below.

Also, Shizhen says that the she-gong is two to three inches long, about an inch wide, flat in shape, broad in front and narrow behind, quite resembling a cicada in form. He also says its shape is like a turtle, and in the sixth and seventh months it has wings under its shell, can fly, and makes a "hi-hi" sound. It has a broad head with a pointed beak and two black eyes. The head has a pointed horn like a claw, one to two bu long, with six crab-like legs. Two legs have large single claws under the mouth, four... [continues to left page upper section]

This creature loves the fragrance of ripe melons. When a melon is placed nearby, it inserts its horn underneath and rolls it around. Therefore it's called "uri-korobashi" (melon roller). Children use this insect to pull small carts, like oxen pulling carts.

There are also reddish-colored ones, and some with short, small head horns. There are also those that emerge late in the season with very small forms.

The legs have small, branched claws under the abdomen. According to Shozo's investigation, what is commonly called "kappa," or "ta-game" (field turtle), or "ta-zemi" (field cicada) is this creature. Shizhen personally witnessed and wrote out this physical description with utmost detail and completeness. This is what Guangya calls "tan-ko" (short fox), what the Shi commentary calls "gan-sha" (sand-containing), and what Shi commentary calls "sui-do" (water crossbow). This is a water insect. If so, we should know there are two types of yu, with a distinction between water and land varieties. The tan-ko is sometimes eaten by dai-sagi (great egret) and oshidori (mandarin duck). In past years, when capturing a heron called "yamaga-goi," this field turtle sometimes appeared in its droppings. So it's not unusual for great egrets and similar birds to eat these creatures. This is also one of my evidential studies. In Jiangnan, where valley poisons exist, I happened to capture this insect. Its form is fierce and hideously ugly. Therefore it's said to use qi as arrows, containing sand to shoot at people's shadows, causing illness, and Chinese people greatly fear it. Japanese children catch these insects and play with them, but suffer no harm from poisonous stings. So the valley poison refers to the humid heat of deep ravines and the miasmic qi of mountain storms.

The kabutomushi (rhinoceros beetle) prefers to live on soap pod trees. It has branches on top of its head, with tips divided into four spikes, so it's commonly called the soap pod insect. Females are smaller in form, with rough, non-glossy hair on their shells. They have no horns on their heads.

Salamander　Among one species, those that are entirely pure red are rarely obtained - only one or two among ten million. On the fifteenth day of the third month of Bunka 3, year of the Fire Tiger,
　I personally observed this and drew it as a rare specimen to show to fellow
　enthusiasts.
　The red specimen has a reddish-brown color on its back,
　and a bright vermillion red color on its belly that is lovely to behold.
　Its form is somewhat smaller
　compared to ordinary ones.

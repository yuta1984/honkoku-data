Preface to the Thousand Insects Album

Medical Official Tanshu Kuriō (Kurimoto) showed me this album, saying: "This is what I have painstakingly painted over fifty years. Please give me a word." When I examined it, I found approximately one thousand several hundred species of creeping and wriggling creatures, each rendered in detail from large to small, each possessing vitality, with scholarly annotations that are clear, accurate, comprehensive, and omit nothing. His intention is to enable people to observe their forms and understand their medicinal properties, thereby serving as an aid in the use of medicines. Indeed, the master has devoted himself to arduous contemplation in the study of materia medica, and whenever he encounters any substance, he distinguishes genuine from false and corrects discrepancies. He also knows the regions where they are found, the terrain of mountains and rivers, and the fertility of the soil. The accuracy of his written discussions and the breadth of his scholarly verification are such that no one throughout the realm fails to show respect, much less myself. Faced with this work, I feel only increasing shame and amazement. If those in the world who delight in identifying natural objects were to unfold and appreciate this morning and evening, it would surely provide considerable benefit for broad learning and the identification of natural phenomena.

In years past, Eijuin Hōin frequently praised the excellence of his talents, and since then, whenever I have had occasion to test him on various matters, the breadth of his learned comprehension has been immeasurable. Therefore, when this volume was completed, he requested a preface from me. I have always been somewhat involved in the way of Japanese poetry, and while I have seen and heard of insects like bell crickets, pine crickets, and various chirping insects, I have no knowledge of the countless other species, being entirely ignorant in the path of learning and unfit for this task[...]

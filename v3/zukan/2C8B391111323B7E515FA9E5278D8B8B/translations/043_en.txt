One variety　Monkey millet

　Much cultivated in Hachioji, Musashi Province.
　The ears are green with white
　hairs. In the Yamato Honzō it states that
　autumn millet has many hairs. Wild boars and deer
　eat this, so farmers
　prefer to cultivate it.

　Water millet
　　Grass millet
　　　Hirse《Dutch-Japanese》

　There are two types of millet that
　grow wild in fields and paddies. Water millet
　grows in rice paddies. The seedling leaves
　resemble millet《field
　millet》 but are larger. The ears resemble foxtail grass
　《Pennisetum
　alopecuroides》 but are coarser and slightly reddish
　in color.

【The reading for "autumn millet" from the first character of line seven appears to be written over another erased character (possibly "shiuhai")】

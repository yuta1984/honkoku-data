Brome grass (jakubaku)　karasu-mugi　dulou grass (torōsō) 《Honzō Wamyō citing Hanron》
　　　　Avena 《Latin》　Haver 《Dutch》

Li Shizhen combined brome grass and oat as one category, but the Jiuhuang Bencao separates them into two categories. It is written as "yanyan" (swallow-kite). Now, following the explanation of Prince Zhou Ding, I will explain them separately. The large ones are called oats (yanbaku), and the small ones are called brome grass (jakubaku). Oats are the grass called natsu-no-chamugi. They grow in fields and paddies like barley, and farmers cannot distinguish them until the ears form and the grains ripen, at which point they finally pull them out. The ear shape resembles sorghum but is shorter, with several branches growing in pairs and branching, with sparsely attached bracts of three to four bu in size. They have awns and are initially green, later ripening to yellow. Brome grass is the grass called suzume-no-chahiki. There are several varieties of different sizes, abundant between field ridges and along roadsides. Each branch has one bract with awns, forming ears in clusters.

　Those with large grains and hairs are
　called ryō (liang), those with small grains and no
　hairs are called zoku (su/millet), and the glutinous varieties
　of ryō (liang) and zoku (su) are
　called shutsu (shu). There is also a type with grains
　like barnyard grass that has long hairs and is bluish-black
　in color. In years of poor harvest, it is suitable
　for eating. This is the seiryō (blue liang) mentioned in the Shūkai.
　There is also something called zatō-awa, where both the husks
　and grains have a blackish color.

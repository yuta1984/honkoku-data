　In ancient times in our country, when Coix seeds had not yet been introduced, river grain (Job's tears beads) was used as a substitute. The genuine variety was first introduced during the Kyōhō era. Since it is used medicinally and as food, what is still sold in pharmacies today is river grain (Job's tears beads). True Coix seed resembles sorghum but is narrower, similar to river grain with pale green color and alternate leaves. In autumn it grows to a height of four to five shaku, dividing into branches and leaves, producing flowers and fruits between them. The fruits are about three bu in size, shaped like a pot with a round bottom and an opening at the top. The shell has vertical striations. When rubbed, the shell comes off leaving the kernel. The kernel has a brown thin skin, and the flesh is white resembling wheat. The taste is mildly sweet. It can be cooked to make rice.

　It rarely grows wild in wastelands. It is also cultivated in households. In spring it grows from seeds. The leaves resemble those of Coix seed but are harder and deep green. In autumn it reaches a height of four to five shaku, dividing into branches and leaves with flowers. It resembles corn but is shorter. It produces seeds below the flowers. It resembles a type of shell called koyasu-gai (cowrie shell). It is larger than Coix seed and when ripe has purple-brown spots. The shell is extremely hard and cannot be crushed. There is one hole in the center. Thread can be passed through to make prayer beads. Inside the shell is a kernel, shaped like Coix seed but nearly black and hard. This is what Su Song described: "Coix grows everywhere. In spring it produces seedlings, the stem height is three to four shaku, leaves like millet leaves, opening red and white flowers, forming spikes. In the fifth and sixth months it forms seeds, bluish-white in color, shaped like beads but somewhat elongated. Therefore people call it Coix beads. Children often thread them with string, like stringing beads, for play." And what Shi Zhen said: "One variety, round with thick, hard shells, is namely bodhi seeds. Its grain is namely polished grain. It can only be pierced to make prayer beads for reciting sutras. Therefore people also call it prayer beads."

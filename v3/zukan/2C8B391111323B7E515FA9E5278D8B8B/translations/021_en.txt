　There are varieties that grow large, said to be brought by cranes to Shirakawa in Ōshū. According to Shizhen's explanation,
　One variety has grains white as frost, with a length of three to four bu. Also, in waterside villages of various provinces, where the water depth is over one jō, seedlings are inserted into soil clumps and thrown into the water. Those seedlings grow according to the water's depth. This is probably the type that Shizhen described as "water rice grows to about one jō in height, extending according to the water."

Glutinous rice (kōbei)　urushine《Wamyōshō》　uruchi《Edo》

　What has stickiness and is made into confections and rice cakes is the glutinous rice of the previous section. This section describes rice without stickiness that people commonly eat daily. Early-ripening varieties are called "wase," late ones "oku," and those in between "nakate." In the explanation of glutinous rice names, Shizhen says "there are three harvests: early, middle, and late." This is it. Shizhen says "the husks of those grains have red and white colors," some have bristles and some do not. The rice also "has red and white colors," and the red ones produce much sake with little dregs.

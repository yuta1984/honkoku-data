　It grows abundantly in fields and wetlands. In spring, leaves emerge from perennial roots forming clusters. They are elongated in shape, resembling willow leaves,
　with serrated edges. In summer, the stem extends to over one shaku in length, with densely alternate leaves that branch extensively and bear flowers. They resemble shion (Aster tataricus)
　but are smaller and white in color. Mount Yōrō in Nōshū (Mino Province) is famous for producing them. According to the Jikai commentary, Shizhen states that this flying
　mugwort belongs to the same category as chenopods (like Chenopodium album). Later, when the seeds ripen, they develop pappus and become
　airborne.

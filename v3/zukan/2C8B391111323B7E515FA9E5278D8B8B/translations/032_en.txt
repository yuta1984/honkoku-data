Sorghum (shokusho)　morокoshi 《marginal note: Edo》　toukibi 《marginal note: Honchō Shokkan》

Seeds are sown in early summer and grow to about one jō in height. The leaves are long and large, growing alternately, and resemble sugar cane in shape. In summer, it produces ears about one shaku long, branching out, flowering, and bearing fruit. The grains are round with red husks. They are ground to make rice cakes for eating.
The stalks are used to make brooms, and when burned, serve as tinder. Also, the Yamato Honzō states: "Its stems are lower than sorghum, reaching only about one to two shaku in height. The shape of the stems, leaves, and fruit do not differ from sorghum, but the taste is inferior. The Honchō Shokkan calls it tsumaguro-kibi (black-tipped millet). It is said to be the glutinous variety of ina-kibi."

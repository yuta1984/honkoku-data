　The seedlings and leaves resemble those of the opium poppy but are smaller, with slightly white hairs. The flowers are both single and double-petaled, and the flower colors are not uniform. Red double flowers are most common. The stem height is over one shaku (about 30cm). Flowers bloom in April. The fruits are also small. This is the yu meiren cao (corn poppy) described in the Jonan Garden History.

According to the Honchō Shokkan, this is a variety from the southern barbarian lands that came from Nagasaki. It is cultivated by planting seeds in early summer. Both stem and leaves are the same as sorghum, and the shape of the ear is like chimaki (rice dumplings). It has fine hair at the top, two to three sun in length. When the husks are opened, the kernels are large like fish roe. The commonly cultivated variety is yellowish-white in color. Also, what is called "nakagaurai" has extremely long kernels.

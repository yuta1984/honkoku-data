Cannabis (taima)　Hemp《marginal note: Wamyo-|sho》　wo《marginal note: same as|above}}

The stem reaches a height of seven to eight shaku. The surface is uneven, and the lower leaves have seven to eight leaves per branch. They are elongated with serrated edges and resemble leonurus
(motherwort). In the upper part, there are three leaves per branch, or one to two leaves per branch. There are male and female plants.
The male plant has flowers and bears fruit. In the "Shakumei" it is called shima (hemp fiber) and bōma (male hemp). The female plant forms
spikes, opens flowers, and bears fruit. In the "Shakumei" it is called shoma and shima. The common belief that
female plants bear fruit without flowers is an error. Among all plants and trees, there is no principle by which
fruit can exist without flowers opening. This is because the flowers are minute and not easily visible.

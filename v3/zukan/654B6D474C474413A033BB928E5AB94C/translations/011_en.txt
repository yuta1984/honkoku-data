Ju says:
Lycium has varieties in both Japan and China. What is abundant in Japan is called lycium thorn. One variety is the Chinese lycium. Very similar, but leaves and fruits slightly different. The tree has no thorns. Stone mosquito larvae are precisely lycium fruits. Chinese varieties are occasionally found in Eastern regions.

As stated in the poisonous plant section of "Wakan Sansai Zue" (Illustrated Encyclopedia of China and Japan):
Mountain azalea (Satsuki) Mountain pomegranate, Japanese name ai-zuzu-shi
[Chinese pronunciation: San chitsu chiyotsu] Rhododron, now called sa-zuki
Its flowers first bloom in April-May, reaching peak in May
People call May "nesazuki," hence the name
Mountain azalea refers to zuzu-shi. Same name but different. It would be a separate variety of zuzu-shi that blooms.

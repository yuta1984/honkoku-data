As stated in "Yamato Honzō": What is called "ayame" in ancient poems
refers to iris, not this plant. One theory holds that keison
is called ayame. Today there is a plant separately called "hana-ayame" (flower iris),
which belongs to this category. Hana-shōbu and barin are also of this type.

"Honzō Kōmoku" states that there are two types of white iris. One type grows in ponds and marshes, with large, fat white roots and sparse nodes - this is white iris. It is commonly called mud iris.
One type grows in stream wetlands, with thin red roots and rather dense nodes - this is keison. This is called water iris.

As stated in the water plant section of "Zōho Tashikihen":
White changpu (shō) [Japanese names: ayame, kusa]
[Alternative names] Water iris [Bieroku]
Stem cattail (kyōbu) [same]
[Supplementary alternative names] Water lodging (shuku) [same]
Changyang (yō) [Shiui]
Keison [same]
Ranson [Kōkei]

As stated in "Chōmonshū": During the reign of Emperor Horikawa, Ōe no Masafusa
wrote about iris and
presented it: "Waterside iris, thousand years, fifth day of fifth month"
Ōe no Masafusa. People could not interpret this. Minister Yoriyuki [at that time serving as Assistant Captain of the Left]
saw this, remained silent for a while, then found a continuation. The Emperor was deeply moved and
praised the talent of both men:
"Respectfully illuminating the iris grass of the shore,
May the color of this May last a thousand years"

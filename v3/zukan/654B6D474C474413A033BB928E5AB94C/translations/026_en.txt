The Minokasa-ō Seasonal Records states:
Nandina flower - extract the juice and soak rice in it to make crow rice, and
　　　　eating this makes one as healthy as ox sinew, hence
　　　　it is named ox sinew.

<<Chen Cangqi's explanation states>> It blooms small flowers in the fifth month. During the Cold Food Festival, its leaves are gathered and soaked in water to dye rice. The color is blue with
　　　　　luster. This is the method for blue essence rice (seiseihan) and stone hunger rice (setsukihan).
　　　　　○This tree is said to be very difficult to grow large, but in the mountains of Tosa Province there are specimens two jō in height and one shaku two or three sun in circumference.
　　　　　They are made into pillows. People commonly call these nandina pillows. The Ichinomiya shrine in Enshū is entirely covered with nandina.
　　　　　Folk tradition says that nandina eliminates bad dreams, so women insert these leaves behind their mirrors. This is
　　　　　because mirrors are associated with women's morning toilette. Later, it became common to cast nandina designs on the back of mirrors,
　　　　similar to how Chinese mirrors use rhombus flower designs, and so on.

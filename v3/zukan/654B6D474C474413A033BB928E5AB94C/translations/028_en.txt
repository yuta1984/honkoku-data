Same leaves

The (Records of Seasonal Observances) states: Daylily (kansō) is hemerocallis. Eating this makes people forget their worries.
(From the poem about sen-grass) When pregnant women wear this flower on their person, they will give birth to male children. Therefore it is called
"suitable for males" (Zhou Chu's Records of Local Customs). The original "sen-moto" is written as "sen" (諼). Sen means "to forget." The poem that says "unable to dispel worries and
thoughts by oneself" refers to cherishing this grass in order to
forget one's sorrows. People of Wu call this "worry-healing." Its leaves are like those of cattail and garlic
chives, etc. In the fifth month it sends forth stems and opens flowers. Six-petaled with four drooping,
opening in the morning and withering in the evening, etc. (The Materia Medica states) Li Jiuhua says in his Book of Longevity:
Eating the tender shoots as vegetables stirs up wind and makes people
feel drowsy as if intoxicated. Therefore it is named "forget-worries."
(The Compendium of Materia Medica states) Xuan (萱) {{from Huyuan phonetic guide}} was originally written as xuan (諼). Xuan means
"to forget." Plant this in the garden and cherish it to make one forget worries.
　Among the nine kinds of detoxifying grasses that can be eaten, daylily is indeed
one of them. Therefore it is named "deer onion." Its flowers and shoots,
when {{sweet and cooling}} made into pickles and eaten, benefit the chest,
pacify the five organs, and make people inclined to
joy and happiness, free from worry.
(The Calligraphy Manual states) Daylily varieties with petals—
eating these kills people.

[New Year's Day Plant (Ganjitsu-sou)]
The flowers are golden in color with many petals like chrysanthemums. The leaves resemble carrots.

The same flowers open again the next morning. This continues for a long time. The height ranges from one sun to five sun, and by late spring they grow to about eight or nine sun. They extend their stems, stretch their branches, and spread their leaves. They are present from January to February. They grow in mountain fields and valley bottoms. They are brought from Mount Kitayama in Omi Province. Also called Fukuju-so (Fortune and Longevity Plant), and the Chinese name is Hoshun-so (Spring-announcing Plant). In China too, it is said to bloom from the beginning of spring. Because it is the same as the spring-announcing bird (nightingale), it is called the spring-announcing plant.

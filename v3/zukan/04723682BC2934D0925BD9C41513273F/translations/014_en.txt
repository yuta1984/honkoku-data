For the undercoat of the leaves, apply grass juice thinly, then apply bear bile and malachite green thinly until it becomes the color of grass. For the undercoat of the prominent flowers, apply light blue pigment and shade with rouge. On top of this, paint with Prussian blue very finely. For the tree trunk, use wood pigment or ink to shade it black. For the moss, mix white-green and grass juice with gofun (white pigment) and let it dry.

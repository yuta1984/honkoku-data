Snake　　　　　　　　　　Chiehana Moto
The letters I write and send also coil
in spirals on the rolled paper—
the length of my accumulated feelings
is like a long serpent

Lizard　　　　　　　　　　Tonya Sakafune
The resentment of being despised—even its color
turns blue like a lizard
Though not like the fox-spirit Kuzunoha,
it crawls and clings about

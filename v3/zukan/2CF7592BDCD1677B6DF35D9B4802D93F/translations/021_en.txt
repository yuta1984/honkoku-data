"Chikinsho" (Golden Brocade Notes) states:
　Shakuchiri (Parthenocissus tricuspidata)　This is called willow-leaf shakuchiri

"Yamato Honzo" (Japanese Materia Medica) lists shakuchiri and gama men-gaki (frog face-scratcher) as separate entries. In "Chikinsho" they are treated as one plant.

"Yamato Honzo," ginseng section states:
　Celery ginseng

Because bulbil-like fruits grow between the leaves, it is also called mukago-ninjin (bulbil ginseng). "Chikinsho" also states likewise. Some people call it bamboo-joint ginseng, but this is incorrect.

Herbalists state:
　Shichiseishi (Seven-star seed/Bulbil ginseng)

Toda Kyokuzan's "Bunkai-roku" states:
　Guangdong ginseng

Chinese variety　Japanese name: Mukago-ninjin

Some incorrectly identify this plant with sanshichikon (Panax notoginseng), which is wrong. In my opinion, using shichiseishi as a substitute for Guangdong ginseng may be viable depending on the processing method of the root, but this requires further investigation. One physician states that the medicinal properties of this root surpass those of Guangdong ginseng.

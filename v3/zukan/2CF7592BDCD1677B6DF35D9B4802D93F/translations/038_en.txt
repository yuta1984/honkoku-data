"Yamato Honzō" says:
　　Sanjiko (mountain cibotium)
　　　Amana　Meuron
　　　Field lily

Jakusui says: "Now many use tetsu-shoku-ya (iron-colored arrow) and sekikyū (red spider lily) as sanjiko.
Both are incorrect. ○ I say that there are deep yellow ones from Yoshino in Yamato Province, which should be considered rare specimens.
○ Shizhen says: 'Found everywhere. Leaves grow in winter months, wither in February, one stem like an arrow shaft with white or red flowers.'"

In "Chikinsho" it is recorded as sanjigo. Below the diagram it says: "Flowers bloom in June.
Leaves emerge in early spring and wither by April," which differs from Shizhen's explanation.
Flowers span from June to July.

"Honzō-ka" says:
　Shuyōsen (Hiyodori-shōgo)　【Yōsen　Yōi　Shitsuko-sō. Named so because it can treat lacquer sores】
　　Shuyōsen is commonly called uru-shi-kai-shi-ya, but its form
　　resembles hakuei. Also, using setsu-ka-kō as hakuei, the form greatly differs. Names are con-
　　fused in memory, which is questionable.

hiyodori-jōgo. Thrushes also favor it, hence called tsukumi-no-iine (thrush rice)."

According to "Honzō Wakkai"
　Shiso (Perilla frutescens)　Alternative names　Sekiso (red perilla)　Keijin
　　　　　　　So
　　　　Japanese name　Norae

　"Yamato Honzō"
　　In the collected explanations of shiso in "Honzō Kōmoku," Shizhen says that there is now
　　one variety called flower shiso. Its leaves have fine teeth densely
　　arranged, looking as if they were cut and shaped. The fragrance, color, stem, and seeds are all
　　no different. People
　　call it Kaikaiso. This shiso exists in mountains and fields, and its form,
　　nature, and taste do not differ from shiso. Only the leaves are fine, and
　　the stem and seeds are also fine. The fragrance
　　is even more
　　intense compared to ordinary shiso. What Shizhen calls
　　flower shiso is probably
　　this.

"Yamato Honzō"
　There is what people commonly call Korean shiso. The stem and leaves
　do not differ from ordinary shiso, but both front and back are
　purple in color, and the fragrance is superior. The seeds come
　from Korea. This is today's crepe shiso.
　Among crepe shiso leaves, there are those where both front
　and back are blue in color.
　People commonly call this blue shiso. There are also those where the back of the leaf is blue and
　the front is purple. This is called one-sided shiso. There is also early
　shiso. It bears fruit at the end of March.
　This is a different variety, not reaching one shaku in height.
　The spikes are long.

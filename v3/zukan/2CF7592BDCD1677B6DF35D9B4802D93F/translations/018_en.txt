"Zōho Tashikihen" (Expanded Botanical Dictionary), Wetland Grass Plants section, records:
　Ro (Reed) 〈Japanese name〉〈Upon examination, Yoshi〉〈Supplementary alternative name〉I (Reed)
　　The reed flower is called Hōnō 〈Chinese text〉
　　The shoots are called Kwan

"Honzō Kōmoku" (Compendium of Materia Medica) states: Generally, newly sprouted reeds are called ka (葭),
those that have not yet produced ears are called ro (芦), and those that have grown tall are called i (葦). There are
several varieties, and those that are about one jō (10 feet) tall, hollow inside with thin bark,
and white in color are ro (芦) 〈also葦 and 葭〉
○Upon examination: Ro (芦) 〈Japanese name ashi〉 is an abbreviation of the Japanese reading "aoshi" (blue)
　I (葦) 〈commonly called yoshi〉 is an abbreviation of the Japanese reading "yowashi" (weak)
Reed flowers 〈called Hōnō, also named chō〉 According to "Setsumun" (Analytical Dictionary), reed
　flowers are called chō. They extend stems, sway in the distance, produce blossoms,
　but have no chaff or calyx. Present-day people gather them to make
　brooms, called chō-bōki (reed brooms). This is it.

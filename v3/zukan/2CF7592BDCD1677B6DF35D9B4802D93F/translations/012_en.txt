This name is recorded as some person's explanation, and
commonly everyone calls it scrophularia

Examining the explanation in "Bencao Gangmu":
Although it doesn't match scrophularia, the explanation
of Dijincao has some validity as a reference point. Still considering,
scrophularia's flowers resemble those of mountain small vegetable.
Indeed, its flowers are white-blue. Mountain
small vegetable is thus called mountain scrophularia.

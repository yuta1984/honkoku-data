"Yamato Honzō" states:
　　Winter melon (Kamo-uri)

　"Kamo" is the Japanese name for felt (mōsen) (according to "Jun Wamyōshō").
　The character for felt is read as "kamo (mo/flourishing)." Also in the "Shūishū"
　there is a record of someone requesting kamo for a cart.
　It is felt spread inside carts. This melon, when
　winter arrives, has white hair resembling felt, hence it is
　named Kamo-uri.
I say:
　This winter melon has white hair on its leaves and stems with a very fragrant aroma.
　When struck by hand, it gives off a good fragrance that scents the hand.

Someone said that this is called Sōran-haku Koran.
This explanation is not detailed. This grass naturally
grows abundantly in fields and gardens. The leaves resemble shallots and have a purplish tinge.
The leaves do not wither in winter, and the roots are like those of narcissus. The flowers form
spikes and are pale red with a purplish tinge. This description fits well with
this plant.　From my collection "Yamato Honzō"

There is also one variety with red fruit called Ryūju, but
"Honzō" says this variety has not yet been seen in Japan. However, "Chikinsho" presents
an illustration of Ryūju grass. Since it is said to be a type of Ryūki grass,
might it also exist in Japan? This should be copied and examined further.

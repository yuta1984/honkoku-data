　Stone garlic - its flower is commonly called manjushage in our country. Honshaku-myōgi commentary says:
　Manjusha means soft here, also called red flower. In "Yōyō Zasso" the golden lantern grass (summer daffodil)
　is disliked by common people planting in homes. Also called mugi grass. When there are flowers,
　there are no leaves; when there are leaves, there are no flowers. Stone garlic and mountain arrowhead all have flowers
　when there are no leaves, and leaves when there are no flowers. These are also flowers planted in homes.

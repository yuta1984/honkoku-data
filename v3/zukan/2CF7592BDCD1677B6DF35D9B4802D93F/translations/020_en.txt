"Yamato Honzō" (Japanese Materia Medica) states:
　　Ōka (Trichosanthes cucumeroides)
　　　The fruit resembles bundled letters
　　　Therefore it is called tamatsusa (jeweled letter)
　　　Common people call it karasuri (crow melon)
　　　Also katsurou is called karasuri
　　　but this is different

"Zōho Tashikihen" (Expanded Botanical Dictionary), Vine Plants section states:
　Ōka 〈Japanese name〉〈Hisagofuri, examining now it is Karasufuri〉〈Supplementary alternative names〉Doka 〈Honkyō〉
　　　Hook 𧁾 〈Guo Pu〉Old crow melon 〈Zukyō〉Horse bottle gourd 〈pronounced like hail〉
　　　Red hail seed 〈Engi〉Wild sweet melon 〈Kōmoku〉Teacher-aunt grass 〈Doshuku〉
　　　Grandfather's whiskers

"Bencao Gangmu" (Compendium of Materia Medica) says it blooms yellow five-petaled flowers in the sixth and seventh months, but this does not match. Its roots and fruits all correspond well to ōka. The seeds within the fruit shell resemble tamatsusa (letters) 〈In Japan, rolled and sealed letters are called tamatsusa〉. People erroneously consider this and katsurou to be the same plant, and the Japanese names are also confused, which is incorrect. Indeed, katsurou is 〈hisagouri〉, and ōka is precisely old crow melon 〈karasouri〉. The Japanese names are naturally distinct.

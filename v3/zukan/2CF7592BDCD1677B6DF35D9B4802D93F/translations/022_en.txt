"Wamyo Ruiju-sho" (Japanese Names Classification) states:
　Chiyu (Ayametamu) 【Left ruby: Ehisune】

Tao Yinju's "Honzo-chu" (Materia Medica Commentary) states:
Chiyu has the alternate name gyokushi. The Japanese name is ayametamu, ehisune.
The seeds are black and resemble fermented black beans (shi), hence the name.

Kyokutei-shi's "Saijiki" (Seasonal Records) states: Chiyu (waremokou) is also written as "I too am red" (ga-mo-kou). Those resembling miscanthus are true waremokou. Chiyu is read as nokogirikusa (saw grass) or hagoromogusa (feather robe grass). "Honzo" states it is thin and long like saw teeth. It blooms in the seventh month. Like mulberry fruit, it is purple-black in color. "Tettsui-sho" states that waremokou is fujibakama (Eupatorium). I say these explanations are contradictory. Hagoromogusa is indeed nokogirikusa, recorded in "Chikin-sho." Chiyu is gyokushi. To also call it fujibakama - indeed this theory requires examination. "Yamato Honzo" states that chiyu is waremokou. To call nokogirikusa chiyu is incorrect. This should be examined. There is also another waremokou that resembles miscanthus, with flowers similar to reed grass. This is recorded in the true sketch separate volume.

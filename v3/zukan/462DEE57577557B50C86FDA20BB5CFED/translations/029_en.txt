Postscript
The seasonal flowers that were omitted from this book will be included in a later volume and published. Generally speaking, this book is not limited to vase flower arrangements (ikebana) alone, but since it may benefit those who appreciate plants, or those involved in painting, carving, and other arts, I hope for the discerning perusal of such readers.

Continuation of Tea Ceremony Flower Arrangement Collection - Complete in One Volume
Collecting flowers omitted from the previous volume, covering how to preserve flowers, the good and bad qualities of flowers, the coordination of flower vessels, and other floral illustrations published in color.

1. Although the flowers of the four seasons are divided into twelve months, they are not uniform due to the warmth of spring each year and the yin-yang aspects of the land. First, when seeking flowers for a particular time, one should survey that month along with the previous and following months. From these three months, one can obtain flowers suitable for arrangement. This is because flowers bloom early or late depending on the season, so the current month alone is insufficient.

Even unmarked flowers, if they are rare, may be equivalent to marked flowers. However, tea practitioners do not forcibly seek difficult flowers; even if they are common flowers, the custom is to appreciate those with clean stems and leaves, half-open with buds mixed in beautifully.

1. This book was compiled by the old master Kakien, and I further requested Master Iwasaki Kanken to correct the Chinese names and make deletions, revisions, and additions. However, much of the master's previous knowledge remains. Moreover, plants and trees have many alternative names. Here I record only the commonly used names.

1. The flower illustrations at the end of the volume are not all rare flowers. Those not commonly found in flower shops and rarely arranged in tea gatherings are shown in illustrations, which best convey Master Kanken's paintings. Due to my shallow learning, the flowers that should be illustrated...

According to "Sōmoku Ikushu" (Plant Cultivation):
　　　Murasaki-omoto (Purple Rohdea)
　　　Shikin-ran (Purple-gold orchid) - Osaka dialect

　　　　　　　　　The Shikin-ran has leaves that resemble those of omoto, with green surfaces
　　　　　　　　　and purple undersides throughout. The flowers resemble a clam shell split in two. The leaves
　　　　　　　　　dislike winter. This does not resemble omoto. Since it is something that has appeared recently,
　　　　　　　　　it is not mentioned in the pharmacological texts.

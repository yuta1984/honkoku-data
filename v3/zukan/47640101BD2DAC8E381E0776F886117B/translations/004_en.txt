                                      breaking off a branch to draw one illustration

From the poisonous plants section of Tashiki-hen:
　　Hakurakkai (hakurakayu) <<Supplementary>>

From Yamato Honzō:
　　Shishiyaki grass, also called Wa-ōgon
　　　　　　　　In Edo it is called sasayake

From Bukō Sanbutsu-shi:
　　Hakurakkai (shishiyaki-gusa)　chanabagiku
　　　　　　　sasayaki-gusa

　　　　　　　　Kan's opinion:
　　　　　　　　　As recorded in the Wakan Sansai Zue under the entry for castor plant,
　　　　　　　　　the plant called hakurakkai that grows in the mountains and valleys of Jiangnan
　　　　　　　　　has stems and leaves resembling those of the castor plant, with hollow stems that
　　　　　　　　　make sounds when blown through.
　　　　　　　　　This is the origin of the name hakurakkai. It has yellow sap, and its leaves are
　　　　　　　　　similar to but slightly different from those of the castor plant. According to Yamato Honzō,
　　　　　　　　　the leaves resemble chrysanthemum leaves but are thick, with the undersides
　　　　　　　　　white as if covered with frost. When the stem is
　　　　　　　　　broken, yellow sap emerges. This description matches well.
　　　　　　　　　It is highly poisonous and can cause death where people stand.
　　　　　　　　　It must not be used for bathing. This agrees with Shizhen's explanation. There are theories
　　　　　　　　　that hakurakkai is not related to coptis.

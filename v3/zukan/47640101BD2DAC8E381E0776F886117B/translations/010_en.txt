The Zoho Chikinsho states that Chinese orange (karatachibana) is a different plant. It refers to the hereditary tachibana.
It is a type of citrus, and although kayatoka (kara-tachibana) is commonly called tachi-hana by the people,
it does not contain the character for tachibana (orange).

Geranium grows abundantly in various mountain and field locations. It grows in
the plains of Sugamo and Tokumaru in Buko (Edo). This plant's leaves, stems, and flowers are shade-
dried and ground into powder, then taken with hot water. It treats dysentery and is
especially effective for bloody dysentery. It can also be prepared as a decoction or ground into fine powder to make pills.
All methods are effective. Therefore it is called gennoshoko (proven effectiveness). Although the materia medica lists it among
poisonous plants, it is non-toxic. For dysentery, this geranium alone
can be taken effectively. The frequency should be controlled. The Yamato Honzo also records
its efficacy.

Wild geranium
The Jiuhuang states: Geranium species, Fighting bull plant ○Renkeso
　　　　　　　　　　　　　○Houtsuke-bana
　　　　　　　　　　　　　○Miyushi-kusa
Polygonum aviculare: Haiikuwaso
　　　Umegaeso

The Wakan Sansai Zue and various other books state:
　　Geranium, wild geranium, and another species are treated as three separate plants, but all records are confused.
　　These three are actually one species. True Polygonum aviculare is a separate, different plant.

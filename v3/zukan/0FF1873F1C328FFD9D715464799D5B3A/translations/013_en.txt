Listed in the shrub section of "Zōho Tashiki-hen"
　　　Mokutenryō (Actinidia polygama)　Japanese name is Watatabi, now
　　　　　　　upon examination it's Matatabi

　　　Fujītenryō (vine-type Actinidia)　There are two types of tenryō: wood and vine

According to "Wamyō Ruijushō"
　　　Mokutenryō　According to Nahanron, the Japanese name for Mokutenryō is Watatabi

　　　　　　　　　　According to the shrub section of "Wakan Sansai Zue"
　　　　　　　　　　　　　Fujītenryō　Now called Matatabi
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　There are three types, among them Mokutenryō and
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Kotenryō are not numerous

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　In the third and fourth months, white flowers bloom, resembling plum blossoms
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　At that time

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Day after Yakuro in the 5th month, year of the Wood Rooster
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sketched from life at Kinka Garden

According to "Yamato Honzō"
　　　Fujītenryō　Also called Natsu-ume (summer plum)

　　　　Regarding Matatabi, in the pharmacological texts, Su Gong's theory states that Mokutenryō forms vine-like growth,
　　　　resembles Chinese mulberry with white flowers, and fruits like jujube but without fixed form. The flesh is like eggplant, with a spicy taste, eaten as
　　　　a substitute for ginger or smartweed. This is undoubtedly Matatabi. Su Song also said that what Su Gong
　　　　described is Fujītenryō. Therefore, what Su Gong described is not Mokutenryō
　　　　but Fujītenryō. Chen Cangqi and Shizhen say there are three types
　　　　of tenryō: ○Mokutenryō ○Kotenryō ○Fujītenryō. In Japan, we don't know of the other
　　　　two types existing. What we have in Japan is Fujītenryō. What's listed in the shrub section of pharmacological texts
　　　　are Mokuryō and Koryō, which are trees. What we have in Japan is not a tree but a climbing woody vine.
　　　　This is Fujītenryō. Mokutenryō will be described in a later volume.

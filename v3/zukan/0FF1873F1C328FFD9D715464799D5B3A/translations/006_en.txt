According to "Honzō" (Medicinal Plants):
Ōseishin (Japanese name) ōemi, yamaemi
The "Wamyō Ruijushō" also states the same

According to "Zōho Tashikihen Sansō-rui" (Expanded Multi-Knowledge Collection: Mountain Plants):
Ōseishin (Japanese name: ōemi, current common name: aushi) (Expanded alternative names) Ōshi ("Zuisōkyō")
Jutsushi ("Gofukyō") Tochiku ("Betsuroku") Rokchiku (same)
Sennin Yoryō ("Kōkei") Kyūkyūsō ("Betsuroku") Beiho ("Mōsen")
Yaseishōkyō (same) Jūrō ("Betsuroku") Keikaku (same)
Ryūgai ("Kōga") Suishu

Ōseishin and Izui are similar. Ōseishin has blue stems with a slight
purple tinge, while Izui has purple-red stems. The roots of Izui
are thin and long like stems, resembling peach branches. In Kyoto
it is called "karasu-yuri" and is also called "amatokoro" for this reason.
Ōseishin resembles something dumpling-shaped,
so it is called "amatokoro." This explanation is most reasonable. In flower arrangement it is
called "tsuyukusa." Zōki said "Those growing irregularly and not in pairs are called
hensei, while those with opposite leaves are called sei." This name is
not recorded in the collected writings. Looking now, small opposite leaves are extremely
rare, and all leaves are opposite. The "Yamato Honzō" also
confirms this.

According to "Hakubutsushi" (Records of Natural Phenomena), long ago, the Yellow Emperor asked Tenrō, saying "Among things born of heaven and earth, is there something that, if eaten,
would make humans immortal?" Tenrō replied "The grass of the great yang is named ōseishin, and eating it
enables long life. The grass of the great yin is called kōfun (dog's mouth), and it must not be eaten. If it enters the mouth,
one dies instantly. People believe that kōfun kills humans, but do not believe that ōseishin extends lifespan.
Is this not also a delusion?"

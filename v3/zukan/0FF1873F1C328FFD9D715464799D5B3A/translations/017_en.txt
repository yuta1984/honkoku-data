In the "Wakan Sansai Zue" (Illustrated Encyclopedia of China and Japan), in the section on tall trees, it says regarding the Sala Twin Trees:
In the "Fanyi Mingyi Ji" (Collection of Translated Names and Meanings), it says that "Sala" means "firm and solid" here. Because it does not wither in winter or summer, it is named "firm and solid." In the phonetic interpretation of the "Avatamsaka Sutra," it is translated as "distant." When Buddha entered Nirvana, the twin trees in all four directions drooped down to cover the Tathagata, and those trees became sorrowful and all turned white.

Upon examination, "Sala" is the original name. "Twin trees" refers to a grove. Commonly, it is called "Sala Twin Trees." The "Xiyang Zazu" says that the flowers of the Sala tree are like lotus flowers. This is different from our tree. There is also one specimen at Hasedera Temple in Yamato.

In the "Jikinsho" it says:
Shara Twin Trees ○ Also called Yabu-tsubaki (bush camellia)
This name does not appear in various books

In the "Yamato Honzo" it says:
Shara Tree
This flower opens in the morning and wilts in the evening. This explanation is also recorded in the "Jikinsho." The leaves are said to resemble camellia leaves, which fits well. Is this truly the Shara tree? The "Senkyaku Ruisho" also records the Shara tree.

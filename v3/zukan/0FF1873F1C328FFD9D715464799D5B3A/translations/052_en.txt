Hinoe-inu year, Suihin month, 12th day
Copied

"Chikin-shō" states:
　　　Chinese Hosta (tō-gibōshi)

"Yamato Honzō" states:
　　　Sedum (nobiki-yashi) - commonly called "Fire Extinguisher"
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Hinoe-inu year, summer, 5th month
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　13th day, copied

"Wakan Sansai Zue," Stone and Grass section, states:
　　　Wall-growing grass (itsumade-gusa) - Ten Thousand Year Grass

　　　　　　Gyokuhaku is also called Ten Thousand Year
　　　　　　Grass, but the character for "grass" is distinguished
　　　　　　only by its on-reading and kun-reading
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　"Yamato Honzō"
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Garden Grass section states:

　　　Bean grass (mame-sō) - common name

　　　　　Because its leaf shape resembles a bean
　　　　　split in two, it is called bean grass.
　　　　　Some also call it rock bean.
　　　　　What is called bean grass is a different species.

I say, examining various texts:
　Sedum has leaves resembling purslane but without root hairs.
　When pinched, it lives well and blooms yellow flowers in the 4th and 5th months. It is
　the same as Buddha's nail grass (nenashi-kusa).
　However, Buddha's nail grass has long leaves with pointed tips, while sedum
　has round leaves without root hairs, and their vitality is similarly strong.
　Some call this wall-growing grass. "Wall-growing" (itsumade) is named for its longevity.
　However, "Chikin-shō" states that wall-growing grass resembles ivy and grows well attached to walls,
　which makes this a different species. Whether these two grasses share one name, there are many of this type. The explanation of sedum
　accords well with common usage, and all call it bean-shaped grass (mame-sō).

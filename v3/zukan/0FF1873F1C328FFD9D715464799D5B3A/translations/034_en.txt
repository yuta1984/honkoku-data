The "Chikin-shō" states:
　　　Aridōshi　This tree has many fine thorns, so although birds
　　　　　　　like the fruit, they fear the thorns and do not eat it. Hence it is also
　　　　　　　called "tori-tomarazu" (birds do not perch)

The "Wakan Sansai Zue," Chinese Trees section, states:
　　　Suikaku (蕤核)　　　Hakuda　Sui and Da are the same
　　　　　Commonly called "tori-tomarazu" (birds do not perch)

The "Jiuhuang Bencao" states:
　　　Ruihe　Commonly named Ruizi

"Kihin-kyō":
　　　Koibara　　Should be investigated

　　　　　　　The same book states:
　　　　　　　　　I believe that in the "Wamyō-shō," reading "da" as "tara" is incorrect. "Tara" refers to Aralia.
　　　　　　　　　Suikaku has leaves resembling those of Chinese wolfberry, and the leaves are also small, round, and long,
　　　　　　　　　resembling boxwood. It produces white flowers, and there are many thorns among the branches and leaves, so birds
　　　　　　　　　cannot come and perch on it. Therefore, it is commonly called "tori-tomarazu."
　　　　　　　　　This is probably Suikaku.
　　　　　　　　　　I believe the "Chikin-shō" presents the same theory, and it also writes that the leaves resemble boxwood,
　　　　　　　　　　and each source agrees well. Everyone does not know to call it Suikaku,
　　　　　　　　　　but exclusively calls it Aridōshi.
　　　　　　　　　　The "Jiuhuang Tu" differs greatly, and the leaf shape also does not match. However, the resemblance
　　　　　　　　　　to Chinese wolfberry and other aspects all correspond.

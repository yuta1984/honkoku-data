"Jiuhuang Bencao" (Famine Relief Materia Medica) states:
　　　Bamboo-joint vegetable (aobana)　Also named Jade Butterfly, also named Jade Moth Eyebrow
　　　《Marginal note: tsuyukusa》　　Also named Bamboo Flower　Also named Japanese Blue Grass

　　　Light bamboo leaf (tsuyukusa)　Re-copied
　　　　　　　　　What is called light bamboo leaf is a different species
　　　　　　　　　Called sasukusa, has chain-like seeds

"Wakan Sansai Zue" (Illustrated Encyclopedia of Chinese-Japanese Nature) in the section on dayflower states:
　　　　　　Upon examination, dayflower (chikuri aobana) 《Marginal note: Japanese name tsukikusa》 commonly called chikusa, with its flower
　　　　　　juice of concentrated type, they dye Kōya blue masks and call the paper "blue flower" to make painting brushes

My analysis:
　　　Jade Butterfly (suikochō) is probably a type of dayflower. In "Wakan
　　　Sansai Zue" it is recorded separately. However, all the descriptions
　　　correspond well to light bamboo leaf. "Jiuhuang Bencao" is also
　　　the same. These are the same species with different names,
　　　not separate entities. There is another one called jade butterfly, which is probably
　　　a type of jade butterfly. However, the flower colors differ only in
　　　yellow versus jade green. In our country we have not yet heard of it, but we should
　　　investigate and research it further in the future.

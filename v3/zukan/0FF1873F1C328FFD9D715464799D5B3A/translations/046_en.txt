Shikana (Deer vegetable)


"Yamato Honzō" [Japanese Pharmacopeia] in the section on miscellaneous plants states:
　　　Inu-kyōkatsu (Dog notopterygium)　In Tsukushi it is called shikana
　　　　　　 　What is commonly called shikana is probably this. It resembles kyōkatsu (udo)
　　　　　　 　and is said to have a delicious taste, but I have not yet experienced its flavor

　　　　　In the poems of "Shūi-shū" [Collection of Gleanings], shikana is mentioned, probably referring to this plant

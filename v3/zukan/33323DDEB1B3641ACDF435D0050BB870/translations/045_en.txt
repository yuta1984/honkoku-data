There are both large and small flowers. When the leaves first emerge they are blue-green, and some change to red. There is also one called Yoshino. From the calyx to the stamens it is blue-green. Those with about three or four layers overlapping and attached are called Yama-kirigaya. Generally, mountain cherries have sparse flowers.

From the Fuboku-shū collection　　　　　　Nakamasa
Among the countless people who compete to visit the mountain cherry,
Let your heart go through the valleys of melancholy

○Elder Kassho says: Single-petaled with white color and short stems. There are two types - sparse and dense flowering. Those that bloom densely have large flowers and resemble Kirigaya. They are also named Kaba-zakura (Birch Cherry).

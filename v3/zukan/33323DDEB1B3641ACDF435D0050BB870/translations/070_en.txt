Satsuma Hi-zakura (Satsuma Scarlet Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Igensei says: There is a variety called hi-zakura in Satsuma. Though the name is the same, the flower form is greatly different. It is found at a place called "Michino-shima" on the route from Kagoshima in Satsuma Province to the Ryukyu Islands. The flowers reach their peak during Shōgen (the 15th day of the first lunar month). It begins to bud from winter.

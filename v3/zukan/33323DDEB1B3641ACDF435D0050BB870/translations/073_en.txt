Taizan-bukun (Mount Taishan Lord)
[Illustration]

○ Igan-sai says: It is exactly the same as Toranoo (Tiger's Tail). However, the branches have curves, and the branches connect to reach the tips, with flowers attaching sparsely. Between individual branches there are interruptions, and they do not cluster in one place. Taizan and Toranoo are of one variety but separate.
○ According to Kassho-ō's Cherry Compendium: It has a thousand petals, is slightly red, with large flowers like red plum blossoms. Leaves are rarely present.
○ Don'ei says: Taizan-bukun appears in the Genpei Seisuiki (Rise and Fall of the Minamoto and Taira)

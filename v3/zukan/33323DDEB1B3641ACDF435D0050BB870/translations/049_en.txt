Kirigayatsu (Kirigayatsu Cherry)
[Illustration]

○Igansai says: Also called Yae-hitoe (Double-Single), and also called Kurumaga-eshi (Cart Return). This is the finest variety among cherry blossoms. On a single branch, double-petaled and single-petaled flowers bloom mixed together. Among these, there are many double flowers and few single ones. It resembles Edo cherry but the color is lighter. Edo cherry is entirely double-petaled. Kirigayatsu has both double and single petals mixed together. Originally this tree came from Kirigayatsu in Kamakura, hence the name. An old man said that regarding this flower, one person claimed it was double-petaled while another insisted it was single-petaled, leading to an argument. Unable to settle the dispute, the two men turned their cart around to look again, and saw that on one tree there were both double and single [flowers mixed together].

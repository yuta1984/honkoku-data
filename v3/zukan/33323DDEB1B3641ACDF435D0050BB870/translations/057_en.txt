Kokonoe-zakura (Nine-fold Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Igan-sai says: The flower form is the same as Kiritani, being double-flowered, but with somewhat more layering. Therefore it is called "nine-fold."

Asagi-zakura (Light Yellow Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Igan-sai says: The flowers are the size of Kiritani and bloom at the same time as Kiritani in particular. They are single-petaled and white in color, with very green sepals. The flowers are not truly yellow - the petals appear blue when reflected against the sepals. This is namely the green-sepaled drooping-thread crabapple.

Kaidō-zakura (Crabapple Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Igan-sai says: The flowers are the same as Kiritani, with a subtle color resembling crabapple flowers. There exists something called sakura-kaidō (cherry crabapple), but this is not a cherry. It is described in detail in the appendix.

Senmoto-zakura (Thousand Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Igan-sai says: The "thousand cherries" spoken of at Yoshino, Arashiyama and other places does not refer to a single tree, but to a great number of them. What is illustrated here is one variety. The flowers are double with a slight reddish tinge. The flower form roughly resembles Kiritani but is a little smaller.

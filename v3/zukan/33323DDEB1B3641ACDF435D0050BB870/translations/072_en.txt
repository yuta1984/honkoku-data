○ Igan-sai says: It has a thousand petals and blooms densely on branches.
It is like a ball. The branches have no curves. The flowers open the latest.
This should indeed be called Reishi-kaidō. The flowers are
the same as Taizan, but Taizan has curved branches and flowers
that attach sparsely.
○ According to Kassho-ō's Cherry Compendium, it is the same as Kiritani, slightly
red. The branches are long, clustering in bunches, with sparse areas.

It is named after its resemblance to the striped pattern of a tiger's tail.
○ Don'ei says there is also something called Beni-toranoo (Red Tiger's Tail). The flower shape
is no different from Toranoo. It is just something with
deep red color.

Uba-zakura (Old Woman Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Igansai says: It is the same as the equinox cherry (higan-zakura). However, it was named for having no leaves. "Ha" (leaf) and "ha" (tooth) share the same pronunciation in Japanese. This is recorded in Elder Kassho's cherry catalog.
○According to Elder Kassho's cherry catalog: The stem is short, flowers grow densely clustered, and there are no leaves. It was named after the meaning of an old woman having no teeth. The flowers bloom later than the equinox cherry.
○Dōnei says: The flowering is later than Kirigayatsu cherry. It blooms at the same time as scarlet cherry and Edo cherry. However, the "Uba-higan" mentioned in the section on equinox cherry and this Uba-zakura are different varieties.

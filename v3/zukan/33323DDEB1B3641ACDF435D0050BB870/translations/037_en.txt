It was named after the story of Kumagai Naozane and Taira no Atsumori taking the lead at the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani. It is also said that someone mentioned there is a thousand-petaled variety that resembles double cherry blossoms. This is not the Kumagai cherry. This is what gardeners call Yōkihi (Yang Guifei). It resembles scarlet cherry but is smaller. Also, calling the single-petaled large-flowered variety with reddish coloring that resembles what is called Shibayama as "Kumagai" is also incorrect.

This is what is called Sakate (reverse hand) cherry.
○Elder Kassho said: It is the pioneer among cherry blossoms. It opens its flowers in the second month, preceding the equinox cherry. The flowers are small and double, with a slightly red color.

blooming mixed together. Both explanations that each person gave were correct. Therefore it was named Kurumaga-eshi (Cart Return). It is the finest among cherries. Edo cherry is also a variant of this Kirigayatsu. However, Kirigayatsu scatters readily without lingering attachment to falling petals, which is pleasant. Edo cherry is not inferior in flower quality but does not scatter, instead withering while attached to the branch. In this regard, Kirigayatsu is considered superior. Elder Kassho also called it the finest cherry variety, with white color slightly tinged with crimson and the longest stems. Also, at Jion-ji temple in Sakai, Senshu Province, there is

a cherry called Kurumaga-eshi, but this is not a fine variety.
○Donnei says: In a place called Aimura in Tsu Province, there is one large tree in the middle of a rice field. The flowers are double like Kirigayatsu. Each year they bloom with one less layer of petals, becoming single-petaled every eighth year. Every ninth year they return to the original double form. This is also called Yae-hitoe (Double-Single). It is the same species with the same name but a different plant.

There is one that was grown from the seeds of the young tree cherry of Suma.
It blooms from spring to autumn, with no flowers in winter. In summer, around the fifth and sixth months, young buds emerge and flowers bloom on the branches while leaves flourish.
In spring, it is said to bloom earlier than mountain cherry. The flowers are single-petaled
and small, with small leaves and thin branches. It produces flowers without exceeding one shaku in height. There are also double-flowered varieties that bloom in all four seasons. Within one plant there are buds, some in bloom,

some with fallen petals, some with young leaves, and some with fallen leaves. In Sunshū, there are various places where this type can be found. Also, regarding the aforementioned Sechie-zakura, also called Jūrokunichi-zakura (Sixteenth Day Cherry),
when I inquired about this meaning with local people in Yoshū, they said it does not bloom in all four seasons but blooms particularly on the sixteenth day of the first month. It is said to be found on the mountainside of Ryūon Temple in Yamakoshi Village, Wake District of the same province.

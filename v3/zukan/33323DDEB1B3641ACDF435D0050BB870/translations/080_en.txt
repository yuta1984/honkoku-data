○ Donnei says: "It is double-flowered with a pale pink color. The petals are broad and large. The stem is thin and long. This temple is located in Mikawa Province. Is it perhaps a tree that originated from this place? It is also written as Hōraiji."

Shiogama

○ Igan-sai says: "It is double-flowered, with flowers and leaves appearing mixed together. It has small blooms and the flower shape appears as if withered. Because the petals have wrinkles, they appear withered. It is the same as what is called 'Tōyama' among peonies. The flowers droop slightly."

According to the records, Sakuramachi-no-Chūnagon (Minister Sakuramachi) grieved that the peak blooming of this flower lasted only a few days, so he worshipped Taizan-bukun and extended the flower's lifespan for twenty-one days.
　　Since the deity is a living god who shakes the sacred hemp,
　　　The flower's lifespan has indeed been extended
The Man'yōshū also contains a poem saying that the peak of flower blooming passes in seven days.

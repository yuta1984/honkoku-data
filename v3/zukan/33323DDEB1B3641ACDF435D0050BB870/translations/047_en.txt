Yuki-yamazakura (Snow Mountain Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Ton'ei says: It has medium-sized flowers and is white
in color like snow.
However, the flower shape is exactly
the same as Uba-zakura (Old Woman Cherry).
If one makes a mistake, it could be confused
with Uba-zakura.

Ichimonji (One Character)
[Illustration]
○Igan-sai says: The flowers are white in color.
It is a mountain cherry with large flowers. Single-petaled,
with neither curling back nor cupping inward. When the flower
opens, the petals are flat. Therefore
it is called Ichimonji (One Character).

Seeds exist in other regions, and by grafting them, they flourish again.
They are also found in Geishū Hiroshima and Banshū Akashi,
where the locals call them Fudan-zakura (Perpetual Cherry). They are all the same plant.
Their flower shape resembles that of Higan cherry and Uba cherry.
The flowers bloom in clusters. They invariably bloom around New Year.
Since they bloom continuously throughout the four seasons, the local people call them Fudan-zakura. Upon examination,
this is precisely what is referred to as

Shōtōkō (Small Peach Red) in Song dynasty Lu You's "Record of Old Learning Studio."
Though it shares the same name as the balsam flower, it is a different plant.
Kumagaya cherry is also of this type. Ouyang Xiu's
collected works all contain poems about small peach blossoms. Ouyang Xiu's
poem says:
　　Flowers bloom in snow but people do not yet recognize them　Plucking them and looking at each other, we together
　　marvel and wonder　One should seek wine and get drunk before the flowers　First seeing this
　　year's first branch

[Note ①: "蘩" is an error for "繁"]
[Note ②: Either "土人 (dojin)" or "古人 (kojin)"]
[Note ③: One character may be superfluous. Perhaps "One should seek wine and get drunk before the flowers"]

Initially, I thought there was merely one type of peach blossom that bloomed early, but when I traveled to Chengdu, I first came to know what is called "small peach." It immediately produces flowers around New Year, and its appearance resembles that of weeping begonia. Zeng Gong's miscellaneous records state "On the twentieth day of the first month, we appreciated small peach at Tianzhang Pavilion," which refers precisely to this.

As recorded. Also, there is a cherry tree in the garden of Shiroko Kannon Temple in Ise that blooms in all four seasons and is named Fudan-zakura (Perpetual Cherry). When I inquired with the local people, it is the same as those found in Akashi and Hiroshima.

It is the same plant. What is recorded in Yang Shen's "Comprehensive Record of Cinnabar and Lead" from Lu You's "Record of Old Learning Studio" refers precisely to this plant. It is written as both "small peach" and "small peach red," but it is not a variety of peach blossom.
It is truly one variety among cherry blossoms, with small flowers.
There is also another variety with the same flowers called "thrice cherry," which blooms three times in one year. This is a type of Fudan-zakura.
○Dōnei says that there is something called "young tree Fudan-zakura" in the flower garden records.

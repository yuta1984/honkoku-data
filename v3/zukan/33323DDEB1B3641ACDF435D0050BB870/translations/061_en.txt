○Ikansei says: It resembles Ko-edo but has double petals and medium-sized flowers. The base of the petals is red and the tips are white. Also, Edo cherry has white bases and red tips. They are distinguished by this difference. There is also a single-petaled variety with light red color, which is called Ariake cherry. There is also something called Ito-kukuri that closely resembles it, but Yang Guifei has slightly more color and shorter stems. It has an intoxicated color. This should indeed be called Sui-kaidou (Drunken Begonia). Ito-kukuri forms balls and droops down with long stems. Also, according to the "Geikuwaen," Yang Guifei is exactly the same as Hi-zakura (Scarlet Cherry), but it has smaller flowers than Hi-zakura with a thousand petals and light crimson color. The flowers attach sparsely. It looks like small chrysanthemums. When in bud it is red, when it opens it is white with a reddish luster. The inner petals do not open but twist and gather in the center. However, it is one name for two varieties.
○The Kasshō-ō Sakura-fu states that it is generally the same as Kiritani.

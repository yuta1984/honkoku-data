The flowers are double-petaled, resembling red plum blossoms, and are very red in color. The leaves, tree, and bark are no different from cherry trees at all. This variety exists at Hidenin in Sennyūji Temple on Higashiyama, but the flowers have not yet bloomed. This is because it is a tree from a warm country that has been transplanted to the cold soil of Kyoto, so the tree does not grow well. It is a different variety from the hi-zakura of the capital.
I went to Hidenin and witnessed this with my own eyes.

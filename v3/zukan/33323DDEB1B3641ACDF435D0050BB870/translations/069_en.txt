Hi-zakura (Scarlet Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Igensei says: Sometimes written as "fire cherry." Both "hi" (scarlet) and "fire" mean red.
It has thousands of petals in small flowers, with long stems that droop downward. When unopened, it is very red in color, but when it opens, the color becomes pale red.
It closely resembles purple chrysanthemums. Also, similar varieties that are white with a slight reddish tinge are called "Yang Guifei" at Geikuhaen garden. These are probably one category with two varieties.

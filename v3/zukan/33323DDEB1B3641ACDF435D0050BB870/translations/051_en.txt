Edo Cherry (Edo-zakura)

○Igan-sai says: It has double petals with long stems and drooping flower clusters. It is exactly like the double-flowered Kirigayatsu, being a variant of Kirigayatsu. The color is deep, and the layering of petals is thinner than Kirigayatsu. Even after the peak blooming period, it does not scatter but withers while clinging to the branches. Overall, among all flowers, this is one of the most luxurious. It blooms late, flowering after Kirigayatsu. What is called "Dai-Edo" (Great Edo) refers to the variety with short stems at Hōrin-ji temple.

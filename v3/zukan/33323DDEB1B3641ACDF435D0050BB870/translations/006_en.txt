begonia. The predecessors who evaluated cherry blossoms all failed to distinguish between these two different plants, and carelessly cited poems by Jing Gong (Wang Anshi) and Jing Lian (Song Lian) as evidence - how negligent and erroneous their research and investigation was! Wang and Song, these two men, did not know the cherry blossoms of our country at all, but merely heard their names through hearsay and casually composed poems about them. How could this be sufficient as evidence? And what their poems refer to as "mountain cherries embracing stones, reflecting among pine branches" - this is actually a different variety of cherry-peach, not sakuranbo at all. Readers who fail to discern this and mistake it for mountain cherry blossoms are in error.

Moreover, using weeping cherry (ito-zakura) to represent weeping begonia is also a biased view. "Weeping" (tareshi) is a general term for sakuranbo and does not refer exclusively to weeping cherry. I have already detailed this in my catalog, so I will not repeat it redundantly now. Cherry blossoms are indeed a wondrous sight under heaven, the foremost among all flowers, and can stand as equals with jade flowers and red osmanthus. From nobles above to commoners below, there is none who does not love and admire them. Therefore, the poetry composed about them throughout history, recorded in compilations like the Man'yōshū and collections like Ryōun-shū and Keikoku-shū, is resplendent

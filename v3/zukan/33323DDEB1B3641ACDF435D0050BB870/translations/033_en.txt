One type is what has been called thread cherry (糸桜) since ancient times. The other type is what we call cherry blossoms today. Upon investigation, in the flower and tree section of the "Anchūshū" (Kitchen Collection), under the entry for drooping silk begonia, it states: "emits threads pointing downward, flowers resemble yamabuki flowers." Today's cherry blossoms all have long stems that hang downward. "Emitting threads" does not refer to drooping branches. What is called drooping silk begonia in the "Begonia Manual" and "Engi Kappō"

refers to today's thread cherry.

Double-petaled drooping silk refers to double-flowered cherry blossoms." This aligns with the theory in the "Anchūshū."

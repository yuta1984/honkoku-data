○Igansei says: This cherry blooms at the same time as the Higan cherry. It is also called Shidari-zakura (weeping cherry). In ornamental gardens, there is a method called ground grafting, and the flowers bloom in clusters with a light color. Those that come from beside the tree-lined road in Ikeda, Settsu Province, are white in color. When transplanted to Kyoto and allowed to become old trees, they are the same as the local thread cherries. The flowers are exactly the same as Higan cherry. However, the branches and stems are soft and graceful, like willow branches.

　Come again tomorrow - the weeping cherry's branches are so slender
　　They have become tied to willow threads

Long ago, when I visited a Chinese monk from Ōbaku, he called it "weeping begonia" (垂枝海棠). Upon investigation, the name "weeping begonia" appears in begonia catalogs, and the Luoyang Flower and Tree Record mentions "drooping silk begonia" (垂絲海棠), also known as "soft branch" (輭條). This matches the characteristics of today's thread cherry.

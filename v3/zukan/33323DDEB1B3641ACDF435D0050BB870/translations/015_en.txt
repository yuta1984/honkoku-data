"Mountain cherry blossoms bloom before spring arrives. Red stamens fill the frost-covered branches. In this secluded place, who will see them? Their fragrant hearts know themselves in vain. They seem to divide the morning sun's light, and appear to fear the evening wind's blowing. I wish to ask about their colorful intentions, but fear I might startle frivolous people."
This appears in the Twelve Poetry Selections. In Song poet Wang Anshi's poem on mountain cherry blossoms:
"Mountain cherry embraces stone and shades pine branches. Compared with other flowers, it blooms latest of all. Fortunately, the spring wind dislikes loneliness, blowing fragrance across water to let people know."
This is found in Volume 28 of the Jiefu Collection.
Thus, there were indeed people in China who loved cherry blossoms. When reciting these poems, our country's cherry blossoms are just like this. Some say that China's yingtao (cherry) is not the same as our sakura, but this is not so.

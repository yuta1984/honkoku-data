has a light pink color. Although this is used to distinguish it, it also tends to be confused with Hotate-zakura because one of the six petals is sometimes deformed and appears like a raised sail. However, Hotate-zakura is white in color. Sakate-zakura has slightly more reddish color than Hotate-zakura. Shibayama, Hotate, and Sakate cherries differ only slightly from each other, distinguished merely by color. Because one of the six petals is twisted, this variety is commonly called "sakate" (reverse-hand).

○Igansai says: Hotate cherry is the same species as Shibayama cherry and has six petals. It is named this way because one petal among them appears like a raised sail. It is easily confused with Sakate cherry. Sakate cherry has a slightly pinkish color, while Hotate cherry is the same as Shibayama cherry with white color. However, it is a different species from Hokake cherry.

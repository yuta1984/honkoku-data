Both varieties are variations of Kiritani. This Rōma originally came from the Sentō Imperial Palace. Namely, there was an imperial decree from Emperor Go-Mizunoo to plant Kiritani seeds in the space beneath the palace corridors, hence it was named Rōma (corridor space). Now there are many in the gardens of Shōgo-in, Shōren-in, and the court nobles' residences. Those seeds have been planted and propagated, spreading even to the homes of samurai and commoners, and now exist in various places.

Also, in Lord Shimizutani's garden there is one plant of Rōma grown from seed, which I have observed. It has single flowers and the flower form resembles crabapple (kaidō). This is a variation of Rōma, not a separate species.

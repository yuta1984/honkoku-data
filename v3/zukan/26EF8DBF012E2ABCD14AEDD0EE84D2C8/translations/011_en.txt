I (Baien) say:
　All plums love spring and bloom accordingly, but winter plums love winter and bloom then. This is
　natural blooming according to the seasons. However, recently plum blossoms have been appreciated from winter months
　and are much used in flower arrangements. These are purchased from flower shops, and all are placed in earth chambers
　and warmed to make them bloom. As the saying goes, plant sellers do likewise,
　making all spring flowers bloom from winter. This is done through human artifice, creating
　spring conditions in heated chambers to force plants and stealing the tree's natural inclination, making each bloom
　early. This goes against the natural season, and since it relies on artificial spring conditions, it should not
　be called winter blooming. Only what blooms naturally in its proper season is a true flower.
　Therefore, wild-growing specimens represent the truth. There is separately something called cold red plum, which is of the same
　tree but with red-colored flowers.

　In China too, it was transmitted from Ryukyu in recent times. What is recorded in Chuogeng Lu existed from the Han and Tang dynasties
　and is found in Chengdu Prefecture. Wang Shimao's Flower Records states: "There is iron cycad in Fuzhou and
　phoenix-tail cycad in Ganzhou. They resemble the same species but differ slightly in form. However, they prefer iron as fertilizer, and when about to wither,
　if nails are driven into their roots, they revive. They are also extraordinary plants" and says they can ward off fire well. Wuzazu states: "Ban-shō resembles phoenix-
　tail cycad but is smaller. It is traditionally said to come from Ryukyu." It also came to Tang China in recent times, so it was
　recorded in materia medica. However, recent Chinese books record this. Since this tree fears cold,
　in Japan it does not exist in northern lands or Kyoto. The phoenix-tail cycad at Myōkoku-ji temple in Senshu province
　has just one root divided into eight trunks, with a height of over one jō. The one at Zuiun-ji temple in the same location is the
　largest, with a height of over one jō and two shaku, having several trunks from one root.

Baien says:
　Phoenix-tail cycad comes abundantly from Satsuma province, with dense leaves, and those trees are the best.
　Ban-shō refers to Ryukyu sago palm. In Japan too, they are abundant in the mountains of Izu and Suruga province,
　and large specimens are often found. They also exist in Kii province. Since they fear cold, in warm countries
　there are large specimens. Their flowers, as shown in the illustration, grow within the overlapping leaves. They all
　protrude and bloom at the top. They are unusual flowers. Their body has fragrant skin like an apricot, and inside
　the fruit there is another skin, with the interior soft like an apricot kernel. They serve well as food, and during famine,
　eating one fruit sustains one for a day. Therefore, when they fruit abundantly, they are gathered and stored as
　military provisions. This flower was obtained from Mr. Ōbu of the Doi clan domain, Suruga province go-kaban, at that time
　on the 22nd day of the 11th month, and truly sketched.

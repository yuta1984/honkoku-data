　　Begonia (Haitang)
　　In Jia Dan's Hundred Flowers Manual of Tang,
　　it is called the immortal among flowers

According to Shen Li's Manual of Begonias, only
those of purple brocade color are called
begonia, the rest are merely棠pear flowers

Ju says:
What the world calls begonia flowers are round ones, with pale red flowers resembling crab apples, these are called begonia. Those with large buds and flowers of varying shades of red, with long drooping red parts, are called weeping begonia and are considered the finest begonias. There is one type called female begonia, commonly called small crab apple. Its flowers are pale reddish-white and it bears abundant fruit. There is also a type called Western Prefecture begonia. Recently imported begonias generally do not bear fruit.

According to Honzō Ikkaigen:
　Alder　Also called ki　Kaede (maple)　Autumn leaves
　　　According to Tashiki:
　Cockscomb tree　Japanese name　Kaite

There are several types of alder and maple trees.
Chinese maple is a different species, with
leaves all different. Maple trees are
rare in Japan, with large trees at Mount Nikkō.
There are large trees in Edo's tree nursery
Gunpōen, but I have not seen them elsewhere.

　　　　　　　　According to Wakan Sansai Zue, Fragrant Woods section:
　　　　　　　　Cockscomb tree (Kaede)　Cockscomb tree　Man'yō　Toad hand (Kaede) tree
　　　　　　Chinese pronunciation　　Japanese name　Kabaite no ki or　Kahirute no ki

　　Ki tree (Kaede)　In Japan, the character for maple is mistakenly read as "kaede"
　　　　　　　　　In Jun Wamyō, cockscomb tree is read
　　Cockscomb tree　　as "kaede." Also called "kaerude." Its leaves
　　　　　　　　　resemble a frog's hands

　　　　According to Wamyō Ruijushō:
　　　　　　Cockscomb tree　According to Yōshi Kango Shō, cockscomb tree　Kabaite no ki
　　　　　　<<glossed: Kaede no ki>>　According to Benshoku Ryūsei, cockscomb tree Kahirute no ki
　　　　　　　　　　Upon consideration, this is now the name of one tree

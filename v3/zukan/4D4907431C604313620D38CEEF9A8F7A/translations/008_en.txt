According to Honzō Ikka (A School of Materia Medica):
Equisetum (sugina/horsetail) has eleven names: gyūshin, danzoku, sōsisō, danchōsō,
shūfusō, shimosō, ryōsamon, ansokusō
Spring of Kanoto-Mi year: The various terms suika, hitchōsai, sui (no) are said to be errors
In my opinion:
The leaves are called sugina, the flowers are called tsukushi
Tenkasai: Maō (ephedra) is male, sugina is female, and so forth
Tsukushi (horsetail shoots)

Yamato Honzō Appendix:
Grows in mountainous areas and wild fields. In spring, it first produces flowers resembling brushes
Separately produces stems and leaves, named sugina. Resembles cedar. The Chinese name is
still unclear in detail. Not yet seen in Chinese texts. Perhaps
it is said that in the appendix to mokuzoku (scouring rush) in Bencao Gangmu there is monkei,
also called setsuzokusō, which might be tsukushi, and so forth

According to Wakan Sansai Zue, Poisonous Plants section:
Hirado azalea
Ryūkyū azalea
Hirado is the name of a place in Kyūshū
Originally came from Ryūkyū, hence the name
The white-flowered ones are called Ryūkyū, the purple-
flowered ones are called tsutsuji

According to Wakan Sansai Zue, Poisonous Plants section:
Eizankō (mountain red)
Red azalea
Commonly called kirishi
no mi
Bencao Gangmu's mountain azalea (mountain pomegranate, rhododendron)
Eizankō and red azalea are considered one thing
Now they are treated as two separate things

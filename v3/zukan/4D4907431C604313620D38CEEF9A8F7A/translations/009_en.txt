Japanese name is hōkai
According to Wamyō Ruijūshō:
Mokka - Erya commentary says mokka has another name bō, pronounced ei
Wamyō Honzō says mokka is mōkai
Its fruit is like a small melon

Yamato Honzō:
Kōkitsu - also called shūkitsu
Japanese name is karatachi
In Chikushi it's called gezu
Since ancient times, people have mistakenly
used this as kikaku and kijitsu
for medicine, which is incorrect
Sansai Zue says that in our country
when mikan is planted in Ōshū it
transforms into kikaku, which is different
Yamato Honzō's kōkitsu karatachi, karatachi being kikaku
matches the explanation in Sansai Zue
Some people say this should be studied

Tobi flower
Also yamabuki
Also called biryō or mifukaki in Man'yōshū
In Rōeishū, writing "winter flower" to refer to yamabuki is an error
Winter refers to fukinotō - called chijin

According to Yamato Honzō:
Teikō - Chinese name is kinwan, kishui
Reading biryō as yamabuki is incorrect
It is tobihagoyaoki

According to Saijō Bunkenroku:
Snow lotus

Recorded in Wakan Sansai Zue, section on Five Fragrant Fruits:
Plum, pronunciation: bai, ancient Japanese name: ume
Branch - now called mume
According to Sansai Zue, plum has four virtues: it values rarity over abundance, values tenderness over robustness, values thinness over fatness, values buds over open blossoms

○ According to Helin Gyokuro, in ancient times people valued fruit over flowers and never praised the beauty or fragrance of flowers, but from the Song dynasty onward, they began to compose poetry about them
○ In our country, in ancient times "flower" meant plum. Since the medieval period, "flower" alone refers to cherry blossoms
○ According to Shoku Nihongi, in the 10th year of Tenpyō, 7th month, Emperor Shōmu pointed to a plum tree in front of the palace and said: "Since last spring I have wanted to appreciate this tree, but have not yet had the chance to admire it. Have thirty literati each compose poems about the plum tree." All composed poems filled with spring sentiment.

"The darkness of a spring night is mysterious - plum blossoms,
though their color cannot be seen, how can their fragrance be hidden?"

According to Yamato Honzō, recorded in the Plum Manual:
Those growing wild that have not yet undergone cultivation or grafting are called
Kōbai (river plum)
Also named Chokkyaku-bai (straight-trunk plum)
Or these are called wild plum

Baekje Wang-in called the plum "this flower." Minister Sugawara no Michizane always loved plums and left behind the name "Flying Plum." From the Jin dynasty Record of Daily Activities comes the designation "tree that loves literature," from Tachibana no Naomoto's poem comes the title "Nightingale Lodge Plum," and from Saigyō's poem "Future Vow Plum." Such examples cannot all be enumerated.

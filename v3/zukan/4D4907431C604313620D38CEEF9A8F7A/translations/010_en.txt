Yamato Honzō:
Pine - Both Japan and China cherish and admire it. Under thousand-year pines there is poria fungus
Similarly above there is dodder seed, and in the roots there is amber. All are good medicines
Pine resin is refined and used to coat bowstrings. It has many other uses including in plasters

Yamato Honzō treats purple flower ground clove, jinjiancai, and violet as three separate species. However, regarding purple flower ground clove
The three types with grass names are all one species. Violet vegetable is a different thing. The name early celery violet is recorded in various books, which is incredibly suspicious

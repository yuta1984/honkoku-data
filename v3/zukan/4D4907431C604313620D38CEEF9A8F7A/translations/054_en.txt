Tennansō (Jack-in-the-pulpit)　Alternative names　Koshō (Tiger palm)　Kokō　Kikonnyaku (Demon konjac)
　　　　Japanese name　Ōsohi
〇Yama-konnyaku (Mountain konjac)

　　　　The Honzō calls it koshō, and the small ones are called yubatsu.
　　　　Its form resembles konjac. It grows in spring from perennial roots.
　　　　Similar to nansei, the stem produces three leaves on two stems.
　　　　The leaves resemble those of pinellia but are larger. The flower resembles nansei but is different
　　　　　　　　Like a stirrup, so the Japanese name is Musashi-abumi
　　　　　　　　(Musashi stirrup). In autumn it becomes vermillion-colored, etc.
　　　　　　　　This is different. This plant has one flower
　　　　　　　　per stem and produces leaves like a palm. It closely
　　　　　　　　resembles konjac. It is called nansei.

　　　　　　　　　Yamato Honzō says:
　　　　　　　　　　　Shizhen says the small ones called yubatsu are one variety.
　　　　　　　　　　　Now examining, there are things in the mountains that resemble nansei but are small.
　　　　　　　　　　　These should be yubatsu, etc.
　　　　　　　　　　　It is clear they are not a variety of nansei.
　　　　　　　　　　〇In Honzō Kōmoku, tennansō blooms in May resembling a snake's
　　　　　　　　　　　head and is yellow. The rest of the fruit and roots are all the same.
　　　　　　　　　　　Tennansō is the koshō of the original classic 《Small ones are named yubatsu》
　　　　　　　　　　　Ancient prescriptions often used koshō because the leaf shape resembles it,
　　　　　　　　　　　not the root. Nansei has round white roots shaped like
　　　　　　　　　　　the old man star, hence named nansei.
　　　　　　　　　　〇Genjū humbly says: What common people call tennansō is mountain kon-
　　　　　　　　　　　nyaku. Nansei does not produce a tail from the flower center but produces round beads
　　　　　　　　　　　about the size of a little finger. The leaf stems are opposite and
　　　　　　　　　　　flowers emerge from the fork. Mountain konjac has one stem, one flower, and is a different thing.

According to Wakan Sansai Zue's commentary, koshō is the original name. Wamyōshō also has
koshō but not tennansō. Now conversely there is no koshō, and scholars doubt this because it is a different variety
emerging from koshō seeds that is named tennansō 《one plant, different varieties, different names》. Recently also
producing different varieties 《kankisō, Musashi-abumi》 of this type. Since koshō and tennansō are similar,
each is a separate species. Also nansei has two types: those with shallow blue flower clusters like a mouse tail
are no more than one foot tall, merely like a spoon and Buddha's halo. Those without mouse tails are about two feet
tall, naturally one group of two species. Sansai Zue and Honzō Hitsudoku present
　　　　　　　　　　two diagrams of koshō and tennansō, making it clear they are
　　　　　　　　　　two different things.

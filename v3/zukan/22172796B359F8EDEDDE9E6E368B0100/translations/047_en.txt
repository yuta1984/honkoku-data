Excerpt from Chikinsho (Brocade of Earth)
　　Seiōbo Peach (Queen Mother of the West Peach)

Various materia medica texts record that the Seiōbo peach, also called winter peach or Kunlun peach, has single flowers and fruit that ripens in the ninth and tenth months. What is now called Seiōbo in Japan has double petals and large blooms. The tree resembles the Genpei peach and some bear fruit. Its flowering pattern is like the one-year peach. While the one-year peach has single flowers, the Seiōbo has no leaves until the flowers fall. During the seventh and eighth months, many flowers bloom at the leaf tips, but these are not return blooms - this occurs the same way every year. This is as explained in the Chikinsho. The life drawing will also appear in Volume 5 of the Autumn section.

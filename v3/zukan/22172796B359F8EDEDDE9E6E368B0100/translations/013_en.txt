Stone Sweet Flag (Sekishōbu)　Japanese name: Sekishi　〇Rock Iris
　　　　　(Rock Iris)　Yau
　　　　　Alternative names: Shōyō, Gyōkyū, Water Sword Grass


　　　　　When you place one pot of stone sweet flag on a desk and
　　　　　observe it at night, it does not harm the eyes when reading books.
　　　　　Baien says: "Sweet flag is pronounced 'sekishi,'
　　　　　and what is called 'rock iris' is a different species.
　　　　　What some people say about hanging this along with iris (ayame) 
　　　　　under the eaves of houses during the Boys' Festival is incorrect.
　　　　　That is water sweet flag, which is not used medicinally.
　　　　　It is also called mud sweet flag."

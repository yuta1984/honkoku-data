From "Nōsei Zensho" (Complete Book of Agricultural Administration):
Etsurancai (Atsurancai) - gunbai-natsuna, commonly called "aransai" in Edo

The pods of its fruit are large, and their shape resembles a military fan (gunbai), hence the name.
It does not grow in other places within Edo, but grows around Shinagawa and Kawasaki.

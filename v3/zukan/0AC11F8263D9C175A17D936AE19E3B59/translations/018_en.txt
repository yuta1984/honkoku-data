Enokitake (Enoki mushroom)

　An illustration found in Kankatsu. Kinshi (Mushroom Records) states: "They grow on
　old roots and rotted stumps of enoki trees.
　They resemble ume-take with long stems and white undersides with deep indigo color.
　Both cap and stem are all dark brown, and there are also
　yellow-brown varieties. They grow in scales reaching several hundred stems. From autumn
　through the border of winter and spring they continue to grow.
　They are tender and smooth with beautiful fragrance, and those that grow late are most excellent. They are dried and
　stored, then soaked in water and boiled for eating. They also have
　elegant flavor. There are even larger, ash-white varieties called
　hira-take." Currently, most of those sold in markets are grown by
　placing rotted stumps and roots in earth cellars, pouring rice liquid
　over them, and covering with straw.
　Therefore, the taste naturally is inferior to wild ones, it is said.

　This is an illustration found in Shin'yō Kinpu (Shinano Mushroom Records).
　The same book states that it is "delicately flavored
　and of superior quality." Kōwa Kinpu states: "During the cold congealing period
　of this time, mushroom flowers grow on
　mulberry tree stumps. They closely resemble kashin
　and have an extremely sweet taste."
　Goshinfu (Wu Mushroom Records) states: "Mulberry mushrooms are purple in color,
　and there are also yellow ones. Their shape is like
　fragrant mushrooms" (omitted) "People say that eating them brightens the eyes."

　Grain tree mushroom 《Wu Mushroom Records》

　An illustration found in Kinshi (Mushroom Records). The same book states: "They grow most abundantly on
　paper mulberry trees during summer and autumn, resembling shiitake
　but with a thinner quality, spreading umbrella-like to over one sun in size. The cap and
　stem are chestnut-shell colored, with the underside a deep indigo color like egg color, and there are also
　yellow-brown and white-brown varieties. They are tender and deliciously fresh.
　After drying once under intense sunlight, they are eaten. They are most excellent, and though found
　throughout various provinces, none surpass the
　beauty of those produced in Yamato Province." Shin'yō Kinpu states:
　"Paper mulberry mushrooms are delicately flavored and of superior quality, no different
　from mulberry mushrooms. They grow in early winter."

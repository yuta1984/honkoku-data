Bakushin (Wheat Mushroom) 《Jikai》　Seuro　Shōro (Pine Dew) 《Denshin-roku》　Chijin 《Guangdong Xinyu》

According to the Yamato Honzō, it grows in white sand within pine forests. It appears between winter and spring, after rain. It has a pine fragrance and tastes delicious, with a light nature. It is non-toxic, and even sick people can eat it without harm. However, being a raw organism, it should not be eaten during diarrhea. The dried form is harmless. Its shape is round, and large ones resemble plums, having neither cap nor stem. There are three varieties: yellow and white. Those with pure white, soft interior are considered top grade. They are commonly called "mochi-shōro" (rice cake pine dew). The next grade is bland and brittle. The next is yellowish-black, which is inferior grade. After one day it loses flavor, so fresh ones are preferred. Over time it spoils easily and becomes inedible. Take white, fresh, large ones, wash to remove sand, and eat either boiled or grilled. Also cut into slices with sand, dry in the sun, and send to distant places - the taste is good. Preserving in salt is also good. Those growing in mountains are poisonous and inedible. In recent years, people select aged shōro, cut them finely, make furrows in fields, sow them and cover with soil - they will grow even in soil where they don't naturally occur. This is called "cultivated shōro."

Illustration from Kanko. According to Kinshi (Mushroom History), they grow in sandy soil under pines near the seashore. They are most abundant from late spring to summer. They have no stem or cap, shaped like bullets, sometimes bearing sandy soil on top, sometimes exposed above ground. They come in several colors: yellow-white, pale purple, yellow-brown, purple-black, and there are also pure white ones, which are the best. Young ones have slightly sticky sap. When aged they become dry, with a mild sweet taste and slight pine fragrance.

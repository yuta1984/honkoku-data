Shishitake, Shikatake 《From "Honchō Shokkan"》

This is a stored illustration by Mr. Kusumoto. In "Kinshi," there is a variety that is black in color with a long stem shaped like a cockscomb flower. People of Kaga call this "hōshu" (precious jewel). Currently, sellers in the market have very many of this type. It is said that all come from places that produce them in Ōshū. According to "Yamato Honzō," it is called kawatake or shikatake. It grows in autumn fields. The stem is long and large. When fresh, the color is reddish-black, and after drying it becomes black. It can be eaten. Some say it should not be eaten raw as it is poisonous, and should be dried before eating.

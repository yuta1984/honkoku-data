Wood Ear (Mokuji)　Kikurage (Wood Jellyfish)

　This entry grows on various trees, and because its shape is like an ear and also like a jellyfish (kurage), it has the names wood ear and wood jellyfish. In the Jikai it states: "Wood ear grows on all kinds of trees. Its beneficial or toxic properties also follow the nature of the wood. Since this is not clear, one must not fail to examine it carefully. Today, those who sell it also often use those growing on miscellaneous trees." In our country too, there are poisonous varieties depending on the nature of the wood, so one should choose carefully. Those with stems that produce caps in umbrella shapes are fungi or mushrooms (shin). These should not be included in this category.

Mulberry Ear (Sōji)　Kuwa no mimi 《Hachijō dialect》　Kuwa no kikurage　Mulberry Goose (Sōga) 《From Jibutsu Genchu》

　This is kikurage that grows on decayed parts of mulberry trees. The three names from Shakumei - Sōō (mulberry yellow), Sōshin (mulberry retainer), and Sōjō kisei (mulberry parasitic plant) - refer to the same thing, which is bracket fungi (sarunokoshikake). In medicinal prescriptions it's called Sōō, and in the Kosho-rui Honzō it's called Mokubaku. In Hizen it's called meshimakobu. Much of it comes from Hachijō Island. It is wrong for medicine shops to sell this under the name Sōkisei (mulberry parasitic plant). Although one might think the examination is not far off since it grows on mulberry trees, the properties are greatly different. True Sōkisei, though it grows on mulberry trees, is not a fungus.

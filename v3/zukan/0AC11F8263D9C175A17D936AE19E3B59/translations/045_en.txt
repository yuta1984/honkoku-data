Sama-matsutake

"Yamato Honzō" states: "Those that grow in the 5th and 6th months are called sama-matsutake. Their taste is inferior." "Kōwa Kinfu" states: "Grows in the 5th month and is larger than autumn mushrooms. However, its fragrance and taste do not compare. Some say it has slight toxicity. In the Hizen region it is called 'tsuchi-kamuri.'" "Kinshi" also mentions early matsutake: "During the 6th and 7th months, they grow abundantly among pine trees in the mountains. Their form and taste are exactly like matsutake. They also develop by borrowing the essence of pine, but they are poisonous and harm people. One should carefully examine suspicious ones. Similar-looking ones should be avoided and not eaten."

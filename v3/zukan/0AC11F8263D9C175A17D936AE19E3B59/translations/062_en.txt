Ki shimeji (Yellow shimeji)

An illustration from the Kanko. According to the Kinshi (Mushroom History), the cap is about the size of a coin, with a yellowish-black surface, and both the cap and stem are deep yellow in color. Initially, it emerges from the ground as a single pointed tip, and after some time the cap opens. The stem is thick and solid inside, becoming most vigorous after receiving frost. Among mushrooms, this is a late-growing variety that grows in the northern mountains and various mountains of Ise. It is tough yet smooth, fresh and delicious. This does not exist in the Kantō region. Occasionally, people from Ise preserve them in salt and send them to Edo, where they are rarely sold in the Edo markets.

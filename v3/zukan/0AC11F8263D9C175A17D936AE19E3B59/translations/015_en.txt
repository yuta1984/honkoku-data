Cedar mushroom (sankin) - Sukitake

This is an illustration found in the Kinshi (Mushroom Records). The same book states: "The stem is thin and long, the cap is large but does not spread excessively, the top is slightly pointed, both the surface and stem are soy sauce colored, and the pointed parts have a slight black tinge. The gills are yellowish-white, and some have stems that are pale yellow with slightly black lower portions. There are also those whose caps and stems are all yellowish-white or grayish-white. They grow in clusters on the roots of old cedar trees and on rotten stumps in the mountains. They are slippery and delicious, with the scent of cedar. Their aroma and taste are almost similar to ume-take (plum mushrooms)."

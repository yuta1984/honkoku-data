　Illustration from the Mushroom History (Kinshi). According to the same book, the cap is expanded with a short stem, the surface of the stem has a reddish-purple tinge and is pale reddish-brown in color, and over time it changes to yellowish-brown. Since it grows at the beginning of summer ahead of other mushrooms, it is called "hatsu-kin" (first mushroom).

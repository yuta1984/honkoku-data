Shimeji-take (Shimeji mushroom)

Illustration from Kanko. According to the Mushroom History, they grow abundantly in the moist ground under trees in shaded mountains, hence the name. The shape is like that of hatsu-take (Lactarius hatsudake), with a somewhat long stem and a grayish-black surface, though there are also black-brown and yellowish-black varieties. The stems are all pure white, soft and brittle, easily damaged, sweet and smooth with a pleasant aroma. They are found in all provinces, but those from Kyoto are considered the finest. They are cooked like tofu, sometimes with ginger shavings added, or with wasabi. They almost rival hatsu-take mushrooms. Products from other provinces are not discussed here. Salt-preserved and dried varieties also each have their own distinctive flavors that are indescribable.

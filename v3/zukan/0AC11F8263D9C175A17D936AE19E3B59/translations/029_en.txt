　According to Kinshi (Fungal History), they grow in clusters on the roots of old paulownia trees. They are gray in color and taste
　good. However, they are not something that is always available.
　The same book quotes Kishin Zatshiki, stating that in China, paulownia
　mushrooms are pickled in hemp oil and eaten.

Yanagitake

　This is a figure recorded in Kanko. According to Kinshi, the cap spreads out
　like a coin, with a long stem and grows in clusters. Initially
　they are pure white, but after some time they turn yellow.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　

They are tender and fresh,
　　beautiful, and especially suitable
　　　with tofu and Chinese cabbage.
　　　There are also those with black surfaces
　　　　and white [undersides], with very
　　　　large forms.

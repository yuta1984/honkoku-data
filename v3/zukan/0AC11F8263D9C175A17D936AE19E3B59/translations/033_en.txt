Naratake (Honey mushroom)
This is a figure recorded in "Mōkinzu." According to "Kōwa Takefū," naratake grows abundantly on oak trees in Jōshū Mito. Mountain people cut these down and let them fall, and when they are fumigated by mountain air, mushrooms grow. There is no difference from kashitake (shiitake). Local people mix these with kashitake (shiitake), and the taste is also excellent. According to "Nikkō Kinfu," the color is slightly reddish and yellowish. It belongs to the category of moisture-loving varieties and is a distinctive species. It is said to grow frequently after autumn rains.

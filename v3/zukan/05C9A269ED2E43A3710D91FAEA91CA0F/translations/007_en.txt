Yama-tsubaki (Mountain Camellia)
　This is a variety that grows wild
　in the mountains,
　with trees reaching about two jō in height.
　The leaves do not wither throughout the four seasons. The leaf
　shape resembles that of the ka (camellia),
　being round and thick with serrated edges around the perimeter. In the winter months, buds form at the
　tips of branches and flowers bloom. They have five or six petals and are deep crimson in color. When the flowers
　fall, the petals do not scatter separately but drop as a whole. The fruit is about the size of a fingertip and contains three or four
　seeds inside.

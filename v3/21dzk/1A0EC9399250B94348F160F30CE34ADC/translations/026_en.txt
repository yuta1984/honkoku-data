If one says "the dispute is not in the predicate," then at that time one first knows that the words "having separate essence" contain complications 《as in the Lamp commentary》. When examining the implicit meaning of the subject, it becomes the subject's essential characteristic, but ordinarily there is no such example. In the inference of contact having separate essence, the dispute is exhausted in the predicate's words. Even if the adversary examines the subject's implicit meaning, they cannot overcome that fallacy. 《Regarding the contact inference, whether there is dharma essential characteristic inference-contradiction should be separately discussed》

Question: When examining implicit meaning through complications in the predicate, must dharma-distinction contradiction inferences necessarily have complications in explicit statement?
Answer: They must. That is to say, if the dispute lies in explicit statement, one would commit mutual agreement fallacy, etc. 《The inferences "necessarily for others' use," "creating conditional nature of existence," etc. are all of this type》

○The meaning of examining positive and negative examples in inferences establishing dharma and subject
Question: According to Kojima's understanding, where the word "non-substantial" has the meaning of existing separate from substance, being-nature having essence equally with positive examples but not being equal - is this in relation to positive and negative examples because it is the implicit meaning of "non-substantial"?
Answer: That is so.
Question: If so, is being-nature not the subject's implicit meaning?
Answer: It is the subject's implicit meaning. Originally the subject raises great being-nature separate from substance, and upon reaching the predicate makes that meaning known. However, under the predicate, it reveals as meaning that being-nature has essence separate from substance, not as being-nature's essence. The subject is also not being-nature having essence separate from substance as meaning. Though essence and meaning do not separate from each other, the meanings of dharma and subject are somewhat different.

Question: If so, what the predicate properly reveals is only the meaning of having essence. Why then examine and establish negative examples? If it is negative examples because it makes them correspond without abandoning being-nature, is this the force of non-separation meaning? If so, the sound-impermanence inference should also have this fallacy.
Answer: In inferences establishing dharma,

【Lower section】
the dispute remains in the predicate. Therefore, even without abandoning sound, since impermanence meaning is made the true thesis, there are positive examples. In inferences establishing subject, the dispute does not remain in either the predicate or subject's meaning. Therefore there are no positive examples. That is to say, being-nature's having essence separate from substance all becomes dispute. However, when drawing positive examples, it simply shows establishing non-substantial meaning. The true original intention establishes having essence within non-substantial, and from having essence transmits to being-nature.

Question: When the adversary examines fallacies, by what does one know this inference establishes the subject? If the predicate "non-substantial" necessarily has complications, that reasoning is not so. Having established non-substantial regarding being-nature, can it contradict disciples, with dispute exhausted in the predicate?
Answer: Master and disciple do not accept shared teaching. The great being category is already a completely non-mutually accepted dharma-essence. If not contrived establishment but wanting to establish clearly, one must establish self-inference using having-essence as predicate. Yet as shared inference, borrowing the existence of "not non-existent," calling it great being-nature. The predicate also says "non-substantial," not saying "having essence." The inference's verbal force does not exhaust inner illumination's thesis but shows shared inference. Therefore subject and predicate necessarily have complications as criticism. If again regarding this contrived establishment, when seeing that within "non-substantial" is creating conditional nature of existence, it becomes subject-distinction.

Question: When Kojima uses the original method, does he examine two distinctions under the predicate's creating conditional nature of existence meaning? If saying so, how can one examine two distinctions without explicit statement of creating conditional nature of existence? If there are two categories under the distinguished term, creating conditional nature of existence meaning is already in the predicate. It should be the same as the separate method. Why set aside the predicate and examine this under the subject?
Answer: According to the senior's understanding, when using the original method, does one examine this under the subject? Generally, the two categories of subject-distinction are originally under the subject, and when establishing the words of creating

conditional nature of existence, because those terms are clear, implicit meaning naturally also resides at the predicate's location. However, being in the predicate is not the original standard form of the later two contradictions. Therefore, when using the original method, it should necessarily be under the subject.

The implicit meaning of essential characteristic inference: from words it transmits, seeking complications and exploring them. Distinction sees that there are two distinctions.
By making non-intended purpose mutually accepted by self and others, one knows there are things opposing it 《登》. Non-intended purpose is explicit statement.
This is the part the adversary also knows. If limited to this part, there should be mutual agreement. Therefore one decisively knows there should also be deep intended purpose.

Around the 7th month of Ken'ei 2 [1207], at the grass hermitage of the Zen master from Tanshū at Shin-Yakushiji in the Southern Capital, facing two or three fellow practitioners, while respectfully discussing Kojima's two-volume private record, I obtained this plan.

○The disputed thesis in consciousness-only inference
Question: What does the consciousness-only inference make its intended thesis?
Answer: According to the Great Commentary etc., it makes "form under the subject not definitely separate from eye-consciousness" the intended meaning.
Question: This inference is to refute outsiders having real objects separate from mind. The subject raises form and establishes "not separate from eye-consciousness." The words "not separate" block separate essence. Why additionally establish the existence of form's essence? Among the two gates of separate and not-separate, "separate" shows having separate essence through mutual relation. The words "not separate" reverse this. It is already the gate of mutual dependence. How does it accord with their implicit meaning?

【Lower section】
Here one knows: this inference does not dispute form's essence. Because it is established form perceived by eye. Regarding that form, establishing the meaning of not being separate from the cognizing mind, it refutes outsiders' real objects separate from consciousness.
Answer: "Form not definitely separate from eye-consciousness" is form within mind. Because the four divisions are distinct, it is not identical. Because it is the same one mind, it is not separate. Non-identical and non-separate - this is the middle way principle. It equally blocks both elaboration and deprecation. If exclusively establishing form's essence, why say "not separate from eye-consciousness"? If one-sidedly refuting form's essence, why carry the subject's explicit statement and establish it? One should know: this intended meaning is not the same as inferences that generally establish essence. Nor does it one-sidedly refute form's essence.

To elaborate: outsiders think form faces mind and grasp that there is separate essence external to mind. The Mahāyāna consciousness-only school blocks their elaborative grasping. Outsiders, hearing this, also mistakenly think the Mahāyāna school holds there is only one mind, nothing external to mind, what eye-consciousness cognizes is identical to eye-consciousness essence, being neither form nor object. This inference refutes both extreme graspings. Therefore the subject's implicit meaning becomes "form not definitely separate from eye-consciousness." Because it is form, it does not lack essence. Because it is not separate, it does not have separate essence. The predicate's explicit statement says "not separate from eye-consciousness." Though it refutes separation, it does not completely eliminate the form-sphere. The words "not separate" originally have the meaning of not abandoning the two gates.

However, if like the doubt and difficulty, does it one-sidedly dispute the predicate? If so, why did the Tripiṭaka Master, fearing subject-distinction, place the qualifier "according to our own position" in advance on the reason? The commentary master's explanation raises what people know. Moreover, outsiders grasp objects as real. Their grasped real objects are non-existent dharmas of imagination that appear to consciousness - imagined nature. They do not yet know the other-dependent aspect-part appearing in mind. When Mahāyāna refutes this, why not include the three gates? Though form perceived by eye is established, among that form's fundamental object, reflected images, etc., there are also varieties

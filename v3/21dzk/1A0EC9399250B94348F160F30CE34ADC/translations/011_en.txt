○ The Matter of the Willing-to-Establish Thesis in the Existence-Nature Non-Reality Syllogism Being in Mental Acceptance
Question: The present syllogism desires to establish the meaning that existence-nature has substance separate from reality etc. It raises existence-nature as the qualified-subject and establishes non-reality as the predicand. Looking at that inseparability-nature thesis, it establishes separate-from-reality great-existence and refutes immediate-reality existence-nature. The establisher's willing-to-establish is already manifest in verbal expression. Why make it a deceptive establishment syllogism? Answer: The teacher-master establishes the six categories. The six existence-categories are precisely one of those dharma-substances. The disciple, using that which-has, does not permit separate substance existing immediately in reality etc. substances. The sage desires to establish existence-nature's substance and establishes the present syllogism. If manifestly establishing this substance, [one] should establish "my existence-nature" as qualified-subject and use "separately having substance" as predicand. However, the qualified-subject has no distinctions, raises commonly accepted existence-nature, establishes non-reality as predicand, and does not manifestly establish the meaning of having substance. It should be known that the qualified-subject has mental acceptance. This is so-called separate-from-reality great-existence-nature. The predicand has front and

back. The verbal back deceptively establishes the meaning of separate-from-reality having-substance. Generally, opponents use the verbal branches of established syllogisms to counter disputes in the inner-illumination gate. If that meaning is not exhausted, [they] know the establisher's deceptive establishment, examine mental acceptance, and explore willing-to-establish.

○ The Matter of Not Establishing Separate-from-Reality Having-Substance Predicands
Question: In the practice of establishing syllogisms, verbal expression desires to exhaust one's own willing-to-establish. Meanings reached by same-example power must be established and manifested in predicands. Meanings equal to same-examples are not non-extremely-established, therefore. If same-examples do not reach, [they are] set aside and not established. Since sameness-difference-nature already possesses the meaning of separate-from-reality having-substance, if predicands were established thus, the establishment would be satisfactory. Why use non-reality words and not establish having-substance thesis? Answer: If establishing having-substance predicands, would the sage's original intention be exhausted or not? If establishing exhausts [it], since separate-from-reality great-existence name-substance is not yet manifest, how could the comparative syllogism's willing-to-establish achieve completion? If even establishing having-substance, if disputes are not yet exhausted, it is not like deceptive establishment. Question: Using existence-nonexistence predicands to accomplish qualified-subject substance is one form of comparative syllogism. Establishing thus in qualified-subjects is precisely this. If the sage establishes having-substance predicands and establishes existence-nature substance, how would the thesis-meaning not be satisfactory? Answer: Though comparative syllogisms have self-other-shared [types], shared-comparison is fundamental. When the sage establishes shared-comparison to accomplish great-existence-nature substance, if it were not deceptive establishment, [it] would necessarily commit faults. The qualified-subject carries mental acceptance, the predicand places deceptive words. Question: Mahāyāna's established no-nature comparative syllogism, contact-separate having-substance syllogism etc. raise substance in qualified-subjects, establish having-substance in predicands, [yet] have no faults at all. Answer: Those establisher-opponent

two parties are both Buddha-disciples. The qualified-subject directly raises dharma-substance explained by shared teachings, therefore there is no non-extreme-establishment at all. It is not like before disciples have not yet followed the sage, not permitting great-existence substance. The repeated meaning is: raising shared teaching explanations, because opponents permit that substance. Though predicands dispute substance existence-nonexistence, this is still the category of disputing meanings. (Still should question and answer. As in separate volume records. [Note: Kan'ō edition lacks this annotation]) Question: In consciousness-only comparative syllogisms, among opponents are non-Buddhists. How is qualified-subject form-substance extremely-established? Answer: That raises form traveled by eyes. This is dharma-substance commonly accepted by inner and outer [schools]. It is not like teacher-disciple disputes. Moreover, that syllogism is deceptive establishment procedure. It cannot constitute a difficulty. (This matter may have separate meanings [Note: One edition lacks annotation])

○ The Matter of Using Sameness-Difference-Nature to Consider Different Examples Regarding Existence-Nature Substance
Question: Syllogisms that raise substance in qualified-subjects and establish existence-nonexistence words in predicands, should they also be thus? Answer: That is a syllogism using dharma to accomplish dharma. It is not the same as existence-nature syllogisms. Question: Using separate having-substance predicands, already establishing qualified-subject substance, how is it like sound-impermanence syllogisms that only accomplish dharma? Answer: Syllogisms using existence-nonexistence predicands to accomplish qualified-subject substance are mostly self-comparative syllogisms. The qualified-subject directly raises non-extremely-established dharma-substance, completely without mental acceptance. The predicand states separate having-substance, not deceptive establishment, therefore disputes remain in predicands. Not the same as existence-nature syllogisms. Question: In syllogisms raising substance in qualified-subjects and establishing existence-nonexistence in predicands, there is the meaning of accomplishing that dharma only through dharma, but is there no meaning of thus establishing in qualified-subjects? Answer: There can be two gates. The Treatise on Logical Reasoning exclusively clarifies correct comparative syllogism characteristics. When correct comparative syllogisms accomplish substance, mostly using existence-nonexistence predicands, they draw opponent's evidential cognition. Where cause-example power reaches is only dharma, not qualified-

subjects. However, when predicand-thesis establishment is completed, qualified-subject substance accomplishes itself. Therefore it is not without the meaning of thus establishing in qualified-subjects. Discussing from the gate of establishing syllogisms, [they] only accomplish dharma. Syllogisms deceptively accomplishing qualified-subjects differ from this. Because initially [they] desire to include substance. If that meaning is not established, [they] immediately commit the latter two contradictions.

○ The Matter of Established-Dharma
The Brief Compilation has two explanations. (Bright Lamp Commentary is the same) Among them, maintaining the explanation of "established-dharma" is because it accords with the Commentary's meaning of "dharma in total thesis." Question: Is "established-dharma" extremely-established predicand or total-thesis predicand? Answer: There are two meanings. First: it is extremely-established predicand. Second: it is total-thesis predicand. Question: Which is taken as correct? Answer: The total-thesis predicand meaning accords with the Commentary explanation. "Dharma in total thesis" distinguishes extremely-established predicands. Also, "similar substance-categories" means impermanence not separate from sound. With general impermanence, here and there are one thing - what could be called "similar"? (Detailed as in Clear Text) Or the explanation of established-being-dharma is not without that reasoning. Generally, "established" is local-universal corresponding to what-is-accomplished. Whether establishing dharma or qualified-subjects, what establishers gladly desire to establish all obtain the name "established." That established necessarily becomes dharma to accomplish it. Therefore it is called "established-dharma." "Established means thesis, dharma means predicand" - this is the meaning. Question: If so, why say "dharma in total thesis"? Answer: Opposing particular thesis, using total thesis to say "in." The meaning is: among two gates, now taking this gate to say "in." It is not that total thesis further has two parts. If maintaining this explanation, then established-

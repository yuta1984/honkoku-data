Doctrines also mutually contradict causes. They can be called "contradictory doctrines." Therefore, analogical difficulties cannot be escaped. That "capable of contradicting" is precisely the meaning of cause is what this cause-theorist acknowledges peripherally. How does this come to be analogous to Master Gui?

　　The fault of not considering one's own errors (If causes originally do not contradict doctrines by themselves, why bother seeking analogical difficulties? If one acknowledges that causes contradict doctrines but doctrines do not contradict causes, this conversely invites analogical difficulties. If one acknowledges mutual contradiction, why are doctrines not called "contradictory"?)

This difficulty has already been resolved. Master Gui's doctrine-cause mutual reversal should have the same meaning, hence causing analogical difficulties. Since one takes "capable of contradicting" as the meaning of cause-contradiction, there is no analogical difficulty that doctrines can be called "capable of contradicting."

　The main point of contradictory cause doctrine
Causes have fourteen faults, divided into three categories. Among these, the four "non-establishments" involve doctrine and cause being separated, and although they lose the function of proof, they still do not reach the point of establishing other doctrines. The six "indeterminates" are hesitating causes that combine both concordant and contradictory meanings. As for contradictory causes, they not only fail to establish one's own doctrine but additionally can establish other doctrines. Their faults are extremely grave, with no comparison. That general's house has four types of companions. First: those who can assist the master and harm the enemy. Second: those who have no merit toward the master but do not belong to others. Third: those who belong to both master and enemy. Fourth: those who belong to the enemy and harm the master. Correct causes are like the first; non-establishment and indeterminacy are like the next, resembling his second and third types. Contradictory causes are the same as the fourth type. The correctness, error, lightness, and gravity can be known by following the types. The names of non-establishment and indeterminacy all express themselves. How could the terminology of contradictory causes take one and lose one? Among these, establishing contradictory doctrines lifts the heavy while including the light. If one obtains this name due to immediate causation, it shows light faults while hiding heavy losses. The superiority and inferiority of the two meanings can be contemplated through comparison. Also, among the thirty-three faults,

The other faulty characteristics have not yet expressed the names of doctrine-cause-example. Only these four contradictions independently establish the name of cause. How could there be no deep reason? If this cause were a pseudo-cause, pseudo-doctrines and pseudo-examples should also be able to obtain doctrine-example names. Why is this not so? The commentary master well received the correct teaching of the Tripiṭaka master and himself realized the gains and losses of the two meanings. The intent of inclusion and exclusion is clear in the commentary text. What末学 could reach different inferences?

　This doctrine is detailed in the Myōhon-ki. Also, regarding the origin of the questions and answers about "causes overturning doctrines," I have obtained some separate inferences, as in other commentaries.

The Yuishiki-sho Kenrin-shū Volume 16 states (collected by Shusen of Ryūkōji):
The commentary says "Mahāyāna cessation characteristics, etc." Question: Since Mahāyāna cessation does not wait for causes, for whom does the present contradictory cause serve as a cause? Therefore the commentary explains this. Just as frost and the like are contrary to blue and serve as causes for yellow, contradictory causes also have no fault. Because what they aim for differs. ○ Also, when the Lamp makes this like the four contradictions, various masters immediately say the Lamp makes it dependent naming, calling this extremely erroneous. Since the Lamp has already established the commentary's meaning in the preceding and made it qualitative explanation, in the mutual questions and answers, within this answer, it gives examples to explain. How could it need to become dependent naming instead? Now explaining the Lamp text: this is not analogical establishment but makes it dependent naming to oppose different masters, dispute their cause doctrine, and analogically establish this cause. Although called contradictory, its cause doctrine also looks toward concordant effects. Like the four contradictions, the four contradictions also look toward establishing the opponent's doctrine. This is immediate concordant benefit and is for the sake of cause doctrine. Therefore various [scholars] are not yet clear. Question: If so, how in this case

is it called "contradictory cause"? Answer: Contradicting the former and according with the latter, one can also obtain the name. One theory says they mutually standardize each other, each making two explanations, thereby exhausting the principle. Not being good at establishing names, each has separate intent. When the treatise here says "causing non-arising, etc.," the contradictory meaning definitely lies in "capable of contradicting." How could there be the meaning of obtaining names from effects? Also, even if following effects, it would be effect-contradiction - how would this accord with the cause doctrine of concordance and contradiction here? Since this passage correctly clarifies the concordance and contradiction of causes, it is therefore only qualitative naming. If those four contradictions were made qualitative, they would confuse with ancient doctrines, as in that commentary explanation. Also, the various faults of doctrine, cause, and example in Buddhist logic all look toward the faulty aspects and establish their names. Establishing two doctrines simultaneously is called "indeterminate" because it definitely does not establish one school's doctrine. Complete reversal establishment is called "contradictory" because it can definitely contradict and harm one's own established doctrine. If made qualitative, one only sees the meaning of one's own cause contradicting one's own doctrine, not seeing the reversal establishment of others' doctrines. Therefore, establishing names necessarily sees where faults are committed. Hence it is not just creating faults by contradicting one's own doctrine. If so, there would be no difference from ancient doctrines. Therefore know that each of the two places explaining one interpretation is for certainty. They cannot be mutually applied as correct doctrine.

　Now seeing this collection, it describes that Buddhist logic contradictory causes are limited only to dependent naming doctrine, saying "If made qualitative, one only sees the meaning of one's own cause contradicting one's own doctrine, not seeing the reversal establishment of others' doctrines." (Text) This explanation agrees with my long-held understanding. However, regarding the qualitative explanation of esoteric contradictory causes, this has not been thoroughly examined and should be investigated.

　○ Particular-Universal Opposition: Self-nature and Distinguishing Characteristics

【Lower section】
A separate theory states: Regarding particular-universal, there are two approaches. First is the approach of substantial meaning reality. Second is the approach of provisional establishment and expedient appropriateness. The substantial meaning reality approach: as previously established, the substances of form and mind, meanings like emptiness and non-existence serve as particular and universal respectively. This is truly real, naturally inevitable substantial meaning. Provisional establishment and expedient appropriateness means: when establishing arguments, wanting to establish syllogisms to prove whether substance or meaning, when conducting various examinations, if it were like the substantial meaning of dharmas, wanting to sequentially place qualifiers and qualified, there might be faults to commit. Therefore sometimes one makes corrective establishments, like the "necessarily for others' use" syllogism. Or although not correct corrective establishment, placing dharma-substance as qualifier, making expedient appropriateness the meaning. That is, on the subject "mountain location," revealing the meaning of "having fire" to make it apply to kitchens, etc. Such syllogisms raise dharma-substance while making expedient appropriateness the meaning. This too is a syllogism within the particular-universal approach that takes meaning as what is to be established. Taking this as the main point of the two approaches. If one exclusively clings to the latter approach as real meaning, it greatly disturbs the sequence of the three-fold opposition. Because root-branch and broad-narrow do not accord with each other. Also because it violates cited testimonial texts, the meaning of uncertain name-obtaining likely invites much contradiction. This is because one takes expedient appropriateness as definitive measure while additionally making real meaning false. If one exclusively relies on the former approach, although the general idea might be acceptable, there are rough textual violations. Accordingly, syllogisms where substantial meaning and before-after do not accord seem very difficult to reconcile. Therefore adding the latter approach. Do explanations like Gi-dan include the latter approach? However, although including both approaches, the former approach is still considered real. Therefore syllogisms like "mountain location has fire" should be called syllogisms establishing substance. Nevertheless, this does not block the approach of establishing meaning.

Question: Does the latter approach mean that in one complete syllogism, both particular and universal are included together? Answer: Not so. It only discusses

The opposition is the disputed thesis-substance. Otherwise, how could one dispute thesis-basis? Answer: That explains the particular-universal opposition. In particular-universal opposition, the disputed substance-meaning resides in the four theses, explaining and distinguishing their differences.

○ Does the contradicting thesis have implicit intention?
If it exists, the Meaning-Decision states: "These are what the four contradictory causes contradict." (Text) If it doesn't exist, how could the contradicting statement "existence is not existence" lack implicit intention? Because it raises commonly permitted "existence" as explicit statement and does not separate from real existence-nature.

Now I say: Since the original syllogism already takes implicit intention as explicit statement, citing this and raising "existence-nature" refers to great existence-nature. The words are merely abbreviated. It does not directly raise "great existence." Question: The original syllogism should also be so. "Existence-nature" and "great existence-nature" are broad and abbreviated expressions. How does this differ from contradiction? Answer: The explicit-implicit of the original syllogism is truly dual. The custom of establishing syllogisms necessarily carries implicit intention. Contradiction is negative designation. It directly negates that implicit intention. How could it extend to both aspects? If contradiction has implicit intention, could the predicate "not existence-nature" have implicit intention? If permitting this, how could implicit intention exist in two places? Also, various implicit intentions only accomplish their dharmas. There should not be implicit intention existing as dharma.

Regarding the sequence of subject particular-universal characteristics, contradicting particular-universal characteristics, and mutual commonality, this should be examined and determined.

○ Dharma particular-characteristics opponent
Kojima maintains the Buddhist disciple meaning. In the Nine Sentence Causes Record, he revises ancient masters' commentary explanations, further adding present examination to make it a secret teaching. Though the two-volume commentary transmission calls it Vaiśeṣika, that is not the real meaning. Merely following the Nine Sentence Commentary, tentatively raising it. Doesn't it fall short of clear explanations elsewhere? Now examining this meaning: since our own school already has true correct syllogisms, why set these aside and take heretical doubtful causes? Even if using many reasons to establish Vaiśeṣika transmission, I fear it would be difficult to counter this one principle. Among the four types of contradiction, the former is incorrect and the latter correct. That latter correctness is all Buddhist dharma. Breaking heretical heterodox theses and revealing Buddhist correct principles. Contradiction should definitely be our own school. Also, though both schools establish impermanence principles, Vaiśeṣika establishments still differ from Buddhist dharma. How could this be taken as ultimate correct principle? The commentary raises two correct aspects opposing two teachers. (Text) The Buddhist disciple transmission is ultimate proof. Dignāga's explanation of both as correct causes refers to the Nyāyamukha text "existing in similar cases and

absent in dissimilar cases - this is cause." Therefore the演祕 explains why Yulong断定 it as correct cause. Vaiśeṣika transmission's reconciliation falls short. Also, the Abbreviated Compilation's explanation should be clear proof. (Though there are other Buddhist disciple texts, they don't match these explanations, so I don't present them.)

Question: The Sound and Vaiśeṣika two schools disputed sound's permanence/impermanence at the kalpa's beginning. Akṣapāda took this and demonstrated the nine sentence causes. How could Dignāga not take it? Also, Buddhist logic extends to external schools and should first prioritize external syllogisms. Among external syllogisms, the sound permanence/impermanence dispute has easily known characteristics. Therefore all nine sentences use sound disputes as their procedures. Thus one should not find other matters strange. This track has existed since ancient times.

Answer: Sage Akṣapāda was Brahmā's transformation body, teacher of Vaiśeṣika heretics. Sound theorists are Ulūka's derivative calculations, emerging from Vaiśeṣika school. In this sequence, Akṣapāda's appearance preceded, Sound-Vaiśeṣika establishment followed. How could Akṣapāda, being earlier, judge later syllogisms' correctness and incorrectness? (Jōhin's commentary etc. should be consulted) Therefore this principle remains undetermined. Moreover, among the nine sentences, the fifth "audible" cause already opposes Buddhist disciples. How could this be kalpa-beginning establishment and opposition? Thus we know: though nine sentences' authenticity and imitation began at kalpa's beginning, they merely showed individual sentence characteristics without indicating their procedures. After Dignāga, revealing actual correct principles, taking Buddhist disciples' establishments as the twenty-eight correct causes.

Question: Though Buddhist disciple meaning has various texts, Vaiśeṣika transmission reconciles them without particular contradictions. Regarding commentary texts clarifying nine sentence establishers, it clearly states Vaiśeṣika. This is most difficult to reconcile.

Answer: Reconciling that text has multiple meanings. First, Dōsen says: The twenty-eight sentence establishers have two types. First is Vaiśeṣika, texts clarifying nine sentences. Second is Buddhist disciples, texts clarifying the two correct ones. Regarding uniform meaning

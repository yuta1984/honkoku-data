What opposition includes the substance-meaning disputed by syllogisms? If thesis-substance, then the upper volume of the commentary clarifies the three names of substance-meaning, using established conclusion substance-meaning to correspondingly match subject and predicate in order. From this we know that syllogistic thesis-basis is named "self-nature" and named "distinguishing characteristic." Also, the present commentary says: "First is particular, later is universal, therefore there are two distinguishing characteristics." (Text) "First-later" refers to first-stated later-stated thesis-basis. Also, the Decision says: "What is stated later necessarily penetrates to others." (Text) Also, the commentary's upper volume says: "Self-nature and distinguishing characteristics are both commonly established. They are merely thesis-basis and have not yet accomplished what is disputed." (Text) Answer: "Self-nature and distinguishing characteristics are merely thesis-basis, not what is established. They are the tools of what is established." (Text) This is using post-Dignāga Buddhist logic to reconcile the texts of Yogācāra and Abhidharma regarding "established conclusion self-nature and distinguishing characteristics." (This inquiry is extremely rare. Should be kept secret, should be kept secret.)

The commentary's upper volume says: "Now Dignāga makes causes and examples the establishing proof, and makes thesis the established conclusion. Self-nature and distinguishing characteristics are both commonly established, merely thesis-basis, not yet accomplishing what is disputed. Combining to form thesis, the non-separate nature becomes what is disputed. How could this be called establishing proof? ○" (Text)

It also says: "After Dignāga, there are briefly three explanations. The first says: the meaning expressed by thesis-statements is the established conclusion. Therefore, Yogācāra Treatise Volume 15 says: 'Established conclusion meaning has two types: first self-nature, second distinguishing characteristics. Establishing proof dharmas have eight types.' The thesis's expressive words and the words and meanings of causes, etc., are all called establishing proof. Since thesis words are accomplished by causes and examples, though they are previously established ○ they are not definitely established. Because they are capable of accomplishing meaning. ○ The meaning expressed by thesis is definitely only what is established. It alone is called 'what is accomplished.' The second says ○. The third says: self-nature and distinguishing characteristics, the combined basis-meaning, are called established conclusion. The dependent combined thesis is called establishing proof. ○"

"Self-nature and distinguishing characteristics are merely thesis-basis, not what is established. They are the tools of what is established. The meanings referred to are different and do not contradict. Otherwise, how could Maitreya and Vasubandhu not understand Buddhist logic? They speak of what is established for the sake of establishing proof." (Text)

The Decision says:
The Compilation Essentials says: "Question: Yogācāra and Abhidharma both take self-nature and distinguishing characteristics as what is established, and thesis as establishing proof. Why do Reasoning Gate and Entering Reasoning both commonly take thesis as what is established?" Answer: "First narrate ancient explanations, then describe present clarifications. Ancient explanations say: ○ The Cien Yogācāra Master also has three explanations. The first and last have no contradiction. The middle explanation seems erroneous ○ (there are difficulties and answers) therefore actually no error. Now explaining further: 'Established conclusion meaning having two types' refers only to principle, not teaching. Teaching is called thesis. Or thesis-establishing words establish that teaching-principle. Teaching follows the expression of principle and is also called self-nature and distinguishing characteristics. Thesis-establishing words may also be both teaching. This is called thesis because it is revered. Second, regarding self-nature and distinguishing characteristics: it is not only calling sound 'permanent' or 'impermanent' that is named self-nature and distinguishing characteristics. Also using first-stated later-stated explicitly-evident implicitly-intended as these respectively. Not wanting to combine the two as thesis-basis. This is merely the meaning of what is disputed - either disputing the subject, or disputing the predicate, or disputing the explicitly evident, or disputing the implicitly intended, or disputing both together. From this arise the four contradictory causes. Therefore Yogācāra, etc., say: 'Established conclusion self-nature means: establishing existence as existence, establishing non-existence as non-existence. This directly makes the subject into existence-nonexistence, not permitting other distinguishing characteristics on top of the subject.' This is called self-nature, like establishing 'self exists' and 'non-existence,' etc. Established conclusion distinguishing characteristics means: on top of existence

establishing on top of existence, on top of non-existence establishing on top of non-existence, establishing permanent as permanent, establishing impermanent as impermanent, etc. This disputes particular dharmas on top of the subject, like establishing sound as permanent or impermanent, etc. Following disputes regarding these self-nature and distinguishing characteristics ○" (Text)

Someone says: "Since it says the middle explanation 'seems erroneous,' does the second explanation not reach the first and last? Though there is remedial rescue, it still seems laborious. Among the first and last two explanations, the Bright Lamp Commentary takes the first explanation as Master Pure-Eye's doctrine and the third explanation as the commentary master's own doctrine. Reverend Myōsen, following the Village Record, considers the first explanation correct. Now temporarily following Myōsen, the first explanation should be preserved." The inner notes say: "The first explanation's meaning: thesis expressive words are called establishing proof; the expressed non-separate nature is called established conclusion. However, when Yogācāra speaks of self-nature and distinguishing characteristics as established conclusion, it is because non-separate nature does not separate from self-nature and distinguishing characteristics. This does not mean subject and predicate are the established conclusion." (Text) Many worthies agree with this. Question: "Though the first explanation says expressed meaning is the established conclusion, suddenly thesis-substance is not seen." Answer: "Regarding the thesis accomplished by causes and examples, we distinguish capable-expresser and expressed. If it were thesis-basis, why call it 'established conclusion'? Clearly know: regarding non-separate nature thesis, the capable-expresser is establishing proof and the expressed is established conclusion. Also, if the first opposition of self-nature and distinguishing characteristics were thesis-basis, it would merely re-display first-stated later-stated self-commonality, lacking the true dispute of syllogisms." Also, the Decision says: "What is stated later necessarily penetrates to others." (Text) It also says: "Raising Yogācāra to prove thesis, therefore must penetrate examples." (Text) If it were commonly-established predicate, why speak of penetrating examples? Later-stated impermanence is not limited to particular meanings on sound. It comprehensively takes all impermanence meanings. Why speak of penetrating others? Thesis-substance impermanence does not separate from sound-impermanence, therefore

it penetrates through jar-impermanence. Question: "If so, how do various places correspondingly match dharma-subject thesis-basis?" Answer: "Self-nature and distinguishing characteristics are the names of subject and predicate. This should be understood through the three names of substance-meaning. If so, self-nature and distinguishing characteristics are the names of thesis-basis dharma-subject. Non-separate nature thesis does not separate from thesis-basis self-nature and distinguishing characteristics. Therefore it speaks of 'established conclusion self-nature' and 'established conclusion distinguishing characteristics.' Myōsen explains this meaning." Question: "The Compilation quotes the commentary's three explanations, then states the supplementary explanation's meaning: 'This is merely the meaning of what is disputed - either disputing the subject or disputing the predicate,' etc. (Text) Taking disputed substance-meaning and calling it self-nature and distinguishing characteristics - is this the Compilation master's supplementary explanation? From this we know: do the commentary's three explanations all not speak of taking disputed thesis as established conclusion?" Answer: "In explaining capable-established meaning, the commentary has three explanations. The first explanation is capable-expresser/expressed opposition. The second explanation is total-collection/single-part opposition. The third explanation is dependent/basis opposition. Beyond this, the Compilation master marks 'now explaining further' - teaching-principle opposition. It also makes two explanations. From 'Second, regarding self-nature and distinguishing characteristics' onward, it still relies on the commentary's first explanation, taking disputed substance-meaning as self-nature and distinguishing characteristics. Otherwise, why would ancient worthies throughout history take explanations like 'either disputing subject or disputing predicate' as conventional characteristics rather than as a single supplementary explanation?"

Now I say: The self-nature and distinguishing characteristics of Yogācāra, etc., sometimes belong to thesis-substance. For instance, like the sound-impermanence syllogism, taking impermanence on sound as established conclusion distinguishing characteristics. Sometimes they belong to thesis-basis. Though speaking of sound's impermanence, that impermanence meaning remains in commonly-established impermanence predicate and obtains the distinguishing characteristic name. Therefore sometimes it extends to thesis-basis

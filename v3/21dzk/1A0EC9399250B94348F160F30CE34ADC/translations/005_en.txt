is thesis-substance. Combining the previous two meanings to discuss it. Or again, it belongs to nothing. The original true substance-meaning is neither thesis nor thesis-basis. The present three explanations, in opposition to establishing thesis within establishing proof, desire to distinguish their differences, therefore taking combined thesis as establishing thesis, and taking self-nature and distinguishing characteristics belonging to thesis-basis as what is established. This explanation's meaning does not fail to permit the gate belonging to thesis-substance. Therefore the first and last two explanations should not be accepted or rejected.

○ First-Later Opposition Universal Characteristics Meaning
Question: Regarding the first-stated later-stated opposition, since it distinguishes the previously stated, the later-stated is called universal characteristics. This should be the thesis of non-separate nature. Why call it thesis-basis? Answer: Commonly established thesis-basis refers to words mutually permitted by both sides. This is called thesis-basis as usual. But using this thesis-basis is to distinguish the first-stated and make it non-separate. That the later-stated should distinguish the first-stated is originally permitted by both establishers and opponents. Therefore it is called universal characteristics. Question: The present later-stated predicate has shallow and deep dual aspects. The aspect that properly becomes thesis-basis is shallow. Because dharma and subject are each separate and not mutually related. The aspect that distinguishes the previous and becomes universal is deep. Because the opponent does not permit it. Now among these shallow and deep dual aspects, which aspect is properly taken as the first-later opposition universal characteristics? If taking one and discarding one, it does not escape the previous difficulty. If separately combining both, it contradicts reason. Because establishment and rejection should be definite.
Answer: Do not abandon the two meanings. But the aspect that properly becomes thesis-basis is the commonly established aspect. Using this dharma-subject

commonly established thesis-basis is ultimately to make it non-separate - this establishers and opponents mutually understand. Therefore what now becomes thesis-basis commonly established dharma should be something that can be particular characteristics and universal characteristics. (Meaning) Question: If this meaning is so, taking the aspect of non-separate nature as universal characteristics - can this be the real meaning? Otherwise, among three aspects, one aspect of universal characteristics is lacking and stops, so why forcibly combine the commonly established aspect? Answer: The gate of particular-universal originally permits later-stated to penetrate the subject. This later-stated uses commonly established permitted things. Otherwise opponents and witnesses would be startled and not permit, so with what power could one establish the real established conclusion? This is the custom of thesis-basis common establishment. Now regarding these two gates, if one is lacking the syllogism does not stand. If permitting penetration to both, how could one not combine them? Even if setting aside the combination, if one side does not include this aspect, that is not so. Among the two, what to take as this aspect, what to discard as the remaining opposition? Also, what opposition is the remaining opposition? Question: The non-separate aspect can belong to particular-universal. That meaning is easy to know. Answer: Not so. The particular-universal opposition originally takes the original true substance or meaning of all dharmas as the gate of what Buddhist logic establishes. Once dharma-substance is decided, it definitely differs from first-later. (This is one) Even if first raising substance, then raising particular meaning, using meaning to distinguish dharma-substance - this gate does not become particular-universal universal characteristics. Penetrating other dharmas is the meaning of universality. (This is two) The universal characteristics of the two oppositions have greatly different meanings. They cannot be made to mix. Question: If so, do the first-later opposition universal characteristics not penetrate others? If saying they penetrate, they mix with particular-universal universal characteristics. If they don't penetrate, why does the later statement not penetrate examples? Like impermanence meaning penetrating jars. Also, the first-later opposition is called the accomplished/non-accomplished opposition. Using causes and examples to accomplish the later-stated, therefore called accomplished. Also, like thread penetrating flowers, one thread penetrating

various blue flowers. The many types of flowers are subjects and positive examples. Also saying "penetrating through others" - others refers to example-basis in opposition to subjects. Answer: Whether first-later opposition universal characteristics penetrate positive examples, or the meaning of not penetrating, can be well examined. Kojima's explanation says: "First-later faces upward, particular-universal flows downward." (etc.) This meaning is difficult to understand. Now what can be said temporarily is: the universal characteristics of both oppositions both penetrate up and down. Though both oppositions penetrate up and down, their meanings are still different. First-later opposition takes facing upward as fundamental, particular-universal takes flowing downward as fundamental. If discussing peripherally, first-later flows downward, particular-universal faces upward.

Question: Why are the fundamental intentions of both oppositions not the same? Answer: The particular-universal opposition - because all dharmas originally have substance-meaning, meaning naturally penetrates other dharmas. This is not what is now examined and established. The first-later opposition enters the gate of establishing syllogisms. Wanting to make opponents know meanings, therefore stating them in sequence. Using later-stated to distinguish the previously stated. Drawing examples merely assists in making this meaning known. The syllogism's meaning says: The meaning of particular-universal opposition originally penetrates others, therefore this is the primary intention. Later-stated meaning penetrating subject-substance is what is examined and established depending on the syllogism gate. Among first-later words, later-stated meaning desires to distinguish first-stated, therefore facing upward is fundamental. The intentions of the two oppositions should be carefully examined.

The established conclusion of particular-universal opposition and the established conclusion of first-later opposition later statement - their orientations are still different. In the first opposition, opponents do not yet know substance-meaning. Establishing to make them know is what is accomplished. Therefore substance is called accomplished. In first-later opposition, the subject is originally not what is accomplished. Using examples to analogically accomplish the predicate, therefore later statement is called accomplished. Now accomplishing borrows others' power. This is assisting accomplishment meaning. The deeper meaning says: First-later opposition concerns location - this placed thing is accomplished, that placed thing is not accomplished - this is the custom.

The accomplished of particular-universal opposition - what the establisher previously originally possessed, whether substance or meaning, is made my accomplished. If regarding any dharma, knowing this substance, this meaning does not exist, and though originally existing, if others commonly permit and already know it exists, it is not now established. In opposition to this it is called accomplished. Also, particular-universal opposition does not use later-stated to distinguish first-stated. Distinguishing is first-later opposition. The particular-universal opposition's meaning is: meaning exists on top of substance, therefore it penetrates the subject. Therefore though both face upward, the intentions of the two oppositions are different.

○ Explicitly Stated/Implicitly Intended Opposition Self-nature Distinguishing Characteristics Thesis-basis Thesis-substance
Previous examination says: thesis-substance. Question: How is this different from particular-universal? Answer: Particular-universal first determines the disputed substance-meaning of both theses. This is thesis-substance. First-later accomplishes that substance-meaning. This is thesis-basis. Explicitly stated/implicitly intended reveals the location where what is disputed resides.

Also, now inferring: thesis-basis. Implicitly intended is particular meaning under words. Things that should raise explicit statement are necessary. It is implicitly intended under words. Therefore it belongs to thesis-basis. Question: The predicate of the syllogism "necessarily for others' use" - the implicitly intended "self for others' use" - is this not the disputed thesis? It should most definitely be called thesis-substance. Answer: Taking that "self for others' use of eyes, etc." as (saying) non-separate nature thesis is thesis-substance. Merely saying "self for others' use" as an aspect is definitely not thesis-substance. That "self for others' use" under words belongs to explicitly stated "for others' use" and becomes thesis-basis. Because thesis-basis surface and back are divided into explicitly stated and implicitly intended.

Question: The Compilation explains syllogistic disputes, saying "sometimes disputing explicitly evident, sometimes disputing implicitly intended." (Text) Following this, explicitly stated and implicitly intended

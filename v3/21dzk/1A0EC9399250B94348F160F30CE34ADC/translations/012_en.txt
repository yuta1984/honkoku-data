"Established" is precisely "dharma." In syllogisms that accomplish dharma, the established actually belongs to the predicand, therefore the meaning of dharma is manifest.
If it is a syllogism accomplishing qualified-subjects, though the established is the qualified-subject, using that qualified-subject it is still called "established-dharma." Taking expedient means as meaning to accomplish it, making [others] see that this is dharma. This gate obtains the name "established-dharma."
Question: If relying on predicands to establish the name "dharma," how can one place qualified-subjects yet still call it "established-dharma"? Answer: Because previously there was dispute at the dharma location, what came to be established as "established-dharma." Therefore, though residing in the qualified, it is still called dharma. If viewing the qualified, it is also called qualified-subject.

The above completes the general accomplishment of two explanations.

The Established-Dharma of the Present Syllogism
"Existence-nature" is verbal expression. "Separate-from-reality great-existence-nature" is mental acceptance. "Non-reality" is the predicand's front. "Separate-from-reality having-substance" is the back. When the teacher-master establishes the present syllogism, first raising the qualified-subject words, mentally accepting and placing separate-from-reality existence-nature substance. This is called "qualified-subject mental acceptance." Establishing "non-reality" in the predicand, desiring to accomplish the meaning of separate-from-reality having-substance. Therefore, the established-dharma of the present syllogism has two layers. First, existence-nature and non-reality mutually differ, "existence-nature's non-reality" is called established-dharma. (First layer). The meaning accomplished by non-reality words - "separate from reality having substance" - regarding the qualified-subject is called "inseparability-nature." This is so-called "existence-nature's separate-from-reality having-substance." (Second layer). Sameness-difference-nature regarding the two-layer established-dharma is entirely equal. Therefore it becomes same-example. Though existence-nature substance is not the proper established-dharma, because the establisher secretly desires to make it belong to dharma, [it] is considered as different-example. Question: What is that meaning of belonging to dharma? If following the "established-dharma" explanation,

though the established encompasses existence-nature, dharma is one part of the established. It should only be limited to the meaning of separate-from-reality having-substance. When distinguishing two examples regarding established-dharma, how could sameness-difference-nature not being existence-nature be used to distinguish it as different-example? If again maintaining the "established-being-dharma" explanation, that established is predicand-dharma thesis. Regarding dharma there is no broad-narrow [distinction]. If both established and dharma penetrate qualified-subjects, in sound-impermanence syllogisms, how could sound be taken as established and dharma, with jar regarded as same-example to that? Though established-dharma extends across four theses, discussing same-different examples all regards that dharma. This is what Treatise on Logical Reasoning, Correct Reasoning original commentary, and Brief Compilation greatly establish. Answer: Following the "established-dharma" explanation, this meaning does not contradict. Disputing dharma and disputing qualified-subjects - comparative syllogism forms are originally divided, all permitted within correct Buddhist logic. Those syllogisms disputing qualified-subjects, though correct comparative syllogisms, necessarily have deceptive establishment. That deceptive establishment uses established qualified-subjects, secretly desiring to make them belong to that dharma. This is the power of inseparability-nature. Sound-impermanence syllogisms etc. originally dispute impermanence meaning, not disputing sound substance. Therefore in inseparability-nature total thesis, dispute barely remains in dharma. The establisher's willing-to-establish exhausts predicand words, not reaching sound substance. Teacher-disciple disputes originally exist in existence-category substance. How could it be the same as those syllogisms? Opponents explore and obtain that intention, using sameness-difference-nature to consider it as different-example. If not permitting this meaning, what benefit would deceptive establishment have? Question: Syllogisms disputing qualified-subjects and disputing dharma are originally permitted. Among them, syllogisms accomplishing qualified-subjects first accomplish dharma, then make qualified-subjects known. They do not directly dispute qualified-subjects at the predicand location. The Treatise on Logical Reasoning making two layers has its meaning here. If so, regardless of which syllogism, only regarding established-dharma are two examples judged. That dharma only belongs to

predicands. Though qualified-subjects and dharma have inseparability-nature, front-presentation back-explanation locations are completely unmoved. Using sound-impermanence syllogisms, that standard can be determined. Answer: Generally, though established-dharma belongs to the location of thesis-basis, it is not proper thesis-basis. (This is one layer). Also regarding total thesis, in dharma-specific-characteristic syllogisms, the two parts are each determined, belonging to dharma-qualified-subjects. (This is two layers). Deceptive establishment syllogisms dispute qualified-subjects, using mental-acceptance thesis regarding total thesis two parts, belonging is indeterminate. Sometimes above, sometimes below. Not the same as verbal-expression thesis where that location is determined. This is precisely because of deceptively establishing "non-reality." In that non-reality word-back, constructing thoroughfares, making qualified-subject-below mental acceptance travel up and down. Those thoroughfares are separate-from-reality having-substance meaning. That substance is precisely great-existence-nature. Separate-from-reality great-existence-nature's substance is what having-substance meaning targets. Substance-meaning is inconceivable, mutually inseparable. If verbal expression manifestly establishes having-substance, because words lack subtlety, disputes can remain in predicands. Because establishment is extremely subtle, great-existence-nature substance sometimes belongs to predicands obtaining dharma names, sometimes belongs to qualifieds called qualified-subjects. Layer upon layer, front and back - scholars should comprehend this fully. "Thus establishing in qualified-subjects" is the treatise's ultimate. Using sameness-difference-nature to consider different-examples differs from this - though qualified-subjects, still making [them] seen as dharma, the gate of desiring to accomplish this through same-example power. The aspect of accomplishing that dharma only through dharma. If not permitting this meaning, would this syllogism's dispute be barely limited to separate-from-reality having-substance meaning, not reaching great-existence substance? If accomplishing through development, this would just be self-comparative syllogism, using existence-nonexistence predicands, accomplishing one-layer establishment completed, subtly transmitting to make qualified-subjects known - would this be the aspect? Deceptive establishment syllogisms definitely transcend that. Using qualified-subject substance to accomplish dharma locations below, because desiring to receive cause-example power.

Or in established-dharma, syllogisms disputing dharma are "established-dharma." Syllogisms disputing qualified-subjects are "established-being-dharma." Because where disputes reach has broad-narrow [distinctions]. Existence-nature substance and separate-from-reality having-substance meaning are both what the present syllogism disputes. Calling it "established," calling it "thesis," calling it "disputed" - all are one thing. If existence-nature substance is what established total-thesis encompasses, why not face same-different examples?
Question: If total thesis is all called dharma, why also call it qualified-subject and examine qualified-subject specific-characteristic contradiction? Also, like this meaning, what cause-examples accomplish should only be one layer - why say both "accomplish that dharma only through dharma" and "thus establish in qualified-subjects"? Answer: Existence-nature substance belongs to having-substance meaning, disputed at non-reality predicand locations, therefore given the dharma name. However, ultimately discussing what remains, it also obtains the qualified-subject name. Therefore in Treatise on Logical Reasoning's two phrases, what is encompassed is indeterminate. Already called qualified-subject, therefore what cause-examples accomplish has two layers. Therefore there is the meaning of "thus establishing in qualified-subjects." Question: Inseparability-nature is discussed regarding verbal-expression dharma-qualified-subjects - why by this meaning does mental-acceptance separate-from-reality existence-nature belong to having-substance predicands? Answer: Yes. Front-presentation back-explanation - verbal expressions face each other, mutually differing, called inseparability-nature. Only verbal-expression total existence-nature, with predicand non-reality and separate-from-reality having-substance meaning, mutually differing, becoming total thesis completed, qualified-subject-below mental-acceptance separate-from-reality great-existence-nature then obtains establishment. Qualified-subjects raise it as substance, predicands dispute it as meaning. Because substance does not separate from meaning, that substance obtains the dharma name. This is the power of inseparability-nature.

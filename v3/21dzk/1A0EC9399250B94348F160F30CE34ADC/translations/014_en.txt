This is the meaning.

Fourteenth interpretation: Mental acceptance exists in the qualified-subject, dispute exists in the predicand. In all comparative syllogisms, what is disputed necessarily exists in the predicand. This is made the established-dharma. The location of mental acceptance is indefinite according to the syllogism. In the existence-nature non-reality syllogism, mental acceptance exists in the qualified-subject, disputing it under the predicand's non-reality words.

This meaning is perhaps Kojima's original intent. The later two contradictory mental-acceptance theses both exist at the qualified-subject existence-nature location. Established-dharma necessarily exists in the predicand. This is made the disputed matter. That dispute exists in qualified-subjects is perhaps not the senior monk's intention. At Master San's Lotus Assembly, this meaning was established.

The above fourteen meanings are all qualified-subject mental-acceptance transmissions. Among them, the first thirteen determine disputed meanings according to mental acceptance location. The latter meaning differs in that mental acceptance and the disputed have different meanings. Among the first thirteen, the first seven are two-layer established-dharmas. The latter six are only single-layer established.

Fifteenth interpretation: Under qualified-subjects there is completely no mental acceptance. Under non-reality predicands, it carries separate-from-reality great-existence mental acceptance. Later it attaches to qualified-subject existence-nature.

Sixteenth interpretation: When initially presenting qualified-subjects, under existence-nature words, there is separate-from-reality great-existence-nature mental acceptance. Establishing non-reality words accomplishes separate-from-reality meaning. That mental acceptance under existence-nature descends and temporarily exists under predicands, called predicand mental acceptance. Finally returning to qualified-subject existence-nature substance. Therefore it is said to attach to qualified-subjects.

Seventeenth interpretation: Among the three layers of separate-from-reality having-substance existence-nature, separate-from-reality having-substance is the verbal-expression portion.

Because it is the meaning manifested by non-reality words. Existence-nature is mental acceptance. Regarding this as different-example. Because it is mental acceptance under predicands, it obtains the dharma name following words.

Eighteenth interpretation: Separate-from-reality having-substance existence-nature are all mental acceptance. That mental acceptance also has front-back two layers. Having-substance is front, existence-nature is back. Regarding front as equal, regarding back as different-example. Obtaining the dharma name is like the previous meaning.

Inquiry: Mutually permitted substance-meaning should be raised as verbal expression. Separate-from-reality having-substance meaning is not what opponents don't permit. Why make it mental acceptance portion? Answer: The teacher's deceptive establishment is profound. Verbal permission extends to many layers. Even in mind, showing separate-from-reality having-substance meaning as what is established. Regarding this, same-examples are judged. Great-existence substance is hidden in the back, establishing that accomplishing meaning naturally establishes that substance.

Nineteenth interpretation: Because of inseparability-nature, though great-existence-nature substance descends and belongs to separate-from-reality having-substance predicand meaning, what same-examples reach is having-substance verbal-expression portion. Now reaching one layer to great-existence-nature is precisely mental acceptance.

Twentieth interpretation: Predicand mental acceptance is only separate-from-reality having-substance two layers. Existence-nature substance is not mental acceptance portion. At predicand locations accomplishing the meaning of being separate-from-reality and having-substance benefits and accomplishes obtaining existence-nature substance. Like the possessed fire substance in "fire exists at the mountain" syllogisms. In "necessarily for others' use" syllogisms, capable-use true-others etc. are also thus.

Twenty-first interpretation: Among the three layers of separate-from-reality having-substance existence-nature, the first two layers are precisely mental acceptance under predicands

The existence-nature called having-substance is precisely qualified-subject existence-nature. Being drawn by separate-from-reality having-substance meaning, it descends and belongs to predicands. This is called predicand mental acceptance. The two layers of separate-from-reality having-substance belong to existence-nature substance and also return to qualified-subject substance. "Attaching to qualified-subjects" refers to this meaning-gate.

Twenty-second interpretation: Existence-nature definitely exists in qualified-subjects. Under predicands only mentally accepts separate-from-reality having-substance meaning. That having-substance is precisely the meaning of having existence-nature substance. Therefore existence-nature substance exists in predicands as meaning. Existing in predicands as having-substance meaning, existing in qualified-subjects as existence-nature substance.

Twenty-third interpretation: Having-substance means having great-existence substance. Therefore predicands mentally accepting great-existence substance is precisely the having-substance layer.

Twenty-fourth interpretation: Mental acceptance has two types. Under qualified-subject existence-nature, mentally calling separate-from-reality great-existence-nature. This is one. Reaching predicands immediately accomplishes the previous separate-from-reality having-substance great-existence-nature. This is two. What accomplishes is called mental acceptance, existing in predicands. What is accomplished is called mental acceptance, existing in qualified-subjects. As follows, they can be called capable-mental-acceptance and object-mental-acceptance. Among these, capable-mental-acceptance is called mental acceptance.

The above ten meanings are all predicand mental-acceptance transmissions.

Twenty-fifth interpretation: Mental acceptance has two types. First, differential meaning carried under words is called mental acceptance. Like saying "because it is particular meaning expressed in words." This exists exclusively in qualified-subjects. Separate-from-reality existence-nature mental acceptance carries existence-nature verbal expression. If depending on establishment meaning, it exists only in predicands. What accomplishes and what is not accomplished are opposites. This is the meaning-gate. Mental acceptance has two categories. Various places each discuss one gate.

【Lower section】
This meaning's intent: Mental acceptance meaning originally has two categories. According to appropriateness, sometimes said to exist in qualified-subjects, sometimes said to exist in predicands. Left and right should discuss their locations.

Twenty-sixth interpretation: This syllogism's mental-acceptance thesis is separate-from-reality having-substance existence-nature. Separate-from-reality having-substance is mental acceptance under non-reality words. Existence-nature substance also follows meaning and belongs to predicands. Great-existence-nature is mental acceptance under qualified-subjects. Separate-from-reality having-substance meaning also belongs to substance and exists in qualified-subjects. Substance follows meaning and exists in predicands, meaning follows substance and exists in qualified-subjects. In one moment, according to response, it exists in two places.

Twenty-seventh interpretation: In the one mental acceptance of separate-from-reality having-substance existence-nature, the substance aspect of existence-nature exists at the qualified-subject location, the separate-from-reality having-substance meaning aspect exists under non-reality predicands.

The above three meanings have mental acceptance penetrating two locations.

Twenty-eighth interpretation: Under inseparability-nature total thesis, one mental acceptance is manifestly obtained. Namely separate-from-reality great-existence-nature. One should not say it definitely exists in qualified-subjects. Also should not say it definitely exists in predicands. Also not that substance exists in qualified-subjects and meaning exists in predicands. Also not that substance-meaning mutually follow and accordingly exist in two places. Only under inseparability-nature total thesis, there is one mental acceptance of great-existence-nature that is separate-from-reality and has substance.

This meaning generally belongs to total thesis.

Twenty-ninth interpretation: The commentary and compendium have different intentions. The commentary's intent exists in qualified-subjects, the compendium's intent exists in predicands. The Matsumuro Record perhaps saw this point.

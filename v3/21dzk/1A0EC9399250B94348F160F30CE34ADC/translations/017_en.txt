In syllogisms etc., since originally disputing the predicand, correct dispute doesn't extend to the qualified-subject. However, sound still obtains the name "what is established." If one were to prejudicially dislike this, it would violate various commentarial texts. 《The above is one side's questions and answers.》
　○Concerning the established dharma in the current syllogism
"Existence-nature" is verbal expression. "Great-existence-nature separate from reality" is mental acceptance. "Non-reality" is the surface of the predicand. "Having substance separate from reality" is the reverse side. Having verbal expression, mental acceptance, surface and reverse side in this way is called a deceptive-establishment syllogism. If it weren't deceptive establishment, it would be necessary to establish as a self-inference syllogism: "The great-existence-nature I explain should have separate substance." However, among self-other-shared [inferences], shared-inference is fundamental. In disputing dharma and qualified-subjects, since exhausting what is established in dharma-thesis is the original intent, the teacher establishes a shared-inference syllogism. At the place of the predicand's "non-reality" words, wanting to accomplish great-existence-nature separate from reality, when first raising the qualified-subject's words, mentally accepting and placing separate-from-reality great-existence-nature substance. In the predicand, not saying "should have separate substance," using profound "non-reality" words. Behind those words saying "existence-nature has substance separate from reality." That having-substance is the existence-nature raised in the qualified-subject. 《This approach, looking toward general existence-nature, doesn't yet reach great-existence-nature separate from reality.》
How do we know this? The inseparable-nature total thesis of this syllogism means qualified-subject and "non-reality" mutually distinguish each other, naming existence-nature's non-reality as the established dharma. 《First level》. However, behind non-reality, since there is substance separate from reality, this is still verbal expression. Looking toward the qualified-subject with this, it's named inseparable-nature. Namely, existence-nature's separate-from-reality having-substance. 《Second level》. Here existence-nature is already included in the total thesis. It also obtains the name "what is established." Already called thesis and called what is established. In the establisher's original intent, secretly using that total

thesis, all have what is disputed. However, although same-different nature is equal looking toward the one part of separate-from-reality having-substance, looking toward existence-nature it's a different example. 《Combining all as what is established, not reaching the two parts.》 Therefore examined as qualified-subject self-characteristic contradiction. If existence-nature doesn't include what is established, how could the thesis meaning obtain satisfaction? Also, what would one use to look toward that and discuss same-different examples? In the original commentary's questions and answers, Meaning-Severing and other commentaries, if not permitting this meaning, probably all wouldn't meet the contradiction between both treatises—what would serve as the intended meaning?
Question: Though qualified-subject verbal expression/mental acceptance meaning and predicand surface/reverse meaning all have doubts ■ acceptance. Relying on inseparable-nature, looking toward qualified-subject existence-nature, the meaning of determining same-different examples is extremely improper. The established dharma now being accomplished—is it "dharma of what is established" or "what is established as dharma"? Regarding these two meanings, even if maintaining either interpretation, this meaning all fails to establish. If maintaining the "dharma of what is established" interpretation, even if what is established includes existence-nature, dharma is one part of what is established. It should only be limited to the meaning of separate-from-reality having-substance. Looking toward "dharma of what is established," when judging the two categories, how could one judge same-different nature as different categories by not being existence-nature? If maintaining the "what is established as dharma" meaning, that what is established is what the predicand manifests, returning to be the same as the previous meaning's dharma boundaries. One should discuss the two categories looking toward this. Since the two meanings' scope finally becomes the same. What is now accomplished all isn't the original intent. If what is established broadly extends through dharma and qualified-subjects, therefore corresponding to the two categories, in the sound-impermanence syllogism, how could one make sound what is established and make jar, looking toward that, a same-example? Though established dharma extends across the four theses, discussing same-different examples all looks toward that dharma. Logic Gate, Correct Logic, Original Commentary, Severing Compilation—

have completely no different meanings. If so, the current meaning's force greatly seems to lose the great principles of logic.
Answer: The general purport of the inquiry should be so. However, disputing dharma and disputing qualified-subjects are all correct logical principles. The appearance of those syllogisms has various distinctions. If prejudicially using dharma self-characteristics to determine everything, why would established dharma extend across the four theses? On what do the latter three contradictions depend to arise? Depending on this, what do we know? In established dharma, syllogisms disputing dharma are "dharma of what is established." Syllogisms disputing qualified-subjects are "what is established as dharma." This is precisely because what dispute reaches has scope differences. Therefore, existence-nature's meaning of having substance separate from reality, without remainder, can all be what the current syllogism disputes. Saying "what is established," saying "thesis," saying "what is disputed"—all are one thing. If what is established is included in the total thesis, why not correspond to same-different examples?
Question: If the current total thesis is all named dharma, why also name it qualified-subject and examine qualified-subject self-characteristic contradiction? Here we know: correctly disputing separate-from-reality having-substance meaning, finally manifesting existence-nature substance. Logic Gate saying "only through dharma accomplishing that dharma" is the first level. What reason-example correctly reaches. "Thus established in qualified-subjects" is the second level. Using the established predicand, finally exploring that meaning. This is existence-nature's having-substance. 《So to speak》. If like the current meaning, there would only be the first level, wouldn't it fail to reach saying "benefiting qualified-subjects"?
Answer: Established existence-nature, if looking toward what the establisher enjoys, can be named dharma. Because of inseparable-nature, using existence-nature to belong to having-substance, all disputing this at the place of non-reality predicand. If

maintaining the syllogism's position, discussing what finally remains, it can be named qualified-subject. Therefore the current established dharma, in Logic Gate Treatise's two phrases, what it includes is indefinite. Question: During inseparable-nature, only saying existence-nature without interpreting separate-from-reality having-nature—is this verbal expression, not mental acceptance? Answer: The meaning of inseparable-nature originally has front-statement rear-statement verbal expressions mutually corresponding, mutually distinguishing each other. Existence-nature is general existence-nature. If it becomes what total thesis accomplishes, looking back at that qualified-subject, it's precisely the previously mentally accepted separate-from-reality great-existence-nature that can receive establishment. However, during qualified-subject time it's raised as substance; under the predicand, it's disputed as meaning. Meaning is inseparable. During inseparable time, substance is first called, having-substance meaning lies below. The intent is one thing. Question: If so, does this established dharma first have qualified-subject, next lower the predicand, then return to remain in qualified-subject? Answer: If discussing meaning sequence, even permitting this, what fault would there be? However, just the established mental acceptance from beginning to end lies in the qualified-subject. Using expedients, deceptively disputing this at the predicand's place. Really having no same-example things, wanting to make them equal to same-examples. Having such circumlocution for this reason. If qualified-subjects had no mental acceptance and predicands had no surface-reverse, the meaning of flexible scope would be completely unobtainable. Question: Because established dharma is dharma, naming existence-nature as dharma—does this rely on predicand dharma-names or not? Answer: Yes. Relying on "non-reality" words wanting to manifest. Therefore establishing dharma-names.
Also considering, one meaning says: The general purport is all like before. However, the latter two contradictions are still established dharma. The meaning of mutual distinction is inevitable. Therefore existence-nature lies in front, separate-from-reality having-

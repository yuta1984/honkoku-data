Substance lies later. Speaking based on these two syllogisms, "having substance separate from reality" is named dharma. Having thus determined the meaning of established dharma, the substance of that having-substance immediately manifests existence-nature. This is the establisher's deceptive establishment. What was previously one part of the total thesis, not yet obtaining dharma-name, actually relies on the place of having-substance to become dharma. Wanting to receive the power of same-examples, it's included in dharma-name. In Kojima's commentary, separately saying "having-substance"—is this perhaps that meaning?

Question: This meaning still doesn't escape difficulty. When establishing dharma-name, since there's already no remaining thing, what does one call qualified-subject in relation to? Answer: When determining and establishing general characteristics, it's already the meaning of established dharma. Without changing that approach, existence-nature still being drawn to the place of having-substance is the intention of insistently wanting to include it in dharma. Dharma-approaches are like this—circumlocution is not absent. When Qingbian raised conditioned-existence to establish emptiness, emptiness was also not conditioned-existence. However, they're actually one thing. When the predicand says emptiness, how could one criticize accomplishing non-conditioned-existence as accomplishing the absence of qualified-subjects? To reiterate: initially "conditioned-existence" is first spoken as what-is-qualified, later that substance is precisely emptiness, losing the name-substance of conditioned-existence. Thus existence-nature and having-substance first have before-after, becoming two parts. Even if saying one part is dharma, actually that existence-nature being precisely having-substance as substance is dharma, with no remaining things above. What fault would there be? This syllogism's deceptive establishment and the manner of examining errors quite obtains the point. In established dharma, the two meanings of dharma-as-such and qualified-subjects should be used according to people's minds. This is a minor matter. Strive not to be attached to it.

《The following questions and answers were stopped》
Question: Regarding the existence-nature non-reality syllogism, is the established dharma the meaning of separate-from-reality having-substance, or does it extend to existence-nature substance? Answer: What is established is inseparable-nature. Existence-nature and separate-from-reality having-substance don't separate from each other, generally named the established thesis. Among these, what is called dharma has surface and reverse. In the establisher's original intent, wanting to include existence-nature. The characteristic manifested by the three members is non-reality. Though the reverse of non-reality is separate-from-reality having-substance, it doesn't reach existence-nature. However, speaking in ordinary terms, existence-nature doesn't obtain the name of established dharma. It also equally exists among the established dharmas in the thesis. Speaking in terms of actual meaning, it's not merely having-substance but secretly includes existence-nature, making it the established dharma, so this error is precisely that. If not including the latter meaning, it would generally be difficult to have the latter two contradictions. Question: That what is established extends through dharma and qualified-subjects originally has two meanings. Even using the meaning of "dharma of what is established," the qualified-subject establishing the name "what is established" is not the correct establishment of the established syllogism. It only discusses the approach of inseparable-nature in relation to thesis-basis. If using the name of "what is established in the total thesis" as evidence for this meaning, is the sound in the total thesis of the sound-impermanence syllogism what is disputed? Since that's already not so, we know that though qualified-subjects are included in the total thesis, they're completely not disputed. Also not corresponding to same-categories. Originally not corresponding, there's no procedure for examining and accomplishing different categories. Therefore, using categories equal to established dharma, discussing equality in relation to dharma. If the current meaning permits "dharma of what is established," why use the two established dharmas to examine different categories looking toward qualified-subjects? Answer: When naming total thesis, thesis-name is established; when calling what is

established, what is disputed is permitted. If like the difficulty's force, it seems useless. There must be deep reasons. However, what is now described again judges the two categories looking toward dharma, not directly looking toward qualified-subjects. The reason is that disputing predicands and disputing qualified-subjects are originally the syllogism's natural form, among correct logical principles, all previously permitted. Those syllogisms disputing qualified-subjects, though correct syllogisms, are not without deceptive establishment. That deceptive establishment means using the established qualified-subject, secretly wanting to make it belong to dharma. This is the power of inseparable-nature. However, sound-impermanence syllogisms etc. originally dispute impermanence-meaning. Since sound-substance isn't disputed, within inseparable-nature total thesis, only dharma is barely disputed. Since thesis-meaning is exhausted, it doesn't reach sound-substance. Judging two categories is originally limited to impermanence. What is established is easy to accomplish. Therefore what-is-qualified and predicand have no mental acceptance. No deceptive establishment. Why would it extend to different meanings? Teacher-disciples raise originally existing phrase-substances. The existence-nature non-reality syllogism has hidden word-force. Deceptive establishment is inevitable. The establisher's intent, relying on predicand dharma, wants to accomplish what-is-qualified substance. Within inseparable-nature, disputingly remaining in substance. How could that substance not be what is established? However, though dharma-meaning is hidden, it still wants to be dharma. Opponents explore that intention, examining and accomplishing different categories. If not permitting this meaning, what benefit would deceptive establishment have?

Question: Syllogisms disputing qualified-subjects and disputing dharma are originally permitted. Among these, first accomplishing dharma, finally making qualified-subjects known. Not directly raising qualified-subjects at the predicand's place. Logic Gate Treatise explains this as two levels. That purport is clear. However, only looking toward established dharma to judge two categories. That dharma only belongs to predicands. Qualified-subjects definitely belong to what-is-qualified. Even with inseparable-nature, the location doesn't move at all.

Sound-impermanence syllogisms should determine the standard. Even if syllogism-force differs, in deceptive establishment syllogisms' practice, accomplishing qualified-subjects originally should not speak of accomplishing established dharma. Why rely on meaning in two directions, returning to lose the two approaches? The meaning of inseparable-nature is completely not evidence. This can be known through sound-syllogisms. Answer: Though established dharma belongs to the place of thesis-basis, it's not correct thesis-basis. 《This is one level》. Among these, dharma self-characteristic syllogisms have total thesis two parts, each definitely belonging to dharma and qualified-subjects. 《This is one level》. Deceptive establishment syllogisms dispute qualified-subjects. That total thesis is flexible. One approach belongs below, one approach belongs above. 《Initially above, next below, later returning above. This initial-middle-final is not temporal sequence but meaning sequence.》 That the belonging is indefinite is because it lies under words, not being correct verbal expression. Predicands must establish separate-from-reality having-substance. Deceptively establishing non-reality means constructing pathways in the reverse, making qualified-subject mental acceptance travel. Therefore having substance separate from reality. That substance is precisely great existence-nature. Separate-from-reality great-existence-nature substance is what the meaning of having-substance aims at. Inconceivably inseparable. If verbal expression clearly established separate having-substance, those words would have no circumlocution. That place's total thesis should only remain in predicands. Since what is spoken is already clear, separate-from-reality great-existence-nature has no reason to belong to it. The current syllogism has layered surface-reverse. Completely incomparable. However, Logic Gate saying "thus established in qualified-subjects" discusses that ultimate, raising it when the mentally accepted great-existence-nature finally becomes named what is established. The approach of using same-different nature to examine and accomplish different categories differs slightly from the previous level. Though established qualified-subjects, still making them appear as dharma, the approach wanting to accomplish this through same-example power. Only through dharma accomplishing that dharma's portion

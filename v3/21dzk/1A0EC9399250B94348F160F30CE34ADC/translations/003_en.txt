Where disputes come to rest. Among these, on the surface it shows accomplishing meaning. Therefore, the single-level established conclusions of all syllogisms necessarily lie in the predicate. Also, benefiting what is to be accomplished reaches the subject. Therefore, there is no lack of approaches that take the antecedent as what is to be accomplished.

　　The above is one proposal. The fundamental doctrine is like that in Myōhon.

　Different Types of Syllogisms (distinguishing according to fundamental doctrine)
1. Meaning-approach meaning. (Sound-impermanence syllogism. Impermanence meaning approach. Immediately accomplishes impermanence meaning. Does not return to sound substance.)
2. Meaning-approach substance. (Necessarily-for-others'-use syllogism. For-others'-use meaning approach. Accomplishes the substance of divine self, does not return to eyes, etc.)

　This syllogism's established conclusion has three levels. First is the explicitly stated "for others' use" - the meaning of being used that is on eyes, etc. Second is the implicitly intended "truly for others' use" - the meaning of being used by true others that is on eyes, etc. Third is the substance of the capable user - the originally disputed substance. The first two levels both accomplish the meaning of being used that is on eyes, etc. As a means to this, they progressively accomplish the capable-using divine self. This is what "meaning-approach accomplishing substance" means. The first two levels are what the syllogism establishes. The latter level is what the original intent accomplishes. It is neither an explicitly stated thesis nor an implicitly intended thesis. Or taking the first two levels as what this syllogism disputes, it is therefore a meaning-accomplishing syllogism. The divine self substance is completely not what the syllogism-establishing approach disputes. The implicitly intended true-others'-use is carried along and self-evident. Therefore it becomes what this syllogism accomplishes. It is not disputed in the syllogism-establishing approach. According to this doctrine, the necessarily-for-others'-use syllogism is meaning-approach meaning.

3. Substance-approach substance. (Existence-non-real syllogism. Existence substance approach. Accomplishes separate-from-real existence substance. Returns to great existence substance.)
4. Substance-approach meaning. (Acting-as-existence-condition syllogism. Existence substance approach. Accomplishes acting-as-existence-condition meaning, ultimately returning to great existence.)

　Now, relying on carrying the meaning of implicitly intended "acting as great-existence condition" under the subject "existence," this becomes substance-approach meaning. Even though implicit intention is meaning, the explicitly stated dharma and subject have substance and meaning in accord. The subject "existence" is substance. The predicate "non-real" or "acting as existence condition" is meaning. (This is one doctrine.) Or "acting as great-existence condition" - its substance is ultimately great existence. Therefore implicit intention is also substance. (This is also one doctrine.)

　Question: What is the mountain-location-has-fire syllogism among the above four categories?
　Answer: What the syllogism approach disputes is the mountain-location-has-fire meaning. It does not take the possessed fire. However, since benefiting what is accomplished already reaches fire substance, it is meaning-approach substance. Question: Fire substance is commonly accepted. What is there to dispute? It is not the same as "truly for others." Answer: Seeing a red object at a distant mountain location, one person says it is fire, another says it is not fire. From this dispute arises. Eventually a syllogism is established. But wanting to directly raise fire substance, there is no positive example. Therefore it accomplishes the meaning of "mountain location having fire," beneficially ultimately accomplishing fire substance. How could this not be what the syllogism disputes? Even though not implicit intention, it accomplishes substance as a means. Therefore does the established conclusion reach two levels? The "other regions have Buddha" syllogism is also the same. (This doctrine is detailed in Myōhon.)

　Or the mountain-location-has-fire syllogism is meaning-approach meaning. If it accomplishes substance, would this syllogism be an implicit-intention syllogism? Because disputed dharma-substance must be placed in second-category implicit intention. If this were made a single-level established conclusion, there would be no positive example. Moreover, disputed substances must be non-commonly-established dharmas, like the heterodox divine self, etc. But fire dharma-substance is commonly known in the world and undisputed. How could one say it accomplishes fire substance? Therefore it should be said: taking the meaning of mountain-location's capability to have fire as the established conclusion, not taking the possessed fire

　substance. Therefore the Compilation says: "Taking the meaning of having fire as dharma, not immediately taking the possessed fire." (Text) Here we know this syllogism is an explicitly evident syllogism. It completely does not reach corrective establishment. The established conclusion is only single-level. Syllogisms disputing dharma-substance necessarily have two-level established conclusions, like the latter three contradictions.

　Question: When the Compilation says "not immediately taking the possessed fire," does this mean the explicit statement accomplishes having-fire meaning, not taking possessed fire substance? If benefiting and accomplishing allows fire to have a subject, then the dispute ultimately rests in fire substance. Also, the later text says: "This approach temporarily takes the single approach of substance-meaning for difficulties and explanations." (Text) Above and below are all syllogisms accomplishing substance. Answer: Benefiting and accomplishing means that after establishing this syllogism, the opponent knows the portion of having fire substance. In the syllogism approach, there is ultimately the meaning of substantial nature - how could this not relate to what the syllogism accomplishes?

　　Among the above two doctrines, the former is conventional. The latter also is not without reasoning. This is what I concluded years ago.

　Question: Even if it were dharma-substance, creating meaning as the established conclusion - if so, at this time, since the former name has already changed, could this be called "name-obtaining indeterminacy"?

　Answer: It does not create meaning. Substance is definitely substance and completely unchanging. But adding meaning on top of that substance, it transmits to accomplish substance. When saying "others use eyes, etc.," that "other" is only self-nature. It does not change to distinguishing characteristic. When adding the meaning of "using eyes, etc." on top of that other-dharma substance, it penetrates through positive examples. Therefore substance-meaning name-obtaining is definitely unchanging. In before-after opposition, before is in the qualified term, obtaining self-

　nature name. Now placed in the qualifier, changing to distinguishing-characteristic name. Why is this so? Thesis-basis is determined exclusively regarding syllogisms. Thesis-substance points to dharma's true substantial meaning. Therefore there is this difference.

　Someone asks: Is particular-universal opposition regarding self-nature and distinguishing characteristics thesis-basis or thesis-substance? If thesis-basis, then in Abhidharmakośa treatise regulations and decisions, and Yogācāra Buddhist logic sections, explaining treatise-basis, the established conclusion raises two types of self-nature and distinguishing characteristics, and the establishing proof divides into eight types including establishing thesis and distinguishing causes. Since syllogism thesis-basis is already establishing proof, know that the two types of established conclusion are not dharma-subject thesis-basis. Therefore, in Gidan's explanation of the four Buddhist logic oppositions, pointing to the two oppositions of substance-meaning and general-particular, it says "temporarily following what is disputed does not exceed these two." (Text) Explaining before-after opposition, "immediately distinguishing thesis-basis is this." (Text) Clearly knowing: substance-meaning opposition is disputed substance-meaning; before-after opposition is dharma-subject thesis-basis. Also, Compilation Essentials asks: "Since it speaks of 'established conclusion having two,' should both necessarily be accomplished, or should one be accomplished?" (Text) Answering this: "Accomplish according to what is disputed." (Text) Asking again: "If so, why call it 'established conclusion having two'?" (Text) The meaning is: if following what is disputed, taking either self-nature or distinguishing characteristic as the established conclusion, why do Yogācāra, etc., speak of "established conclusion having two types"? Answering: "The meaning of what is disputed does not exceed these two." (Text) The meaning is easy to understand. Also, explaining the text "established conclusion having two types," it says: "Not wanting to combine the two to make thesis-basis. This is just the meaning of what is disputed - either disputing the subject or disputing the predicate." (Text) Also, the three-fold opposition can completely include all self-nature and distinguishing characteristics. If particular-universal opposition regarding self-nature and distinguishing characteristics is not thesis-substance, then the comparison

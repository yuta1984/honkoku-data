It is existing-nature. "Definitely separate from eye-consciousness form" refers to form grasped external to mind. Its substance truly differs from unwilling-to-establish. Unwilling-to-establish is commonly accepted, but it is a verbal portion. Hypothetical self-use inferior adds the character "inferior" to the original verbal expression, so changing it incurs no fault. Question: Why are there two categories of same and different? Answer: When making meaning upon qualified-subjects into unwilling-to-establish, it has the same substance as contradicting theses. Hypothetical-use particulars are precisely that category. If not so, necessarily taking prior objects as single particulars, establishing contradicting thesis-dharmas as meanings upon qualified-subjects, therefore changing the substance of unwillingness.

One who grasps this point [knows that] taking opponent's thesis as unwilling-to-establish is definitely erroneous.

○ The Matter of Aggregation-Nature Cause Contradicting Dharma-Specific-Characteristics
Kojima Commentary states: "Eyes etc. are definitely not received and used by divine self" (text). Shū Commentary states: "Not self-use." Hebi states: "Definitely not used by self." Dōsen states: "Not true other-use." Myōsen states: "Eyes etc. are definitely non-use regarding divine self." Though these procedural words differ slightly, their meanings are largely the same. "Self" means divine self. "Use" means use-superior. The commentary texts should be examined in detail.

Question: The fault of predicand-non-establishment is difficult to block. Answer: Kojima's explanation states: "To refute others, established according to other schools, therefore there is no fault of non-establishment" (etc.). According to the Compilation Essentials' statement, "To refute others, established according to other schools. Though there is qualified-subject foundation non-establishment, it does not constitute a fault," the explanatory meaning can be grasped. Dharma-specific-characteristics means one's own dharma-specific-characteristics. Therefore the commentary states: "This, looking toward the establisher, contradicts self-dharma-specific-characteristics,

【Lower section】
therefore the contradictor is made according to other schools" (etc.). Committing faults looking toward Sāṃkhya's own school is called self-dharma-specific-characteristics. According to the previous explanation that the third and fourth causes all involve self-comparison contradicting self, the original establisher is taken as self.

The Commentary states: "If saying 'eyes etc. are definitely for self-use,' there is predicand-non-establishment. Lacking same-examples, aggregation-nature cause contradicts dharma-specific-characteristics, bedding-example has establishment-non-accomplishment" (text). If "self" were not divine self, why attach predicand-non-establishment? If "use" were not use-superior, how could there be establishment-non-accomplishment? Already looking toward the original syllogism's thesis, there is establishment-non-accomplishment. By analogy we know that for the contradicting thesis, it can be a positive example. Therefore it does not commit the fault of establishment-non-accomplishment.

Myōhon's record seems somewhat troublesome. Has [this commentary] now directly grasped the Commentary's purport? Kojima's imperial transmission completely lacks sophistication in this matter.

Inquiry: There is divine self-use meaning upon bedding implements. Even establishing "definitely for divine self-use," why is there establishment-non-accomplishment?

There are many meanings here. Now accomplishing one meaning: In the practice of establishing syllogisms, shared comparison-cause-examples must be extremely well-established. That there is divine self-use meaning upon bedding implements is the establisher's thesis-calculation. Since it is not commonly accepted, how can it serve as example? Because hypothetical-use meaning is accepted by both establisher and opponent, it becomes a shared positive example. Because it contradicts others and accords with oneself, though the predicand establishes self-use, same-examples must be shared. Therefore it does not take the meaning of divine self-use superior upon bedding implements. Commonly accepted hypothetical use, looking toward divine self-use thesis, is not a positive example, therefore

there is establishment-non-accomplishment.

The Bright Lamp Commentary should be examined.

○ Divine Self-Use Superior Mental Acceptance Thesis, Analogical Reasoning and Non-Dispute-Regarding
Transmission states: The tradition of non-dispute-regarding treatise-thesis is excellent. (As in the original commentary)

Previous opinion states: It is exclusively auxiliary analogical-reasoning thesis. (As in the Clear Text)

Further stating: Mental acceptance thesis, in the inclusion of four theses, is quite indefinite. If willing-to-establish and unwilling-to-establish are opposed, it is non-dispute-regarding treatise-thesis. Because it is the thesis the establisher genuinely desires to establish. If verbal expression and mental acceptance are opposed, it is auxiliary analogical-reasoning thesis. Making verbal expression's dharma-specific-characteristics the primary dispute, naming mental acceptance's latter three theses auxiliary disputes - this is the meaning. In all comparative syllogisms, what is primarily disputed against opponents is verbal expression dharma-thesis. Taking this as non-dispute-regarding treatise-thesis. What is disputed mentally, because it is not what words express, is called auxiliary analogical-reasoning. Stating it again: definite non-dispute-regarding treatise-thesis is predicand verbal expression. Definite analogical-reasoning thesis is impermanence-thesis auxiliarily accomplishing no-self thesis etc. Because no-self thesis is not verbal expression and also not primary willing-to-establish. Because mental acceptance thesis is willing-to-establish, it is not included in non-dispute-regarding treatise-thesis. Because it is not what words express, it is also included in analogical reasoning. Question: The Commentary states "Already in cause-faults explaining dharma-particulars etc." exclusively includes analogical reasoning, but does not show inclusion of non-dispute-regarding treatise-thesis. Answer: Wanting to explain the meaning of analogical reasoning being called thesis, it raises dharma-particular contradicted theses. Though mental acceptance thesis's two theses are indefinite, now discussing the gate of including analogical reasoning. Though no-self thesis's analogical reasoning is manifest, the meaning of being called thesis is hidden. Therefore now it is not

raised. The later text states "Therefore in theses there is auxiliary analogical reasoning, which is precisely the contradicted particulars of four contradictions" - this discusses auxiliary-primary through verbal expression and mental acceptance opposition.

Among repeated foolish opinions, has [this] now obtained true meaning? It should be kept secret, should be kept secret.

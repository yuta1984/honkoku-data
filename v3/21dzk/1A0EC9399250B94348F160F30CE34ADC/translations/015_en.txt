This transmission should be carefully examined in detail. It is most subtle.

Thirtieth interpretation: Among the three layers of separate-from-reality having-substance existence-nature, existence-nature substance definitely exists in qualified-subjects. The location of separate-from-reality having-substance meaning is indefinite. If following its substance, it exists at qualified-subject locations; if belonging to what accomplishes, it also exists in predicands. If existing in predicands, therefore mental acceptance penetrates two locations. If existing in qualified-subjects, the meaning that mental acceptance exists only in qualified-subjects is indefinite. Following these two gates, establishing dharma names is also indefinite. If mental acceptance differential meaning exists in qualified-subjects, because it regulates and produces understanding of things, it is directly called dharma. If belonging to predicands, because it is meaning accomplished by non-reality thesis-dharma, it obtains the dharma name. The Commentary depends on the former meaning, the Compendium depends on the latter gate. Master Matsumuro's transmission does not contradict this meaning.

Now I say: This meaning has profound significance. The Commentary states "They explain separate-from-reality having-substance existence-nature as thesis qualified-subjects" etc., making qualified-subject mental acceptance separate-from-reality existence-nature the established-dharma. Regarding this, taking "texts explaining equal-meaning categories with established-dharma as same-examples" as contradiction. In the answer this is reconciled. "Already making separate-from-reality existence-nature same-dharma, this too has equal established-dharma in the thesis, therefore this fault has no violation of logical principles." The origin of questions and answers makes qualified-subject mental acceptance the established-dharma, taking explanations of both treatises as contradictions to reconcile them. The Compendium's intention differs from this. "Saying 'non-reality etc.' means making the meaning of existing separate from reality etc. dharma; regarding this it immediately becomes what is established" - this makes the separate-from-reality having-substance meaning accomplished by non-reality predicands the established-dharma. The following text quotes both treatises as evidence. "Not looking to qualified-subjects to name same-different examples." Already using both treatises as evidence.

One should know this differs from Commentary explanations. Because the Commentary raises both treatises as violations. This meaning's intent is that added words have intricacies. If depending on Commentary intent, adding separate-from-reality words above qualified-subject existence-nature verbal expression. Speaking completely, one should say "separate-from-reality having-substance existence-nature." If depending on Compendium intent, adding existence-nature words above predicand non-reality words. One should completely say "non-reality having-substance existence-nature." Commentary and Compendium seem different but actually are one syllogism's latter-explained predicand. When manifesting establisher's original intent and completely establishing manifestation, one should establish thus. Using those complete words, looking comparatively at non-added-words syllogism dharma qualified-subject verbal expressions, qualified-subjects lack separate-from-reality meaning. Therefore adding words establishes separate-from-reality existence-nature. Predicands don't complete existence-nature substance. Therefore adding words establishes non-reality having-substance existence-nature. Combining both to see, it's just one perfectly reasoned expression. This is called added-words syllogism.

Question: Both Commentary and Compendium don't speak of added words. Why make two added words? Answer: Commentary's later text says "Reality only accomplishes dharma... Because it challenges their mental acceptance separate-from-reality etc. existing and having existence-nature, it only accomplishes dharma... Logic Gate looks to disputed qualified-subjects' above mental acceptance differential meaning" etc. Compiling this meaning says: "Logic Gate, for syllogism establishment, necessarily should add words, like establishing great-existence saying because it exists separate from reality etc. and is not existence-nature, it only accomplishes dharma." According to this, Commentary intent makes qualified-subject above differential meaning the established-dharma, immediately making it added words. The Compendium says "Saying non-reality etc.... doesn't look to qualified-subjects" etc. Asking "If so, why call it qualified-subject self-characteristic contradictory reason?" Answering "Looking to non-added words calls it qualified-subject self-characteristic; if words already added, immediately call it dharma." According to this question-answer, saying above

"Saying non-reality etc." explains predicand added-words meaning.

The above is what Master San collected. Thirty different theories of established-dharma are unprecedented in ancient times. Therefore I had them recorded. Among these there are many humble proposals. The similarities and differences between them should be investigated and distinguished later.

Generally, receiving birth in the final age and opening this wonderful text - if not for past good karma, how could one be thus? I definitely know in other lives I will necessarily hear this dharma. Quietly remembering the kindness of former sages, how can I achieve repayment and gratitude? Only with tears of rejoicing do I once sprinkle the writings of past persons.

I formerly studied thirty different theories as secret teachings, and after late learning, broadly examined ancient explanations and obtained several more different meanings. This compilation still lacks them. Also, I hear that the late Gakuanji Temple Abbot's exploratory difficult questions said: "Qualified-subject self-characteristic established-dharma has thirty different theories." Now examining, I fear this is not so. Though the thirty theories are subtle proposals, being exclusively among late learners' current proposals, I haven't heard former sages' transmissions. At great halls' gatherings, questioners' duties are not casual. Are they not things that should be praised? Also, the late Abbot Kakuen said: "The twenty-ninth meaning is recorded in clear texts. The thirtieth meaning is inappropriate." Also, someone said: "The fourteenth meaning has establishment in four theses, dharma is limited to predicands." Extremely laughable, laughable.

At the time of Jōwa 4th year, cool autumn 9th month, on the occasion of examination, I recorded this.

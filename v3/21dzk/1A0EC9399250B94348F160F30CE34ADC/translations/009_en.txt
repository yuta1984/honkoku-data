use-inferior. Saying "However, because hypothetical self requires placement and thus receives bed-seats, therefore regarding bedding implements, hypothetical other-use superior, real self-use inferior" clarifies that same-examples conversely become dissimilar cases. Saying "Now Dignāga immediately takes that cause and gives it to the superior-inferior particulars of established dharmas, thus making contradiction" concludes in dharma-particular contradiction. It is clearly known that the substance of two particulars is true-other and hypothetical-other. True and hypothetical are sequentially willing-to-establish and unwilling-to-establish. Willing and unwilling-to-establish are sequentially use-superior and use-inferior. If adding those words, one simply says superior-inferior. If pointing to their substance, it is simply true and hypothetical. The Victorious-Victorious school makes hypothetical-inferior follow true-superior, combining them as willing-to-establish. If so, what is the substance of the unwilling single particular? In Sāṃkhya doctrine, upon the qualified-subject eyes etc., there is no meaning of hypothetical self-use superior. If calling it "opponent's prior meaning," why does the Compilation Essentials say "both have commonly accepted hypothetical-other substitute places"? Not only the Compilation Essentials, but many contradictory texts exist. If saying that though not the qualified-subject's meaning, through the power of same-example bedding implements, under verbal expression it causes hypothetical use-superior meaning to exist, and this is not correctly taking same-examples, then things possessing meaning necessarily have substance. That substance is either qualified-subject or same-examples etc. If using same-examples to cause that meaning to exist, this is already the tradition of taking same-examples as single particulars. If saying that though its substance is same-examples, its meaning penetrates under the thesis, it still hasn't escaped the difficulty of having no separate substance. In making negatively characterized contradicting syllogisms, there are no substitute-place objects. Even saying "same-example bedding implements are substitute places," at that time again lacks same-examples. If saying "contradicting theses enable substitute places" - namely, the meaning of hypothetical self-other-use superior upon eyes etc. that Buddhist disciples establish - then the opponent's thesis substitute places would be appropriate. As the foundation of meaning, the thing capable of having those words is absent before the establisher.

Because it is absent, if the root is already emptily abandoned, what can the branches accomplish? It should be said that among true-superior and hypothetical-inferior before the establisher, accomplishing hypothetical rather than true, substitute places can accomplish, but laboring to seek other dharmas, none can be obtained. (Note: Kan'ō text reverse writing states: "Above is personal writing") Ancient (Note: Kan'ō text has the character "think" at sentence beginning) Toku-ichi's meaning takes those same-examples as single particulars. Now not directly using that meaning, but flattering its purport. Even though being meaning (Note: meaning - one text writes "thus"), it is not real common acceptance. Taking meaning without substance is what the Lamp school refutes. Moreover, hypothetical self-use inferior originally exists in the established thesis - why attribute this to willing-to-establish? Laboring to seek other meanings, erroneously entering different paths. Accessibility completely overturns, cannot be fully enumerated.

Three, Fault of Contradiction with Various Syllogisms
Regarding the comparison of various syllogisms raised, for the current syllogism it is not yet known who contradicts and who accords. The Two-Victorious school takes one thesis's acceptance as not contradictory. All attached various faults arise from this. If equally carried under verbal expression, then the particulars of various syllogisms all do not contradict. If because of contradicting-harming original intention, then this syllogism's two equals also accomplish contradiction. If like "making existing-conditioned-nature, making non-existing-conditioned-nature," their words contradict, then this syllogism differs from that because aggregated-non-aggregated, true-other hypothetical-other also greatly contradict - why is there no contradictory meaning? If not contradictory theses of establisher-opponent, then it can accomplish hypothetical-superior, can refute true-superior, eventually being establisher-opponent's contradiction. If discussing the first, making non-existing-conditioned-nature substance is either commonly accepted existence or reality-quality etc. Sages permit this, with verbal expression equally carried, existing side by side. Why call it contradiction? If those various syllogisms' unwillingness is also the opponent's thesis, then self-clinging to separate meanings is insufficient as proof.

Generally, this syllogism's two equals' mental acceptance both become meanings upon the qualified-subject eyes etc. The establisher's thesis-calculation is originally necessary. Moreover, Bodhisattva Dignāga's way of establishment-refutation is unobstructed in all directions. Upon commonly accepted hypothetical-other, merely placing the single character "superior," not losing the original thesis's hypothetical-other, also not contradicting Buddhism's fundamental principles. Yet it can accomplish refuting the establisher's willing-to-establish divine self-use superior. Questions and answers go back and forth, even bedrock is eventually crushed. The purport is most subtle. Who would not have doubts? If the same as ordinary examples, it conversely loses the profound purport. The five aggregates' combination hypothetically has activities, making totals as separate foundations, seemingly using eyes etc., with that capacity called reception-use superior. That superior is the meaning of capability. Not necessarily opposing separate divine self-use superior, through the power that same-example bedding implements etc.'s hypothetical use-superior is not true-superior, does the establisher conversely generate contradictory wisdom?

The Text "With Established Dharmas' Superior-Inferior Particulars" (Note: text - Kan'ō text writes "matter")
Now saying: superior-inferior particulars are the two equals' mental acceptance. In the established thesis, under dharma-specific-characteristics, there are true-superior hypothetical-inferior, willing-to-establish unwilling-to-establish particulars. "With" means "do." This is thus what is refuted. Making contradictor means contradicted-contradictor harmoniously accomplished. Taking unwilling thesis as capable-of-contradiction, causing contradicted true-superior thesis to accomplish contradiction. This all does the work of making dharma-contradictor, what is caused to be suffered. Therefore the treatise states: "Thus it also can establish particular contradiction of established dharmas: aggregation other-use." (text) The Commentary explains this text's stated meaning. The treatise originally, in willing-to-establish unwilling-to-establish two particulars, contradicts willing-to-establish to accomplish unwilling-to-establish, generally pointing to this contradicted-contradictor as the reason for contradictory procedures. But scholars one-sidedly doubt naming contradiction from the contradictor's single side. Though ordinary approaches are

thus, according to reality it establishes contradiction across both, therefore the Commentary's above text states: "Contradictory meaning means two theses mutually opposing" (text). Regarding this text's original intention: it is not dharma-specific-characteristics, nor do all particulars upon dharmas make contradiction (etc.). The other particulars it excludes are: contaminated-uncontaminated, permanent-impermanent, making that-conditioned-nature not-that-conditioned-nature etc., numerous meanings that can be distinguished regarding other-use. These are all not what is currently accomplished. Also either adding "only" characters or placing "intimate" characters etc. are all not what syllogistic establishment disputes. Only in the gate of true other-use superior hypothetical other-use inferior can this be discussed (meaning). Regarding explanatory original intention, first excluding other particulars. However, toward the word "with," the meaning of continuing textual flow cannot be absent. Therefore looking toward contradicted-contradictor, placing "cause to suffer." (Note: Kan'ō text writes "together cause to suffer this") Therefore the character "with" does not contradict (meaning).

Private opinions are not singular. Among these, are there particular difficulties with this meaning? The rest is like the Clear Text.

Sameness-Difference of Unwilling-to-Establish and Contradicting Thesis-Dharmas
Inquiring: In various syllogisms' procedures, unwilling-to-establish mental acceptance and contradicting theses have no difference in their words. Making non-existing-conditioned-nature, and definitely separate from eye-consciousness form etc. Why does the current syllogism have differences?

Now saying: Unwilling-to-establish and contradicting theses have sameness-difference in substance. If their substance is the same, necessarily change those words. Like the necessarily-for-others-use syllogism. If substance differs, do not change those words. Making non-existing-conditioned-nature etc. is this. If substance is same but words not changed, then the establisher's prior two particulars mutually exist from the beginning. Even establishing unwilling thesis, why would willing-to-establish thesis cease? Because there is no contradiction. Also establisher-opponent thesis-meanings should have no differences. Making non-existing-conditioned-nature, when establishing-taking in contradictor, is immediately real

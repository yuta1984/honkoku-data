Also according to Kojima. Question: Why is the combination category not made a positive example of the original inference? Answer: Because there is no meaning of existence-nature separate from substance etc. Kojima says "there is no separate essence apart from what is combined."
Question: If so, why can the reason "because it is non-absent" be obtained and applied? Answer: Because it is not completely absent. Question: If so, how is it made non-intended? Non-intended means carrying explicit statement under "existence-nature separate from substance etc.," but if combination categories have no meaning of "existence-nature separate from substance etc.," it is difficult to carry the statement. Answer: The above text says "combination categories have separate nature apart from substance etc." Question: If so, why not make it a positive example of the original inference again? Answer:

○On the generation of opponent's evidential cognition from self-inference
Even when the opponent does not accept the establisher's proposed doctrine, when constructing the three members using one's own accepted doctrine, the opponent also enters that doctrinal position and examines those three members. If the establisher can establish the three members within their own school, it is not impossible for the opponent to generate decisive cognition. However, because it is not doctrine accepted by the opponent's own school, it is not true decisive cognition. Question: If so, what benefit is there in establishing self-inference? Answer: First establishing self-inference using one's own accepted doctrine, first making one believe the proposed thesis, then when establishing one's accepted doctrine through separate reasoning, when the opponent believes that doctrine, they return to the previously established inference and generate true decisive cognition. For example, this is like citing Mahayana sutras to prove the eighth consciousness. At this time, the Hinayana temporarily accepts the eighth consciousness following what is taught, but because they do not generally believe that Mahayana sutras are Buddha's teaching, the text explaining the eighth consciousness is not sacred teaching and does not become definitive proof. After establishing that Maha-

yana sutras are Buddha's teaching through the seven reasons etc., one can generate faith and understanding regarding the eighth consciousness taught therein. This meaning is reasonable.
Question: When establishing other-inference, does the establisher generate self-awakening cognition? Answer: Because one generates understanding by entering another's doctrine, self-awakening cognition is also generated, though not like shared and self [inference].

Dignāga Bodhisattva is one Buddha of the Bhadrakalpa. His propagation at Maitreya's logic treatise is already weighty. Who among those hoping for Tuṣita Heaven and awaiting descent would not form connections? Here, various masters' establishing different theories is extremely numerous, making it difficult to connect the beginning and end of one doctrine. The passability of the correct path is easily confused. One must look up to masters' teachings and not act freely. However, there is no great virtue of an age without transmission. Yet still repeatedly contemplating thoroughly, one need not necessarily maintain that position. As for me, I rely entirely on Master Kojima's teachings. Though time is distant and the lineage severed, where the aspiration goes, there is no second guidance. This is because I deeply consider conditions for future guidance. Therefore, regarding ordinary terminology, I have roughly added embellishment according to that fundamental intent. Within this, the earlier and later compositions are not without discrepancies. One should still consider the refined intention. In my past when I somewhat attended the study window, being plainly fed beyond others, and after permanently taking up quiet dwelling, my core was greatly reformed. Logic matters are entirely beyond my portion, but when old acquaintances occasionally visit, through discussion we naturally touch on doctrinal matters. If dark speculation exists in the chest and one speaks following the mouth, speaking and leaving, leaving and forgetting, it is almost like traces of sky birds. This autumn I added some review, but with old eyes and sick strength unable to bear self-recording, I commissioned Master San to compile the old and new, totaling eighteen volumes divided

into two parts. The first thirteen volumes are titled "Myōhonshō," extensively recording transmitted fundamental doctrines, earlier and later personal views, and various self-other doctrines. The latter five volumes are named "Myōyōshō," annotating side discussions, separate investigations, similar doctrines, embellishments etc.—the remnants and omissions of Myōhon. Many omissions still remain; what is worth regretting? At the time, winter of Kenryaku Mizunoe-Saru year, eleventh month, first day, I finished this work at Kaijūzan Rōshuku-bō.

　　This commentary is the inner treasure of logic, the source of establishment and refutation. Who among those carrying the Way would not joyfully seek it? However, those of sparse learning and shallow position do not hear even its name. Here, the two Dharma Seals of former masters《Jōhan and Jitkan》both became pillars of one school and equally became peerless in the two clarities. Each carried this book as secret instruction. When I constantly followed Dharma Seal Jitkan from the beginning of my studies, receiving transmission of the great meaning of the two clarities, regarding these important books requiring transmission, when that Dharma Seal left the Ichijōin family, while I was still an attendant, unexpectedly stopping correspondence, both our intentions were concluded. Afterward, relying on Chikurin-in Dharma Seal《Jōhan》for two or three years, sometimes reading the Great Commentary and two-volume private notes, sometimes collating Myōhonshō without including others. Thus continuously transmitting and learning the profound meaning of logic. When in Kōan 7th year, around 9th month, when the superior lay on his sickbed, I expressed a slight hope to see this book once. He replied: "The aspiration for seeking dharma is especially keen. The master-disciple relationship runs deep. Beyond that, though not a matter of stinginess, your age is still young and there is hesitation about proofreading. Therefore I place this book with Ichijōin Bishop's quarters. If you reach exploratory rank, you may be permitted to see it once"—thus it was stated《and so forth》. Afterward he passed away shortly, and grief was hard to cease. Thereupon, in the 8th year, 10th month, 1st day, receiving the exploratory appointment, I explained the details to Ichijōin Bishop's

quarters, and following the previously stated intent, without objection, it was lent. Thus, following the sequence of viewing the complete five volumes once, I spoke with someone and had them write it out. Alas! Though my days of devoted study are shallow and I hesitate to assume the heavy responsibility of exploratory position, when the time for historical study arrived, I finally rejoiced in seeing the secrets in my palm. This is indeed the miraculous response of the avatar's invisible assistance and the inherited virtue of my predecessor's guidance. Tears of gratitude cannot be suppressed; joy overflows my body.

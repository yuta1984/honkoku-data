That's it. If it were not the latter level, this syllogism's dispute would be barely limited to the meaning of separate-from-reality having-substance and end. By what power would qualified-subjects be accomplished? This is merely a self-comparison syllogism that, having accomplished one level through the predicands of existence and non-existence, faintly transmits to make qualified-subjects known. Deceptive establishment syllogisms transcend that. Through the power of reasons and examples, they directly want to accomplish qualified-subjects at the place of dharma. 《The above was retained.》

　○The Meaning of "What is Established is Precisely Dharma" Commentary
"What is established" corresponds to "what is accomplished" in terms of specific-general. Whether establishing dharma or establishing qualified-subjects, what the establisher enjoys and wants to establish all obtains the name "what is established." That which is established necessarily becomes dharma to accomplish it. Therefore it's called "established dharma." "What is established means thesis, dharma means predicand"—this is that meaning. Question: If so, why say "dharma within the total thesis"? Answer: Speaking of "within" uses "total thesis" in opposition to "particular thesis." The meaning is that among two approaches, now taking this approach is called "within." It's not that there are further two parts within the total thesis. When maintaining this commentary, what is established is precisely dharma. And in syllogisms accomplishing dharma, what is established actually belongs to predicands, so this meaning is clear. If what is established in syllogisms accomplishing qualified-subjects, though it is qualified-subjects, using those qualified-subjects, it's still named "established dharma." Making skillful means the meaning, accomplishing it to show it is dharma. This approach obtains the name "established dharma." Question: If relying on predicands to establish dharma-name, how while placing qualified-subjects can it still be named "established dharma"? Answer: Previously disputing at the place of dharma, "established dharma" has been established. Though there are what-is-qualified, it's still named dharma. If seeing what-is-qualified, it's also named qualified-subjects.

　○Qualified-Subject Distinction Methods
First: In the existence-nature non-reality syllogism, under the qualified-subject existence-nature, there's a mental acceptance syllogism making existence-nature into creative-causation-nature. In that mental acceptance syllogism, under the creative-causation-nature predicand, it carries the two distinctions of creating-great-existence and creating-non-great-existence. Looking toward the thesis of mentally accepting pleasure in becoming creative-great-existence-causation-nature, through same-examples of identity-difference-nature, examining and accomplishing different categories. This attaches the error of qualified-subject distinction contradiction.

Second: There's no mental acceptance syllogism. Only under existence-nature, there's creative-causation-nature mental acceptance. Under that mental acceptance, creating-great-existence creating-non-great-existence mental acceptance is additionally placed.
Third: Under qualified-subject existence-nature, directly carrying creating-existence creating-non-existence mental acceptance. 《People on the right mostly use this meaning》
Fourth: The meaning of double-level single-level is indefinite. The establisher places creative-causation-nature mental acceptance under qualified-subject existence-nature. That is, directly raising creative-great-existence-causation, but since creative-causation-nature meaning naturally extends to creating-non-existence distinction, that meaning extends to reach double-level. Discussing mental acceptance substance, it's only single-level. Because words penetrate, it becomes double-level.
　　Above: Original method
Fifth: Using the separate syllogism of existence-nature creative-causation-nature as the current method. Under predicands, mentally accepting creative-great-existence-causation-nature, finally attaching to qualified-subjects. Therefore it becomes qualified-subject self-characteristic contradiction.
Sixth: In separate method schools, mental acceptance still lies in qualified-subjects.
Seventh: Mental acceptance lies in both places, among which having it in qualified-subjects is primary.
Eighth: Having it in predicands is primary.
　　Above: Separate method.
Ninth: Using both methods together. 《Ancient people established this meaning, taking Ninkaku's etc. transmissions as models. Can be examined and seen.》
Tenth: The treatise uses the original method, commentary-judgments take the separate method. 《Dandō transmission》
　Now saying: The original method's double-level mental acceptance meaning is inherited transmission. However, the indefinite meaning of single-level double-level

　is good. Among the separate method's many meanings, mental acceptance being in two places with qualified-subjects as primary perhaps corresponds to Kojima's original intention. Only through Dandō transmission can textual principle be obtained. Sanku's Lotus Assembly vertical reasoning made this meaning be established. The general purport of various meanings is like the Clear Original Record.
　Original Method Meaning
Question: Through non-reality words, it's difficult to see creative-causation-nature mental acceptance.
Now saying: This has many meanings. First: Through these predicand words, seeking and seeing pleasure-making mental acceptance is the principle established by separate method schools. Original method meaning differs from this. Only through the establisher's thesis-calculations, inferentially knowing mental acceptance under dharma and qualified-subject words. If necessarily through predicand words, exploring and obtaining mental acceptance under qualified-subjects, when outsiders establish syllogisms against Buddhist dharma saying: "Self-self is permanent, without beginning-end, like great empty space" 《etc.》 under the qualified-subject "self" words, examining the distinctions between self that follows body creating karma receiving pleasure-pain and self that doesn't follow body creating karma receiving pleasure-pain. How could one know that distinction through permanent predicand words? Also, in syllogisms that self grasped by self-attachment should not be one, examining false-self real-self distinctions is also thus. According to this, in existence-nature non-reality syllogisms, directly under qualified-subject existence-nature, examining creating-existence creating-non-existence mental acceptance—what violation would there be?
Second: Through non-reality words it's sought and known. Because non-reality words carry creative-causation-nature meaning, they accomplish creative-great-existence-causation-nature mental acceptance under qualified-subjects. Therefore Kojima, relying on original method meaning, commenting on the text "Sāṃkhya's this reason already accomplishes existence-nature obstructing non-reality etc. becoming creative-causation-nature" says: First, qualified-subject self-

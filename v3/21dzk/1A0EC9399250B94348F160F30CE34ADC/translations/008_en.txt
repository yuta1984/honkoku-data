This does not criticize the treatise master. (Above) Now inferring this meaning: that the Buddhist logic of the Śataśāstra and Yogācāra differs from the Nyāyamukha and *Pramāṇasamuccaya is according to the purport of inherited teaching (oral transmission from Superior Sai'on). Following this, the Śataśāstra distinguishes in detail the cause "because this is impermanent," which is not the method of Yulong, Tianshi, etc. The treatise master preserves details and actually distinguishes causes.

Here when the Compilation master says "also should not distinguish," he permits the treatise master's detailed distinction while examining the original intention of Nyāyamukha and *Pramāṇasamuccaya outside the treatise, saying "do not distinguish." The dharma of causes and examples does not distinguish, establishing inference based on general dharmas because this is the main principle of Buddhist logic. Therefore this cause also should not be distinguished (meaning).

This meaning is the same as what Dharma Master Sanko examined. Subtle, subtle. It truly grasps Master Shimizu's original intention. This foolish old one has permanently taken refuge in this tradition.

○ The Main Principles of the Two Schools of Victorious-Victorious and Victorious-Inferior
The Victorious-Inferior tradition takes the establisher's original intention as the ultimate principle and Cien's various explanations as ultimate textual proof. The true method of various particular-characteristic contradictions ○ is not like the Lamp's explanations. (There are no separate dharmas and seven contradictions) Where difficult situations become stuck is the single matter that the contradicting thesis exists outside "unwilling-to-establish."

The Victorious-Victorious tradition takes contradictory meaning as fundamental, depending on contradicting theses to accomplish "unwilling-to-establish" as the ultimate principle. Viewing from this perspective, all texts serve as evidence. That there is no "unwilling-to-establish" before the establisher is what eventually becomes an obstruction. From this enters separate resonance, taking the opponent's prior meaning as "unwilling-to-establish," with contradictions being manifold.

Even wanting to accomplish this through same-example immediate meaning etc., the fundamental principle is quite weak. The so-called two particulars immediately becoming contradicted-contradictor has this meaning lost emptily.

The Two-Other-Use tradition puts the establisher's original intention first, greatly obtaining principle. But when making contradicting procedures, because it uses the word "victorious," those who observe conversely think that mental acceptance should originally place words like "victorious."

Question: Regarding the two schools of Victorious-Victorious and Victorious-Inferior, in examining various syllogisms, what meanings still accord? Now what is called Victorious-Victorious meaning makes its purport easy to grasp through this. It is said to accord with various syllogisms, but I fear it is still sparse. Examining with Cien's explanations as definitive measure, does Victorious-Inferior meaning also accord with various syllogisms? But the appearance of various syllogisms differs variously, making success and failure difficult for beginning students to determine easily. If not distinguishing the accessibility of different approaches, wouldn't eliminating faults be extremely difficult?

Question: What meaning does the Commentary's text on "superior-inferior particulars with established dharmas" accord with? Answer: In Victorious-Victorious meaning, if willing-to-establish encompasses both, it seems to skillfully grasp the text. But it still loses the main principle of particular-characteristic contradiction. Taking superior-inferior words as immediate superior-inferior proof, though seemingly shallow and近, is conversely fundamental. Treatise-Commentary-Decision-Compilation has only this text. All others are circuitous. Giving straightforward text versus circuitous proof, superiority-inferiority can be known. What is constrained is merely between one word, with explanations not being singular. Seeing the text's original intention, there is completely no contradiction.

Question: Using "hypothetical other-use superior" to say it is neither willing-to-establish nor unwilling-to-establish - although explained, hasn't it failed to escape the difficulty of non-constraint in Victorious-Victorious meaning? Answer: Correct. This matter is not one difficult meaning within current syllogisms but the profound foundation of establishment-refutation. The latter three contradictions, what has been disputed since ancient times, are all this type. Bhāviveka's

syllogism, Jinaputra's syllogism, Yogācāra syllogisms, etc. each have different styles. Generally difficult to exhaust in words, through these meanings one must know the essential nature of the Way. Do not find other ordinary matters strange in their profound purports.

(Note: The Kan'ō text's reverse writing states: "The following is perhaps personal writing, etc. Some texts have these words")

The annotations criticize superior-inferior particulars by attaching three faults. Now regarding Victorious-Victorious meaning, conversely attaching three faults:

1. Fault of Particular Non-establishment
Particulars are separate meanings carried upon particular-characteristics. The two clarifications of particular-universal, though having multiple levels, are not without essential meaning. But if hypothetical other-use superior is not the establisher's meaning, already differing from general universal-characteristic meanings, mutually not penetrating - how can this be called particular? If saying that though mental acceptance, it penetrates verbal expression and is therefore called universal-characteristic, then Vaiśeṣika syllogisms' "separate from substance, greatly existing" also has existence-nature meaning penetrating verbal expression, so should be called particular. Why is it termed particular-characteristic? If saying Vaiśeṣika doctrine has no two existence-natures, then Sāṃkhya doctrine also has no two other-use superiors. How is this called particular? If saying it combines establisher-opponent meanings to form two particulars, then master-disciple's two existences should appropriately become two equals. If saying this syllogism's same-example hypothetical other-use superior penetrates mental acceptance and therefore does not resemble the existence-nature syllogism, then the Yogācāra syllogism's "definitely separate from form" has no penetration to same-examples. How does this become particular? Investigating and examining thus, corresponding examples cannot be escaped.

Adding to this, the Two-Victorious school takes particular meaning as immediately called contradiction. The two meanings are confused. Though profoundly superior-inferior, the particular's name and meaning are as already stated above. Speaking of contradiction: through cause-example power,

【Lower section】
when making contradictor, contradicting and harming the original thesis, it first gains that name. Before making contradicting syllogisms, though called particular, it is not termed contradiction. But making what can eventually become contradicting thesis firmly cause contradiction when in mind - this fears being incorrect principle. Two universals upon one particular-characteristic, though having meaning-particulars, are not like water and fire. By what is one thesis's acceptance called particular non-establishment?

2. Fault of Text-Meaning Non-accordance
Superior-inferior words have authentic text in the Commentary. Two-superior explanations completely lack clear evidence. Abandoning what exists to take what doesn't exist is extreme non-accordance. The Commentary states: "In this meaning-explanation, if Sāṃkhya heretics oppose Buddhist disciples, intending to establish I as receiver, receiving-using eyes etc." (text). The syllogism's original intention has no such text. Already taking divine self as willing-to-establish thesis, all other meanings are unwilling-to-establish. Moreover, hypothetical self's reception-use is what opponents and witnesses all permit - accomplishing this serves what purpose? The *Sāṃkhyasaptati states: "Aggregation is for others, differs from depending on three poisons, because the eater is separately alone, five causes establish the existence of self" (text). The current aggregated-nature cause with necessary other-use thesis is the meaning of aggregation-for-others. In forced establishment procedures, though verbal expression is common, the establisher's original intention has completely no different paths. Therefore the treatise states: "Thus it also can establish particular contradiction of established dharmas: aggregation other-use" (text). Two particulars eventually divide into contradicted-contradictor; we can know this is simply true-other and hypothetical-other. The Commentary text states: "However, the non-aggregated-other of eye-organs etc., real self-use superior-use intimately using this to receive the five unique-objects" means willing-to-establish divine self-use superior. Saying "because depending on eyes etc. one establishes hypothetical self, therefore aggregated self using eyes etc. is inferior" means unwilling-to-establish hypothetical self

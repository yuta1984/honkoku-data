because other minds arise in between and cause this interruption. "Liberation path" means: after the uninterrupted path, realizing the attainment of freedom from bondage and being able to abandon gross burdens is called the liberation path. Speaking of "gross burdens" refers to the non-capability nature of categories to be eliminated, not the essence of obstacles. "Advancement path" means: regarding the various existing paths after liberation, in relation to this advancement they are called advancement paths. However, advancement paths have two types: first, general; second, specific. Specific advancement paths are singular and not included in subsequent categories' preparatory [paths], etc., but separately cultivate other paths. Or generate contentment, dwell in negligence, etc. Though not advancement categories, if they arise after liberation they are also called advancement. General advancement paths are precisely the preparatory paths, etc. within subsequent categories. If viewed in relation to previous categories, they are called advancement paths, because they arise after liberation and advance to other categories. The present chapter master's intention relies on general advancement, therefore saying "further cultivating other paths." The doctrine of these four paths is as extensively explained in the *Yogācāra*, *Abhidharma Compendium*, *Disclosure* treatises, etc. "These four all apply to contaminated and uncontaminated, etc." means: when relying on contaminated concentration to suppress delusions, they also complete the four paths. Therefore it says "these four all apply to contaminated and uncontaminated."

"From 'What paths can eliminate' to 'sometimes separate, sometimes general'": Below, based on the four paths, it explains paths that can eliminate. First clarifying uncontaminated elimination paths, then clarifying contaminated elimination paths. This first clarifies uncontaminated elimination paths. "The two vehicles have dull faculties, etc." - if following the treatise's intention, it clarifies the similarities and differences among the three vehicles' four paths. Now focusing on the two vehicles, it clarifies elimination paths, not raising bodhisattvas. This text's meaning explains thus: Because the two vehicles have dull faculties and weak path-power, uninterrupted and liberation [paths] must necessarily be separate for each category. The liberation of previous categories does not become uninterrupted in relation to subsequent [categories], because they cannot eliminate the delusions of those subsequent categories. Also, subsequent uninterrupted [paths] do not

become liberation in relation to previous [categories], because when liberation paths arise, they cannot realize that cessation. Therefore the two paths are separate for each category. If preparatory and advancement [paths] do not correctly eliminate and realize, whether separate or general, all are acceptable. "Sometimes separate" means: beyond this category's advancement, separately arising subsequent preparatory [paths]. "Sometimes general" means: precisely making subsequent categories' preparatory [paths] into previous categories' advancement paths. Preparatory [paths] are called general or separate only in relation to advancement. Advancement is also called general or separate in relation to uninterrupted and liberation.

"From 'This text's meaning explains' to 'therefore arising separately'": "Preparatory approaches elimination, etc." - among the four paths, preparatory and advancement do not eliminate afflictions, therefore cannot be elimination paths. Uninterrupted eliminates the essence of delusions, liberation removes gross burdens, therefore these two are taken as elimination paths. "Cannot arise as the separate characteristics of these two paths" - speaking of "two paths": some texts say "two paths," some texts say "three paths," both without contradiction. If three paths, it explains regarding the uninterrupted path that eliminates the second category. When arising this second category's uninterrupted path, it cannot be liberation in relation to the first category, uninterrupted in relation to the second category, and preparatory in relation to the third category. If two paths, it is like arising the uninterrupted path to eliminate one category and then immediately arising the second moment's liberation. This second moment's liberation does not become an uninterrupted path in relation to the second category. That second category necessarily arises separate uninterrupted and liberation [paths] because faculties are dull. Up to the nine categories are also thus. Both sequential and transcendent are so. Because there are those who can gradually eliminate nine categories, preparatory and advancement arise separately. If within one contemplation, following however many categories are eliminated, then generally one preparatory and one subsequent

advancement, therefore making preparatory and advancement sometimes general, sometimes separate is easy. If gradually eliminating nine categories requires emerging from contemplation, if not emerging from contemplation to eliminate nine categories, then uninterrupted and liberation necessarily arising separately is difficult. This explains the cultivation path, not that such matters exist in the path of seeing. Because their faculties are dull, when realizing the unconditioned, they cannot accommodate eliminating delusions. Even if previously using worldly paths to suppress [them], when later entering seeing, though also generally treating [them] as one category and eliminating together with seeing, they do not constitute separate paths. There is a separate diagram of the two vehicles' four paths, as in the diagram on the left. Its meaning can be understood. The two vehicles' sequential four paths. The nine ○s above in the diagram are categories to be treated. The twenty ○s below are precisely paths that can treat.

○First moment path: In relation to all nine categories, all become preparatory. No other path functions.
○Second moment path: In relation to the first category, becomes uninterrupted path. Only one path exists. Separately arising uninterrupted.
○Third moment path: In relation to the first category, becomes liberation path. Should be understood according to the previous.
[Following sixteen lines blank]
○Twentieth moment path: In relation to all nine categories, becomes advancement path. No other path functions.

"From 'Fascicle nine says' to 'two kinds of paths'": This proves that the two vehicles should arise uninterrupted and liberation for each category. Therefore "uninterrupted and liberation all become elimination paths" below is the chapter master's text. "Because the aspirational minds for eliminating delusions and realizing cessation are separate, etc." - if following the treatise's intention, this addresses Hīnayāna objections. Hīnayāna objects saying: In completing the uninterrupted path, if there are still delusion-attainments, liberation paths can arise to contradict attainments. Now your uninterrupted path already lacks delusion-seeds. What use is there in again arising liberation paths? What would using them accomplish? Therefore the treatise master responds: Because previous preparatory aspirational minds are separate. Namely, uninterrupted paths can eliminate delusions, liberation paths can realize cessation. Though the uninterrupted path already lacks delusion-seeds, realizing that unconditioned has this functional difference, [therefore] arising liberation paths. This is one explanation. "In order to abandon that category's gross burden nature" - this is the second explanation. Gross burden nature is precisely the non-capability nature of the two obstacles' seeds. Though the uninterrupted path lacks delusion-seeds, it has not yet abandoned that non-capability nature. In order to abandon this, liberation paths arise.

"From 'If contaminated six' to 'liberation not separate'": From here onward reveals contaminated elimination paths. Within the Sarvāstivāda school there are two explanations. First: If suffering is the uninterrupted path, tranquility is the liberation path. Up to: obstruction is uninterrupted, separation is liberation. One authoritative position says: Any one of the three as uninterrupted path, any one of the three as liberation path. In present Mahāyāna it agrees with the authoritative explanation. Therefore it says "any one of the three - suffering, coarse, obstruction

When seeds have the capacity to produce effects, at that time they definitely are able to follow those derived form seeds and also produce their own effects. Hence it is explained that derived forms are produced by great elements" (above is treatise text). The text differs but the meaning is the same. Hence saying "explaining this same [principle]."

From "Now one should ask" to "provisionally explaining great element production": The meaning of this question is asking about being in one place and encompassing that meaning, then being named "production." Only co-substantial various forms should have great element production. Non-manifest forms, etc., already being separate from great elements, how can [we] speak of production? This is the question's meaning. "Following those traversed, etc." is the answer. Speaking of "traversed" means the manifested bodily and verbal [actions] are what thought traverses, hence named "traversed." Hence commentary volume 2 says: "The third thought, for the first two thoughts, is what is traversed, hence naming it the path. This is the meaning of object and what is elicited. Like bodily and verbal [actions] being what thought traverses, etc." (above is commentary text). Speaking of "prevented" means bodily and verbal misdeeds are what ethical wholesome [actions] prevent, hence named "prevented." Scattered non-manifest forms, following those traversed bodily-verbal [actions] and the great elements possessed by prevented misdeeds, then obtain production. This is only remote production, not intimate production meaning. Hence saying "provisionally explaining great element production." Question: Great elements have three types - namely resultant, nourishing, and accordant-with-type. In producing non-manifest forms, which great [elements] among the three? Explanation: Master Fan says: If [they are] concentration-path precepts, regarding concentration-path corresponding thought, prevented bodily-verbal [actions] provisionally establish the meaning of non-manifestation as bodily-verbal discipline. [There is] no separate form essence. Therefore [we] do not speak of great element production. If [one] can elicit wholesome bodily-verbal manifestation, [this is] called concentration-path discipline and can also be named accordant-with-type nourishing great element production. If through thought's power [one] elicits resultant bodily-verbal [actions] having movement and expression, then these bodily-verbal [actions are] resultant great element production. Individual liberation

discipline bodily-verbal [actions] are also the same as this explanation. Now the chapter compiler's meaning only follows traversed and prevented [actions], explaining the reason why these three types provisionally speak of great element production. "Definitely same place, etc." means generally production has two [types]: first, intimate production, like co-substantial production, etc.; second, remote production, like separate-substantial production, etc. Now saying "definitely same place" refers to intimate production. This is necessarily real production, not provisional. Necessarily same-nature production, not different nature. Necessarily same-type production, not different type. Contaminated and uncontaminated necessarily have the same type. Necessarily same-realm production, not different realm. Concentration and scattered [states] are necessarily the same, not different productive [causes]. Regarding time, [it is] also thus. Necessarily same-time production, not different-time production. Saying "necessarily provisionally dependent" refers to remote production. If provisional production, [it involves] remote mutual dependence production. Correspondingly without obstruction. The three types of resultant, nourishing, and accordant-with-type may each intimately produce or may alternately produce - principle also does not obstruct. Master Fan says: If remotely mutually dependent, all various forms are all produced from great [elements]. If compared to same-place non-separation, then separated wheel-light, mind-object realm forms, and image forms of the five-six consciousnesses are all not great element production - the meaning is the same as this. Generally manifesting the text's meaning: productive and produced mutually do not separate, existing in mutual dependence. This is precisely production meaning. However, individual liberation precepts, etc., already being separate from great elements, based on what [do we] speak of production? Hence now reconciling, saying: non-separation meaning has two [types]: first, because of same place, named non-separation; second, because of provisional dependence, named non-separation. Individual liberation precepts, etc., regarding the second provisional dependence non-separation meaning, provisionally speak of great element production. Separate-substantial sounds and light are all also like this.

From "*Yogācārabhūmi* 50" to "should be fully expounded": The intention of citing this text is to prove that concentration-effect

forms, etc., based on the second provisional dependence non-separation meaning, provisionally speak of great element production. Here "superior concentration-effect forms only depend on superior concentration, not on great elements" clarifies there are no same-place mutually dependent intimate production great elements. However "from conditioning those type-images, etc." means then obtaining remote mutual provisional dependence remote production meaning. Hence [*Yogācārabhūmi*] 66 says: "If that concentrated mind contemplates desire realm material dharmas and images arise, [one] should say [they are] produced by desire realm great elements. If that concentrated mind contemplates form realm material dharmas and images arise, [one] should say [they are] produced by form realm great elements" (above is treatise text). This explains that through remote mutual provisional dependence, [one] can also speak of production. In reality, [it] also does not speak of same-place non-separation as productive. However *Yogācārabhūmi* 54's text has upper and lower contradictions. The upper text says: "Due to superior concentration power, first arising great elements, then derived forms transform and arise." Also the lower text says: "Superior concentration-effect forms only depend on superior concentration, not on great elements, etc." How [do they] contradict? Explanation: Master Ji's *Yogācārabhūmi* commentary has two explanations there. First explanation: "Not depending on great elements, etc." - if regarding same moment, like lower realm sense organs, etc., great element production meaning, initially having great elements then having derived forms, [this is] named not depending on great elements. If derived forms also depend on samādhi, because of previous moment type great elements, [they] can also be named produced by four great [elements]. If not concentration, etc. forms, great [elements] and derived forms necessarily simultaneously produce. Those concentration great elements produce at different times. The upper text saying "first arising great elements" means previous moments transform into great elements, later moments then become derived forms. [It] is not simultaneous moment production. Because depending on that for arising, [it is] named production, hence this is great element production meaning. Second explanation: The upper text's "first arising great elements" is based on concentration-

effect real forms. Therefore in concentration [they] transform into great elements. However the lower text saying "not depending on great elements" is based on provisional concentration forms. Because [they] must depend on real great [elements] for arising. [We] take concentration-prior samādhi type-image forms' great element production. The rest is as explained there. Now [we] preserve the first explanation. Master Fan says: "Not depending on great elements, etc." means not really using the four great [elements] in the tangible realm for production. Hence saying "depending on superior concentration, not depending on great elements." The upper text saying "first arising great elements, etc." refers to first manifesting great characteristics resembling tangible objects in concentration, then like manifesting form characteristics, [we] can also speak of these manifested great characteristics as productive. In reality, these manifested great characteristics are merely apparent visible forms that are objects of consciousness, merely resembling tangible great [elements], hence named great [elements]. Extensively as explained in that master's *Abhidharmasamuccaya* commentary. This meaning's extensive explanation is as explained in the mind-object realm forms chapter below.

From "Or again the five causes" to "therefore causes": "The five causes do not pervade everything" means the five causes of arising, etc. are all included in predominant [conditions]. Either possessing the five meanings or not possessing five - [it is] not definitely necessary to possess [them]. If co-substantial production, [they] necessarily possess the five causes. If separate-substantial production, [they] do not necessarily possess five. Like separated wheel-light, etc., because [they] are separate from great elements. Speaking of "dependency cause" - some say [this] does not mean the dependency cause meaning among the five. Productive great elements, regarding derived forms, are generally named "dependent." This is dependency meaning. [We] name this "cause." Dependent being cause, hence named "dependency cause." How can [we] know? Master Ji's *Yogācārabhūmi* commentary volume 2 says: "Various sunlight, isolated incense, etc., because [they] are separate from great elements, already saying separate from great elements, clearly knowing [this is] not only the dependency cause meaning among the five." Now this textual appearance seems to explain dependency cause. Examining the *Yogācārabhūmi* commentary text, [this] is not necessarily so. Hence the *Yogācārabhūmi* commentary says: "Either possessing the five meanings or not possessing five - [it is] not definitely necessary to possess [them]." As above

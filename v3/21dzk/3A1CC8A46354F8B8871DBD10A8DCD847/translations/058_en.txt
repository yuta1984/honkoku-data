[One] attains the fruit of dharma-emptiness wisdom. From the first ground and above, [one] subdues dharma-attachment, etc., and attains dharma-emptiness wisdom. Another explanation says: "Attaining fruit" meaning Buddha fruit is incorrect. How could one attain Buddha fruit by subduing obstacles? Question: Among the twenty-seven noble ones, [those who] subdue concentration obstacles in the causal stage are called "bodily witness." Why doesn't subduing afflictions in the causal stage get called "wisdom-liberation"? Explanation: Wisdom-liberation is manifested in relation to permanent elimination. Within concentration obstacles, [one] doesn't distinguish between elimination and subduing - both attain superior concentration. Even just subduing to attain concentration is also called "attaining liberation." Master Fan and others made this explanation. "Regarding liberation stages, all as in constant explanations": That is, within the stage of conditions conducive to liberation, the meanings of the three vehicles subduing obstacles and attaining concentration, etc., are all as commonly explained. Now briefly marking the beginning, [the text] also doesn't raise the decisive selection stage. In principle, [it] should also be marked. Hence Master Ji said: In the Sarvāstivāda school, before the seeing path, the seven expedient paths do not eliminate afflictions. In the Satyasiddhi school, before the seeing path, the five expedient paths only eliminate afflictions. [This is] extensively [explained] as in that chapter. If following the Mahāyāna, the two stages of provisions and preparation can subdue obstacles. These various meanings are as explained in the *Vijñānavāda* treatise, etc.

"Two-three obstacle divisions... *Vijñānavāda* chapter explanation": Regarding skin-flesh-complete: Depending on the *Yogācāra* treatise, regarding cognitive obstacles, these three names are established. Hence [volume] forty-eight says: "Know that all cognitive obstacle categories' existing heavy [karmic residues] also have three types: first, residing in skin... third, residing in substantial heavy [residues]." Explanation: Following the treatise's explanation, what the first ground eliminates is called skin, what the eighth ground eliminates is called flesh, what the Tathāgata eliminates is called substantial. Regarding the coarse-subtle distinctions of cognitive obstacles, these three names are established. Question: Cognitive obstacles are all eliminated in the ten grounds. Why explain elimination depending on three abodes?

【Lower Section】
Explanation: The first ground first realizes principle, the eighth ground first attains effortlessness, the Buddha ground first attains ultimate completion. Due to this meaning, [the text] particularly explains three abodes. If following the *Mahāyānasamgraha*, one could say skin-complete-mind. Now following *Yogācāra*, hence only saying skin-flesh-substantial. Master Hong said: What cultivation eliminates mostly deludes about phenomena. Phenomenal dharmas are coarse and manifest, like skin being external, hence called skin-delusions. View-eliminated delusions delude about the principle of personal emptiness. Principle-dharmas are subtle and hidden, like complete being in the middle, hence called complete-delusions. That dharma-self-grasping deludes about dharma-emptiness principle. This principle is most profound, like mind being internal, hence called mind-delusions. [This is] extensively as in that chapter. However, in some places, these three obstacles are explained using affliction names. That is, regarding cognitive [obstacles], affliction names are explained. Hence [there is] no contradiction. Saying "harmful companion latent [afflictions], etc." explains these three names, as in the *Vijñānavāda* chapter. Question: What obstacles include these three latent [afflictions]? Explanation: There are three interpretations. First: These three are only cognitive obstacles. Second: The first two are afflictions, the third is cognitive. Third: These three are only afflictive obstacles. Though there are three interpretations, the latter explanation is correct. Question: Are these three latent [afflictions] the same in essence or not? Explanation: There are three explanations. First: The three types' essences are each different, because coarse-subtle differ. Second: Later ones include former ones, hence broad-narrow differ. Third: These three distinguish differences regarding stages, but essence has no distinctions. If in the five grounds, [they are] called harmful companions; reaching the sixth-seventh grounds, [they] transform to be called weak-inferior; from the eighth ground up, [they] transform to be called subtle. Among these three explanations, the third is correct. [This is] extensively as explained in Ximming's *Sandhinirmocana* commentary.

"Three delusions-karma-suffering... *Abhidharmasamuccaya* text explanation": Delusion-karma-suffering: Afflictions that generate karma and moisten birth are called delusions. That is, all discriminated afflictions of the desire realm can all generate karma and are all unwholesome. Those that naturally generate evil conduct are also unwholesome. That is, self-view and extreme views eliminated by the cultivation path, and greed, pride, and ignorance corresponding with these, are all not unwholesome, as explained in *Abhidharmasamuccaya* volume four. Various karmas capable of producing future existence are called karma. That is, [this] pervades all general retribution, particular retribution, present-future, etc. karmas. Excluding neutral karma and pure karma, all are called karma because [they] can produce maturation-birth. The multitude of sufferings produced and drawn by karma are called suffering. That is, three sufferings, eight sufferings, etc. These delusion-karma-sufferings all pervade discriminated and innate. Now this text precisely clarifies the discriminated three. That is, discriminated two obstacles, generated karma, and fruits are eliminated by the seeing path. This is precisely as explained in the previous second essence-extraction section, citing *Abhidharmasamuccaya* volume four. Hence [it] says "as in the *Abhidharmasamuccaya* text explanation already explained before." Someone says: "*Abhidharmasamuccaya* text explanation" should belong to the following text - this is incorrect. [It] doesn't accord with the text's meaning, hence cannot be relied upon.

"Innate karma-suffering... diamond mind": Above clarified the discriminated three; below precisely clarifies innate two-obstacles-generated karma-fruits. Within [this] there are two: first clarifying affliction-generated karma-fruits; later, below "within cognitive obstacles," clarifying cognitive obstacle-generated karma-fruits. This is precisely the first. [These are] innate karma-fruits within afflictive obstacles. Sinful karma is eliminated by essential nature, with grade-numbers as explained for delusions. Meritorious immovable karma is eliminated by conditional binding. That is, [one] can eliminate afflictions conditionally mixed with those. Wholesome neutral dharmas are eliminated by the cultivation path, then ultimately exhausted. Only small portions - each ground's ninth grade is exhausted. Immovable karma also has non-arising elimination, like mindless concentration. Fruits eliminated at seeing path time are also thus, not essential-nature elimination. If

eliminating regarding essence, the two vehicles [do so] when entering remainder-less [nirvana]; bodhisattvas [do so] when reaching diamond [mind].

"Affliction-karma-suffering... residing in Buddha ground": "Fragmentary [birth-death] non-arising residing in eighth ground, etc.": The *Compilation* says: If speaking of transformation-abandonment, gradual enlightenment enters the ten faiths and transforms-abandons fragmentary fruits; sudden enlightenment reaches the eighth ground, or first ground begins transforming. Now the chapter master depends on definitive explanation, hence says "residing in eighth ground." However, examining the *Compilation's* meaning, "gradual enlightenment enters ten faiths and transforms-abandons fragmentary fruits" - this meaning is difficult to understand. Ximming's *Sandhinirmocana* commentary volume four, explaining *Laṅkāvatāra's* meaning, says: The samādhi-bliss gates explained in *Laṅkāvatāra* volumes two and four mean stream-enterers, etc. turning mind toward the great [vehicle], making body long-abide, depending on limit-edge concentration, nourishing conditioned karma, receiving transformational birth, passing through eighty thousand kalpas or sixty thousand kalpas, etc., reaching the ten-faith stage. [It] explains that concentration as called samādhi-bliss, but not [calling] already abiding in remainder-less nirvana as samādhi. Already saying receiving transformational birth, reaching ten-faith stage - how now say "gradual enlightenment enters ten faiths abandoning fragmentary fruits"? Hence [we] know [this is] difficult to understand. Scholars should contemplate. Question: In commentary volume eight's four-sentence [analysis] of fragmentary-transformational, the third sentence says: "Or also receiving fragmentary [birth-death] and also receiving transformational [birth-death] - meaning the previous three fruits of indefinite nature before the seventh ground. This sentence is due to freedom, hence afflictions not yet exhausted." What is this meaning? Explanation: This sentence explains receiving two deaths regarding stages, not meaning one person completely receives two deaths. Among the previous three fruits, some receive fragmentary, some receive transformational. Because afflictions not yet exhausted, previously also thus. Or there are bodhisattvas who, though personally capable of receiving transformational [birth-death], on behalf of sentient beings receive three evil paths' suffering. This is

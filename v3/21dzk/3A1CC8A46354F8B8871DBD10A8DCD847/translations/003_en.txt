However, there is no defiled-pure. Because the power in the causal stage is weak, it is not like the fruition stage. Since the text already permits sudden arising, if mental consciousness arising together with the five consciousnesses is called "sudden" following the five consciousnesses, why not permit that the five consciousnesses arising together with seeking mental consciousness be called "seeking" following the mental consciousness? At that time, the five consciousnesses arising together with mental consciousness have desire and others arising, so determining is also the same. When seeking has already passed and defiled-pure has not yet arisen, the five consciousnesses turn following the mental consciousness. If it is not determining, what mind would this be called? Therefore it is known that the five consciousnesses also have the two minds of seeking and determining.

Regarding the text "In the causal stage the five lack... because the power is superior." In the causal stage the power is weak and cannot by its own power draw forth and accomplish defiled-pure. Therefore there are only four. Question: If the five consciousnesses arising together with seeking-determining mental consciousness are called seeking-determining, shouldn't the five consciousnesses arising together with defiled-pure mental consciousness also be called defiled-pure mind? The answer in the Compilation: "One should say that in the defiled-pure stage there are no five consciousnesses arising together." Why? In the middle three minds, if arising after the five consciousnesses, they must first objectify the object-realm that sudden arising objectified in the past, and only then objectify present similar objects. The two minds of seeking and determining, whether objectifying the past or objectifying similar objects, can all be called seeking and determining. Defiled-pure is not like this - only objectifying the past is called defiled-pure. If objectifying similar objects, it immediately belongs to uniform flow. Therefore in the defiled-pure stage, there are no five consciousnesses arising together. The mental consciousness at that time does not objectify the present. According to tradition, good-evil defiled-pure has weak power so does not arise; neutral defiled-pure arises but has no hindrance. What does not arise now refers only to good-evil. I think this is incorrect. Only objectifying the past is called defiled-pure, and if objectifying similar objects it immediately belongs to uniform flow, but then would the neutral defiled-pure of the five consciousnesses

objectify the past?

Regarding the text "According to one view, at the eighth ground... the seventh and eighth each have four." This is the second master's view. This master's intention is that the five consciousnesses in the causal stage also have defiled-pure. From the eighth ground onward, the five consciousnesses become autonomous and do not depend on the power of mental consciousness or mutual drawing of before and after, and also accomplish defiled-pure. The seventh and eighth follow this example. As the text states, it can be understood.

Regarding the text "In this, according to one view... because it permits random arising." This is the third master's view. According to tradition, this is Master Tai's view, and Masters Xiao and others also make this explanation, as in the Golden Drum Commentary. This master's intention is that since the Yogācāra already says "In the first three minds, the first is the five consciousnesses, the second is in mental consciousness," and also says "At the time of uniform-flow mind, there are eye-consciousness and others," therefore as the text states, there are only two minds. "Because it permits random arising" means: if sudden mind objectifies familiar objects, immediately following this mind, determining mind arises. As the treatise explains, "Mental consciousness arising immediately after the five consciousnesses is either seeking or determining." Therefore it is known that seeking mind does not necessarily arise. Up to uniform flow should be understood similarly. This is called random arising. These randomly arising minds are all previous uniform flow. Therefore the five consciousnesses have only sudden arising and uniform flow.

Regarding the text "Here, first depending on... explaining easy-to-recognize objects." This reconciles the texts cited by the third master. "Depending on manifest superior dharmas" refers to the gross characteristics approach. When the Yogācāra treatise says "The first is the five consciousnesses, the second is in mental consciousness, etc.," it depends on the gross characteristics approach - neutral without confusion, easy-to-recognize object-realms. However, this does not exhaust the principle. Texts found elsewhere should all be reconciled according to this.

Regarding the text "For what reason not permit... in principle also superior." This criticizes the third master's view. First principles are stated,

then texts are cited. "The Vijñaptimātratā states, etc." refers to text from the fourth volume. "Attaining the autonomous stage, etc." means from the eighth ground onward and the Buddha's fruition stage - being autonomous regarding objects and not borrowing discrimination. Therefore it says "spontaneous." There is no further doubt. Therefore it says "determining." Although without desire, all have nothing unknown. Therefore it says "not borrowing seeking." Why don't those five consciousness-bodies continue? The reason for citing this proof is: if in the autonomous stage, already familiar objects do not necessarily require seeking before determining. Reversing this to understand by analogy: if in the not-yet-autonomous stage with unfamiliar objects, in those five consciousnesses there should not be only sudden arising without giving rise to seeking. Therefore it is known that the five consciousnesses fully possess the five minds.

Regarding the text "The fourth moment... there are not many sudden arisings." This clarifies that the sudden arising of the five consciousnesses is one moment. If sudden arising of other consciousnesses should also be one moment. Because initially falling into objects is called sudden arising. "The five consciousness-bodies do not have two moments, etc." - immediately depending on this text, the fourth volume of Vijñaptimātratā has roughly three explanations. First: the five consciousnesses are only one moment; in the before and after of their own type, there is definitely no two moments following each other and immediately arising. Therefore the sixth consciousness serves as the immediately preceding condition. Second: this depends on the not-yet-autonomous base; mostly sudden arising is only one moment, not uniform-flow mind and the autonomous stage. Therefore it is known that the five consciousnesses, within the first six consciousnesses, following whichever consciousness, serve as the immediately preceding condition. The third correct view: each uses its own type as the immediately preceding condition. It does not speak of the continuous moments of the five consciousnesses. Details follow that explanation. "From this, mental consciousness necessarily arises immediately afterward, etc." This text proves that after sudden mind, seeking definitely arises. As the Gashō explanation states.

Regarding the text "Explaining that the five consciousness-bodies... have no subtle ones." Regarding explaining that the five consciousness-bodies have vitarka-vicāra, Vijñaptimātratā

【Lower Section】
volume seven has two explanations. The first master says: Yogācāra volume fifty-six asks: "In the second dhyāna and above, eye-consciousness and others with vitarka-vicāra are present. How can this ground be without vitarka and without vicāra, etc.?" Therefore it is known that the five consciousnesses have vitarka-vicāra. The second master says: Yogācāra volume one explains "seeking investigation is the seventh discrimination." This is not shared with mental consciousness, being in mental consciousness, etc. Therefore it is known that vitarka-vicāra exist only in mental consciousness. The chapter master judges: "The first master's view is not appropriate. Even extending through Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna, this is so in principle." "Extensive seeking" refers to deep and broad characteristics - namely the characteristics of seeking activity. "What the various places explain, etc." reconciles contradictions. According to tradition, Master Huiji,述基師's intention: "That the five consciousnesses have seeking refers to positional seeking, not substantial seeking. Because the five consciousness-bodies are only direct perception." I think this is incorrect. This text already says "lacking deep and broad characteristics. Explaining this as absent. Not lacking subtle ones." It is clearly known that subtle seeking is substantial seeking.

Regarding the text "If independently arising mental consciousness... principle also does not obstruct." Above clarified that sudden arising of the five consciousnesses is only one moment. Below clarifies that sudden arising of mental consciousness is also one moment. Here first contradictory texts are reconciled, then different explanations are described. This reconciles contradictions. Yogācāra volume one explains that the five consciousnesses have sudden arising, not explaining mental consciousness. In volume three, it explains sudden arising of mental consciousness. Being thus contradictory, now this is reconciled. If speaking completely, it should say "Initially it is the six consciousnesses, and the next two minds are necessarily mental consciousness." In the initial one moment, it briefly does not explain that mental consciousness also has sudden arising. This is speaking according to one characteristic that is gross and manifest, not exhaustive principle. Also lacking the word "only," it does not obstruct that the initial mind also has mental consciousness and the latter two minds also have five consciousnesses. Therefore it says "principle also does not obstruct."

"as uninterrupted paths, etc." "Preparatory and advancement are the same as before, general and specific, etc." means: separately arising the paths of the nine grounds is called "specific"; if combining two, three, etc., it is called "general."

Question: Do the learners of the two vehicles practice the six-fold contemplation?
Answer: Those of the first three fruits can practice this contemplation, but only contaminated.
Question: If so, how do sages suppress the lower to be born in the upper?
Answer: Sages, through the power of this contemplation, necessarily eliminate lower defilements before being born in upper grounds. This differs from ordinary beings who suppress the lower to be born in the upper.

"However, the *Abhidharma Compendium*, up to 'not contradictory'": This self-questions and answers to reconcile contradictory texts. However, *Abhidharma* fascicle eight completely lacks this text. Only fascicle nine says: "Advancement path means: the existing preparatory, uninterrupted, and liberation paths for eliminating remaining categories of afflictions are called advancement paths." Now it points to that text. *Consciousness-Only* commentary fascicle ten also quotes *Abhidharma* fascicle nine's text to explain advancement doctrine. This question's meaning reveals: *Abhidharma* only explains advancement regarding the general, so why does *Consciousness-Only* sometimes explain advancement doctrine regarding general and specific? This is precisely the question. "*Consciousness-Only* relies on specific cultivation characteristics, etc." is the answer. *Consciousness-Only* explains based on arising separate advancement beyond this category's preparatory [paths]; *Abhidharma* explains only regarding that category's existing preparatory [paths], etc. advancing the previous meaning. Each relies on one aspect, so they don't contradict.

"If following this doctrine, also subsequent preparatory": This again explains and establishes the two treatises' meaning. Since specific cultivation characteristics and subsequent doctrine are the same in both treatises, *Abhidharma* can also say "sometimes general, sometimes specific" like *Consciousness-Only*. Speaking of "specific cultivation characteristics" means beyond this category's preparatory [paths], separately arising subsequent advancement. If judging the two treatises' meaning by principle, previous categories' liberation paths also become subsequent preparatory

[paths] because they can lead to subsequent [stages]. The *Compendium* says: "Though reasonable in principle, no authoritative explanation has been seen. Also, advancement doctrine applies generally from liberation onward, all being advancement. Preparatory doctrine is limited, only calling aspiration and elimination 'preparatory,' not calling everything before uninterrupted 'preparatory,' so it's not analogous." The present chapter master's intention: only calling aspiration and elimination "preparatory" explains specific cultivation characteristics, so this is limited. Calling "capable of leading to subsequent [stages]" preparatory explains according to general doctrine. Therefore the two treatises correspond and are entirely the same.

"*Consciousness-Only* further says, what difference with the two vehicles": In clarifying similarities and differences among the three vehicles' four paths, this is precisely the second [section] clarifying the bodhisattva vehicle's four paths. "This relies on bodhisattvas" below is the chapter master's text. "Mutually viewing before and after, all can possess" means: if bodhisattvas have sharp faculties, like the first category's uninterrupted [path], reaching the second moment becomes liberation. This first category's uninterrupted [path], viewed in relation to the second category, becomes preparatory. This liberation path, viewed in relation to the second category becomes uninterrupted; viewed in relation to the first becomes liberation; viewed in relation to subsequent [categories] becomes preparatory. Reaching the third uninterrupted path, viewed in relation to the first becomes advancement; regarding the second category becomes liberation; regarding its own category becomes uninterrupted; regarding the fourth becomes preparatory. The second uninterrupted [path], viewed in relation to previous [categories] is not advancement but only liberation. This is the method when bodhisattvas in the ten grounds eliminate cognitive obstacles by categorizing and sequentially eliminating. When eliminating separately, each arises separately. Through being able to authenticate, eliminate delusions, accommodate, and aspire, they complete the four paths. Otherwise, the four doctrines cannot be complete. The *Compendium* says: "Because bodhisattvas have sharp faculties and superior path-power, moment by moment, the four

paths are all general. The first moment is only preparatory path because delusions have not yet been eliminated. In the second moment there is also uninterrupted [path] because it correctly eliminates the first category and approaches the second elimination. In the third moment it also adds liberation because it realizes the cessation of the first category, eliminates the second category, and approaches the third elimination. The fourth moment completes the four paths. Its meaning can be understood. From here onward, each moment completes the four paths. The present meaning is entirely the same. Therefore it says 'each moment's characteristics all possess, etc.'" There is a separate diagram of the bodhisattva's four paths, as in the diagram on the left. Its meaning can be understood. That bodhisattvas complete the four [paths] in each moment: above there are nine ○s representing categories to be treated; below, twelve ○s are precisely the paths that can treat.

Question: Do advancement paths extend to the Buddha stage? If they extend, why does *Consciousness-Only* commentary fascicle ten say "there is no advancement in Buddha stage"? If they don't extend, why say "there is no receiving blissful advancement"?
Answer: Advancement has two meanings: first, advancing to other superior paths; second, receiving extraordinary bliss. Because it advances beyond previous times, it's called "advancement," but Buddha stage lacks this. Because there is previous advancement doctrine, it's said to be absent. The latter receiving bliss doctrine can also exist in Buddhas, therefore it's said to exist.
Question: If the receiving bliss doctrine is called advancement, what is its meaning?
Answer: After eliminating delusions, realizing and attaining the unconditioned, the mind rejoices. Generally, all wholesome [states] after eliminating delusions are advancement paths of receiving bliss.
Question: Since Buddha stage is already ultimate perfection,

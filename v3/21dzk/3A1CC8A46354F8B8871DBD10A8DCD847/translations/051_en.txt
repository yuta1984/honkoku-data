Non-defiled path truth either belongs to wishlessness because it is conditioned, or belongs to signlessness because it is a cause of nirvana. Additionally explaining: or both of these do not belong to the three gates - because [they are] not of the three realms and not nirvana either. If following this text, the three gates are all not proper elimination paths. Or only the emptiness gate can universally eliminate and suppress. Though in preparatory [stages one] sees that self is non-existent, in proper contemplation [one] realizes emptiness nature.

"Some say three gates, up to 'because of principle division'": In proper wisdom contemplation, meaning divides into three gates, etc. Using the meaning within one moment of proper wisdom contemplation, [it] divides into three gates and sixteen [practices], therefore immediately citing two texts as evidence. *Yogācāra* fascicle seventy-two explains this one meaning in discussing five dharmas: If proclaimed using only liberation gate names, one should know this contains only supramundane cultivation-perfected nature. Also *Consciousness-Only* fascicle eight says: How do three liberation gates' practiced realms correspond with these three natures? In principle all apply universally; according to characteristics, each is one. Therefore [we] know that objectifying one true suchness principle completely gives rise to three gates. Namely, within the principle manifested by two emptinesses - because two selves are empty, this is called emptiness; because [it] separates from all characteristics, [it] is called signlessness; because there is nothing to pray for, [it] is called wishlessness. Therefore one essence divides in meaning into three. Sixteen practice characteristics should also be understood likewise. Within one true principle, [they] divide according to verbal designation, therefore *Abhidharma* says: Extensively, four truths; briefly, true suchness. If following this meaning, three gates objectifying perfectly realized [nature] can all eliminate and suppress because [they] directly realize principle. Three gates objectifying the other two natures are all not proper elimination because [they] do not realize truth.

"If using separate practices, up to 'principles have no obstruction'": If using separate practices, mostly only using emptiness gate to eliminate afflictions, etc. Above explained universal gates; below clarifies separate gates. If using separate gates, mostly only using emptiness gate to eliminate afflictions because [it] empties two selves. This is universal-objectifying emptiness, etc. Generally emptiness has two types: First, universal-objectifying emptiness - because [it] universally empties two selves on four truths. Second, particular-objectifying emptiness - because [it] only particularly empties two selves on suffering. Now saying "because two selves are empty" refers to universal-objectifying emptiness. Particular emptiness only [applies to] suffering and does not extend to others, therefore [it] should accordingly be included in fundamental wisdom and subsequently-attained wisdom. Whether eliminating or suppressing, principles have no obstruction. Three liberation gates' meaning is as explained in *Yogācāra*, *Wisdom Treatise*, *Prakaraṇāryavāca*, *Abhidharma*, *Vibhāṣā*, etc.

"Two suffering, etc. six, up to 'not capable of elimination'": These six practices are only defiled preparatory grounds, etc. For suppressing afflictive obstacles, both preparatory and fundamental [levels] of six form realm grounds and four formless realm grounds can suppress them. If using six practices to suppress [applies to] preparatory grounds. If seven mental applications, etc., [they] apply to both fundamental and preparatory [levels]. Only the seventh mental application enters fundamental [level]. 

Question: Are these six practice wisdoms only defiled, or do they also apply to non-defiled?
Answer: These are only defiled.
Question: If so, ordinary beings' six wisdoms can be defiled. How are sages' six practices defiled?
Answer: Sages' six practices are also defiled. The reason is that various sages, using mundane wisdoms subsequently attained after supramundane wisdom, when separating from desires, immediately perform six practice wisdoms, etc., damaging and suppressing affliction seeds. Through this principle, sages' six practices are also defiled. From this we can understand that within seeing path stage, [they] do not arise six practices. Only within cultivation path do [they] arise using mundane wisdom.

"Applying to both ordinary beings and sages, up to 'because of taking birth'": Applying to both ordinary beings and sages, etc. *Yogācāra* thirty-three says: There are four types of individuals who, in present dharma, delight in following mundane paths and initiate preparatory practices, not supramundane paths. First, all non-Buddhists. Second, those within true dharma whose faculties are weak and who first cultivate proper practices. Third, those whose faculties are sharp but whose good roots are not yet mature. Fourth, all bodhisattvas who delight in attaining great enlightenment in future lives, not in present dharma. There are also two types: First, completely bound - namely various [beings of] different natures. Second, incompletely bound - namely various learners. First observing desire realm as coarse nature, observing first meditation - whether concentration or birth - as tranquil nature, and so forth extensively.

Answer: Following mundane paths means precisely these six practices. Since [it] says all four types cultivate [them], therefore [we] know [they] apply to ordinary beings, two vehicles, and bodhisattvas. However, among bodhisattvas, most are pre-ground [level]. Ten-ground bodhisattvas do not delight in higher [realms] and despise lower [ones] because [they] take birth [purposefully].

"Base ground division explains, up to 'not using as superior'": Base ground division explains first eon bodhisattvas, etc. [This] precisely refers to fascicle thirty-three text quoted above, therefore that text's explanation of four types cultivating six practices says: Fourth, all bodhisattvas delight in attaining great bodhisattva[hood] in future lives, not in present dharma. Up to: First observing desire realm as [coarse] nature, observing first meditation - whether concentration or birth - as tranquil nature.

Answer: All bodhisattvas means precisely first eon resource-accumulation stage bodhisattvas, like Vipaśyanā bodhisattvas, etc. Now the chapter author's intention uses meaning to quote text, not exactly like original text. However, long-time cultivators, etc. means

bodhisattvas at the stage of cultivating decisive selection divisions, etc. Since [they] do not eliminate afflictions yet are born in higher realms, therefore [they] do not use [six practices] as superior. Now saying "eliminate" means suppressive elimination because [they] have not yet attained non-defiled. Another explanation: long-time cultivators means bodhisattvas who have generated aspiration for a long time and already attained non-defiled ground-entering [level], etc. Since [it] says [they] do not eliminate afflictions yet are born in higher realms, if not ground-entering, how could [it] say "eliminate"? [This] precisely proves the above statement that ten-ground bodhisattvas do not use six practices, explaining and completing base ground division's meaning. Saying "not using as superior": some person transmits saying this has two explanations. First: long-time cultivating bodhisattvas cultivate non-defiled wisdom as superior practice, not using six practices as superior. Second: in above text, from "applying to both ordinary beings and sages" down, there are altogether two explanations. One explanation: six practices exist only in two vehicles, not applying to bodhisattvas - from "applying to both ordinary beings and sages" to "because of taking birth." One explanation: six practices are not only used by two vehicles but also apply to bodhisattvas who use them - from "base ground division explains" to "born in higher realms." Among these two explanations, ten-ground bodhisattvas do not use six practices as superior, therefore [it] says "not using as superior." Now I think this is incorrect. "Base ground division explains," etc. below precisely proves above meaning, not separate teacher explanations, because textual appearance is thus.

"However *Yogācāra* treatise, up to 'two vehicles also use'": This reconciles contradictions.
Question: If six practices suppressing afflictions apply to both ordinary beings and sages, why does *Yogācāra* sixty-nine say sages do not use six practices?
Therefore now reconciling: fascicle sixty-nine's meaning depends on majority explanation. Speaking of actual principle, ordinary beings and sages equally use [them]. *Compilation* says: Examining sixty-nine 《marginal note: Head teacher [says] sixty-nine text clearly [shows] sages also use six practices. Though [they] apply to both mundane and supramundane, [it] is not that [they] are not six practices. Chapter text's "not" character is copying error and should be written as "also" character, etc.》

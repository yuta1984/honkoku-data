establishing the supporting cause. Among these, the first five depend on distant supportive relationships, thus accomplishing the conditioned dharmas of the three realms. If the six are combined for distant supportive relationships, they determine unconditioned dharmas. The sixth dependency does not extend to conditioned [dharmas]. What assists and accomplishes causation is called "support," hence excluding [primary] causation. *Abhidharmasamuccaya* (examining volume 4 [sixteenth right]) says: Like fields, water, fertilizer, etc., in relation to grains producing sprouts, etc. Though produced by their own seeds, they nevertheless increase that power. [This is] named supporting cause. Among these six dependencies, the unconditioned has all six, the conditioned has only five. Not all conditioned [dharmas] completely possess the five, etc. The arising of mind and mental factors all possess the five dependencies. For non-mind-mental-factors, the principle is indefinite. Among these, the first five extend to neutral causes; the latter one does not. "Due to being supported by personal-effort dependency" - there are two [types of] personal effort. First, regarding dharmas, named personal effort. Second, regarding conventional persons, named personal effort. Like eye-consciousness arising, taking eye-root and seeds as personal-effort dependency, taking immediately-preceding conditions, object-conditions, etc. as function dependency. Roots are relatively proximate. This speaks regarding dharmas as personal effort. If conventional persons serve as personal effort, persons in relation to grain sprouts have persons as personal effort, earth and water, etc. as functions. Functions are more distant than human effort (examining: one edition has the two characters "if depending" below "hence"). *Yogācārabhūmi* volume 38 (volume 38 lacks the complete text; this commentary volume 8 original [eleventh left] text. Some say it's summary text from volume 38 [tenth left]). Among neutral causes, all have personal effort. All take earth, water, etc. as personal effort, sun and plows/smelting as functions. Now regarding dharmic personal effort, explaining supportive meaning. When derived [matter] arises, taking the productive great [elements] and their seeds as personal-effort dependency. When great [elements] face produced [matter], they serve as proximate conditions. The remaining various conditions serve as function dependency. Now clarifying personal-effort dependency, hence saying "due to being supported by personal-effort dependency."

From "Fourth, developing cause" to "and self-nature": Speaking of "developing cause" - precisely depending on the eleventh accordance dependency location to establish this cause. Namely, dharmas of the three natures extending to the unconditioned. The various activities of manifest and seed-[stages] can accord with dharmas of similar types and superior qualities. "Similar type" excludes different types serving as causes - this is only regarding cause-nature. "Superior quality" excludes one's own similar type serving as cause for inferior qualities. *Mahāśāstra* volume 5, etc. says neutral [dharmas] serve as causes for wholesome and defiled [dharmas]. However, regarding manifest activities, their natures are also the same. They also serve as causes for nirvana. Manifest [phenomena] pulling seeds, seeds pulling manifest [phenomena], seeds pulling seeds - all are this cause. Discussing realms and natures, they mutually have broad and narrow [applications]. As in *Prakaraṇāryavāca* (examining volume 18 [fourteenth right]). Now temporarily discussing developing causes among neutral ten causes. Sprouts, stems, fruits, etc., in successive continuity, facing that agriculture, whether maturing or ripening, serve as developing causes. Fifth, determining-difference cause - precisely depending on the twelfth differential-capacity dependency location to establish this cause. This is only self-nature. Even if other-natured, it also only corresponds. Namely, wholesome karma definitely pulls human and heavenly eighth consciousness, not evil destinations. Due to correspondence. Not separate natures being non-corresponding serving as causes. Namely, dharmas of one's own realm serve as causes for one's own realm. Within matter, internal serves as cause for internal. Within internal, nourishment serves as cause for nourishment, etc. (etc.). If regarding conditioned [dharmas], as causes capable of producing results; if regarding unconditioned [dharmas], as causes capable of realizing those results. Differential power - cause-nature correspondence is called "determining." Not sharing with others, hence called "different." If neutral causes: barley only produces barley, not producing beans, etc. [This is] named determining-difference cause. "Pulling similar-type arising" explains developing cause. This

cause, though pulling similar and superior qualities, when great [elements] face produced [matter], they only pull similar qualities, having no superior qualities. The reason for this: producer and produced necessarily share safety and danger, hence having no superior qualities. "And self-nature" explains determining-difference cause. The great [elements] producing the five sense-objects each take their own mutual correspondence as cause. Being separately determined, hence saying "due to self-nature."

From "Sixth, collaborative cause" to "for these two reasons": Collaborative cause - precisely depending on the thirteenth harmonious-combination dependency location to establish this cause. Among the ten causes, from depending cause through determining-difference cause, taking these six causes as this cause-nature. Not taking verbal designation due to its distance. Verbal designation doesn't harmoniously combine with dharmas, its power being distant, hence not taking it as nature. Since the cause is precisely the previous [ones], its result is also thus. Regarding arising and other results, concerning one matter-activity. This cause extends to both conditioned and unconditioned. This discusses cause-essence regarding the three natures. If neutral causes: beginning from depending cause, ending with determining-difference cause, together accomplishing agricultural matters' maturation [is] named collaborative cause. Non-conflicting cause - precisely depending on the fifteenth non-obstruction dependency location to establish this cause. Regarding arising, abiding, accomplishing, obtaining matters, none serve as obstructions, taking all dharmas as nature. If neutral causes: frost, hail, disasters, etc. facing blue and other sprouts are obstruction causes. When these obstructions are either lacking or separated, [this is] named non-conflicting cause. Among the seven causes, these latter two causes don't contradict the previous five, together determining their results, hence saying "encompassing previous causes for these two reasons."

From "That conflicting cause" to "no depending cause": Among these ten causes, only taking seven causes, excluding the remaining three causes.

【Lower Section】
Speaking of "conflicting cause" - precisely depending on the fourteenth obstruction dependency location to establish this cause. Regarding arising, abiding, etc., dharmas capable of obstruction are named conflicting causes. These conflicting causes and non-conflicting [causes] both extend to conditioned and unconditioned. Results are also thus. Preventing conditioned unconditioned [dharmas] from arising, preventing unconditioned [dharmas] from manifesting. If following Mahāyāna: though cessation characteristics don't depend on causes, conflicting causes serve as arising causes for later dharmas, being conflicting with previous dharmas [is] named conflicting cause. [This is] not serving as cause for previous dharmas' cessation. Generally, when cause and effect are mutually opposite, [this] serves as conflicting cause. Great [elements] facing derived matter have harmonious cause-result, necessarily sharing loss and benefit, hence having no conflicting cause. That designating cause takes sound as nature. Great [elements] are not verbal designations, hence great [elements] regarding produced [matter] lack this causal meaning. Distant mutual dependence is named depending cause. Great [elements] and derived matter sprouts intimately mutually depend, hence having no depending cause.

From "According to [another] interpretation, eight" to "adding conflicting cause": This is the second explanation of the next two theories. The second interpretation says: great [elements] facing derived matter collectively have eight causes. Among the previously excluded, only excluding designating and conflicting causes. Producer and produced are established through mutual dependence - how could there be no dependence? Also extending to dependence, establishing these producer-produced two. "According to [another] interpretation, perhaps nine," etc. is the third explanation. Great [elements] facing derived matter collectively have nine causes. Among the ten causes, only excluding designating cause, the remaining nine all exist. The reason for adding conflicting cause: among neutral causes, frost and other four great [elements] facing their yellow leaves are conflicting causes. Generally, conflicting causes only serve as causes for yellow leaves, not serving as causes for already-perished blue [leaves], etc. This is precisely what conflicts serving as cause, hence named conflicting cause. Conflicting results refer to yellow leaves. Therefore, great [elements] facing produced [matter],

"Six: the five patiences, up to 'universally eliminating and suppressing'": Speaking of "five patiences" - these are suppression patience, faith patience, conformity patience, non-arising patience, and cessation patience. Suppression patience, as its name indicates, only suppresses and does not eliminate. The remaining [patiences], according to what is appropriate, apply to both elimination and suppression. The old *Saṃgraha* treatise says: Moment by moment, [they] can destroy affliction clusters that are to be counteracted, cause those that are not counteracted to perish, and cause those that are not counteracted to weaken and perish - this is elimination. Weakening is precisely suppression. Also, faith patience and conformity patience suppress through preparatory wisdom and eliminate through fundamental [wisdom]. Non-arising [patience] and cessation [patience] mostly suppress through fundamental [wisdom] and also eliminate through fundamental [wisdom]. "Suppression through circumstantial power" means not being able to suppress through intentional power, but only naturally suppressing when non-defiled [wisdom] arises. However, within cessation [patience], though there are also buddhas, they are not included in elimination - within cessation patience, two stages are comprehensively included: first, cause; second, result. If included in causal stage, [they] immediately eliminate obstacle essence and remove subtle hindrances. If included in buddha stage, [they] only abandon subtle hindrances and do not eliminate obstacle essence. Therefore it says "though there are also buddhas, they are not included in elimination." "Ten-ground bodhisattva path stages being already long, etc." - because [they] pass through two incalculable [eons], they are called long. Speaking of "universally suppressing and eliminating": affliction obstacle's cultivation-eliminated affliction seeds are suddenly eliminated at vajra [-like concentration]. Those obstacles' manifest arising is suddenly suppressed above [first] ground. Knowledge obstacle's cultivation-eliminated seeds are gradually eliminated through ten grounds. Those obstacles' manifest arising, up to tenth ground, are then permanently suppressed and exhausted. Therefore it says "universally eliminating and suppressing."

"Seven: six clear realizations, up to 'eliminating phenomenal afflictions'": Six clear realizations means contemplation, faith, precepts, clear realization wisdom truth, marginal wisdom truth, and ultimate clear realization. If briefly explaining essence: contemplation takes superior wisdom arising from contemplation in ordinary being stage as essence. Faith takes superior pure faith in mundane

and supramundane [realms] that objects the Three Jewels as nature. Precepts take non-defiled precepts as essence. Clear realization wisdom truth takes wisdom that objects non-established truth realm in seeing path as nature. Marginal wisdom truth takes subsequent-attainment wisdom that objects established truth realm as nature. Ultimate takes fundamental and subsequent-attainment exhaustion and non-arising wisdom, etc. as nature.

Question: Among three wisdoms, why doesn't learning wisdom separately establish clear realization?
Answer: Learning wisdom only arises from objectifying teachings and has not yet attained certainty, therefore it is not separately established.

These six clear realizations are differentiated according to four counteractives, as explained in *Yogācāra* treatise fascicle seventy-one. The *Compilation* says: According to textual explanation, as in *Yoga* fifty-five and seventy-one which extensively explain their characteristics. Now saying "contemplation clear realization only suppresses, etc." is precisely explaining according to principle. If explaining according to principle: contemplation, only in desire realm, only suppresses and does not eliminate. Faith, precepts, truth, and marginal apply to both suppression and elimination. Both direct elimination and auxiliary elimination attain the name "elimination." Faith and precepts are auxiliary elimination; truth and marginal are direct elimination. Therefore all attain the name "elimination." Faith extends to non-defiled, therefore it is auxiliary elimination. Marginal is wisdom that eliminates confusion about phenomena, therefore it is direct elimination. Extensively as explained in *Yogācāra*, *Consciousness-only*, etc.

"If following *Abhidharma*, up to 'already eliminated previously'": *Abhidharma*'s explained clear realization marginal conventional wisdom differs in meaning from *Yogācāra*'s explained marginal truth clear realization. [*Abhidharma*] explains that what is attained and cultivated in seeing path only manifests in cultivation path. Because it is only conventional wisdom, it cannot eliminate afflictions. *Yogācāra* treatise's "marginal truth clear realization" takes pure non-defiled wisdom of true and relative seeing paths, and because [it] applies to direct elimination, taking *Yogācāra* as correct. "Ultimate contemplation is not, etc." - ultimate clear realization does not eliminate afflictions because [they were] already eliminated previously. This explains

eliminating afflictions. If eliminating concentration obstacles etc., even two-vehicle ultimate can accommodate elimination meaning. These various meanings are as explained in separate chapters.

"Eight: seven mental applications, up to 'different from Yogācāra'": These seven mental applications' precise nature and essence take mental application mental factor as essence. If explaining through association, according to what is appropriate, simultaneous mind and mental factors serve as essence - either twenty-three or twenty-four, extensively as explained in *Abhidharma* commentary. Inclusion in four counteractives is as explained in *Yogācāra* sixteen. Inclusion in four paths is as explained in sixty-two. Inclusion in four mental applications is as explained in *Yogācāra* thirty-two. These mental applications' inclusion is as explained in *Yogācāra* fascicle eleven.

"First: discerning characteristics, etc.": If following *Abhidharma* ninth [fascicle], briefly explaining: discerning characteristics mental application - regarding what should be eliminated and attained, being able to correctly understand, for the sake of elimination and attainment, gives rise to aspiration in mind. Superior understanding mental application - for the sake of elimination and attainment, correctly initiates preparatory practices. Separation mental application can abandon possessed superior afflictions. Joyful absorption mental application can abandon possessed medium afflictions. Investigation mental application can, regarding what is attained, separate from pride and stabilize that mind. Preparatory culmination mental application can abandon possessed inferior afflictions. Preparatory culmination result mental application can correctly receive and accept those various mental applications' good cultivation.

Commentary: Since this is already mundane path, it only suppresses coarse entanglements and does not eliminate latent tendencies. Regarding *Abhidharma* and *Yogācāra* being different: in *Yogācāra* treatise, extending through mundane and supramundane, it explains seven mental applications. In *Abhidharma* treatise, only based on mundane path, it explains seven mental applications. Because these are different, it says "different from *Yogācāra*." Extensively as the *Compilation*

explains.

"Sixth: according to practice, up to 'four truths sixteen practices'": Regarding "emptiness, signlessness, etc.": Sarvāstivāda establishes suffering's subordinate emptiness and non-self two practices as emptiness liberation gate. Establishing suffering's subordinate suffering and impermanence two practices and collection's subordinate four practices as wishlessness liberation gate. Establishing cessation's subordinate four practices as signlessness liberation gate. 

*Tattvasiddhi* school says: Taking true wisdom as nature, following expedient means, [they are] called three gates. Namely, calling provisional names' emptiness "emptiness liberation," calling actual dharmas' emptiness "signlessness gate," calling this emptiness also being empty "wishlessness gate."

In Mahāyāna school, various texts differ. *Yogācāra* seventy-four says: Three liberation gates are established through three self-natures. Namely, through constructed [nature], therefore called emptiness liberation gate; through dependent [nature], therefore called wishlessness gate; through perfected [nature], therefore called signlessness gate.

"Suffering, coarseness, etc. six practices": Suffering, coarseness, obstruction three are inferior realm's faults and sufferings. Tranquility, excellence, separation three are superior realm's merits. These are called six practices.

"Sixteen practices": Four truths each having four therefore constitute sixteen. Suffering truth's four are: suffering, emptiness, impermanence, non-self. Up to path truth's four are: path, suchness, practice, exit. Extensively as explained in *Yogācāra*, *Abhidharma*, etc.

"First: emptiness, wishlessness, up to 'only included in concentration'": These are all treatise texts. Therefore that text says: If without distinctions, comprehensively called "emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness" - these extend through wisdom arising from learning, contemplation, cultivation, and mundane and supramundane. If called "emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness samādhi" - these are only wisdom arising from cultivation.

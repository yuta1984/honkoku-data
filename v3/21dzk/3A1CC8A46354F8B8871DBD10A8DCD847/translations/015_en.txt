The good friend wheel treats the difficulty of before and after Buddha, the wheel of personally generating right vows treats the difficulty of worldly intelligence and eloquence, and the wheel of previously planted good roots treats the difficulty of incomplete faculties. For details, see other passages.

Regarding "Question: Vehicle is conveyance... not establishing Buddha Vehicle." The Profound Commentary says: Because causal practice can convey itself to fruition, it can be called vehicle. Because Buddha's fruition ceases self-conveyance, it should not be the substance of vehicle. This present text agrees with that.

Regarding "Answer: Both self and others... no obstruction to establishing Buddha Vehicle." In the Profound Commentary, the first meaning that establishes doctrine and answers says: Taking conveyance as the name of vehicle. In the cause, it universally conveys two things; reaching fruition, it extensively conveys others. Due to this, it is also called vehicle. This present text corresponds to that first meaning. The other four meanings have somewhat different intentions. This can be known by investigation.

Regarding "Question: Why is there... called Solitary Awakening Vehicle." The meaning of this question is: Why do some places separately explain Buddha Vehicle and also separately call it Bodhisattva Vehicle, yet among the Two Vehicles, they only call it Śrāvaka Vehicle and do not separately establish the name Solitary Awakening Vehicle? Now based on the majority, first depending on this question.

Regarding "Answer: Using fruit characteristics... there is no contradiction." The meaning of the answer is: Using fruit to contrast with cause - because awakening fruition is uniquely superior, only Buddha Vehicle is explained. Using cause to contrast with fruit - because the two conveyances are particularly superior. To manifest extensive conveyance, Bodhisattva Vehicle is explained. If so, the two names are already questioned. Why must the other two names be separately explained? Therefore, explaining: "Because practices etc. are extensive, it is called Great Vehicle." As the sūtra says: "Compassionately bringing peace and happiness to limitless beings, benefiting humans and gods, liberating all - therefore called Great Vehicle. Because it blocks the other two, it is also called One Vehicle." The treatise explains "blocking" saying: "No Two Vehicles means no two nirvāṇa

substances." Manifesting the actual two conveyances, blocking the provisional two fruits. Due to these two meanings, the other two names are explained. However, in the name "One Vehicle," "one" has three meanings. First, called "one" because of distinction - in former days explaining three, in present times explaining one. Not separately distinguishing, there are no three, only no two extremes. Second, called "one" because of breaking distinctions - breaking their emotional attachment to there being two fruit extremes, therefore explained as one. Third, called "one" because of gathering distinctions - gathering the teaching, principle, practice, and fruit that gradual awakening practitioners previously cultivated, achieved, and obtained in the Two Vehicles as great expedient means. Now saying "blocking the other two" means distinguishing and therefore calling it one. Naming it "one" is this.

Regarding "Question: Already using fruit... should be extensively explained." The meaning of the question is: If already using fruit to contrast with cause and calling it Buddha Vehicle, then also using fruit to contrast with cause it should be called Buddha Piṭaka. Why only call it Bodhisattva Piṭaka and not call it Buddha Piṭaka? Also, in the Small Vehicle, śrāvakas are cause and solitary awakeners are fruit. Also using fruit to contrast should be called Solitary Awakening Piṭaka. If this is permitted, then śrāvakas and solitary awakeners can both obtain the piṭaka name. Saying "in the Piṭaka Chapter it should naturally be extensively explained" means in the various piṭaka chapters, answering with three meanings, the second meaning says: In the Small Vehicle, śrāvakas are cause and solitary awakeners are fruit. Taking the name from the lesser, it is not called Solitary Awakening Piṭaka. In the Great Vehicle, bodhisattvas are cause and Tathāgatas are fruit. Taking the designation from the lesser, it is not called Tathāgata Piṭaka. This present question corresponds to that meaning. This can be known by investigation.

Regarding "Question: Teaching, principle, practice... are they same or different?" The meaning of the question is: If teaching, principle, practice, and fruit are the substance of One Vehicle, are they the same or different when looking at the various vehicles?

Regarding "Answer: One rain universally... no need for fixed standards." "Teaching same, faculties different" etc. means the Three Vehicles taking teaching have

differences between partial and universal, therefore called "teaching same, faculties different." The Three Vehicles realizing principle have differences between complete and incomplete, therefore called "principle same, realization different." The Three Vehicles' cultivation has differences between partial and complete, therefore called "practice same, cultivation different." The Three Vehicles obtaining fruit have differences between initial and final, therefore called "fruit same, explanation different."

Regarding "Śrīmālā gathering causes... three cart fruits." "Śrīmālā gathering causes and gathering fruits" etc. - as that sūtra says: "The six sense-bases being properly for the Great Vehicle" - this explanation immediately gathers causes. "The Two Vehicles' four wisdoms are not for ultimate attainment, called 'directed toward the nirvāṇa realm'" - this immediately gathers fruits. Because Śrīmālā properly explains One Vehicle causes and fruits, manifestly it gathers practice and fruit, secretly it gathers teaching and principle. Because the Lotus properly manifests former provisional and present real, manifestly it gathers teaching and principle to make them cultivate and realize, secretly gathering practice and fruit. Due to this, One Vehicle based on reality universally gathers teaching, principle, practice, and fruit.

Regarding "Manifestly only teaching and practice... explained as same and different." "Manifestly only teaching, practice, fruit; secretly actually having four" - the Profound Commentary says: "However, in the Lotus, manifestly it gathers teaching and principle, secretly gathering practice and fruit. One rain universally moistening gathers teaching. The ox-cart and treasure location gather principle." Now in this chapter, it says "manifestly only teaching, practice, fruit." How does this contradict? Explaining: Within gathering principle, it universally includes practice and fruit. That is, using what is explained to name it principle, not necessarily suchness. This treasure cart going directly to the enlightenment site immediately gathers practice. Setting up a transformed city in the middle to reach the treasure location immediately gathers fruit. The explained

principle already pervades practice and fruit, therefore saying "secretly actually having four." "Like the Nirvāṇa Sūtra explaining same and different" means because Nirvāṇa gathers principle, practice, and fruit, that sūtra's thirty-second says: "All sentient beings equally have Buddha-nature, all same One Vehicle, same one liberation, one cause one fruit, same one sweet dew, all should attain permanence, bliss, self, and purity. This is called one taste." Explaining: "Equally having Buddha-nature" gathers principle. "One cause one fruit" gathers practice and fruit. Manifestly only principle, practice, fruit; secretly actually having four. When explaining the meaning according to the text, Nirvāṇa One Vehicle also has same and different, therefore saying "like the Nirvāṇa Sūtra explaining same and different."

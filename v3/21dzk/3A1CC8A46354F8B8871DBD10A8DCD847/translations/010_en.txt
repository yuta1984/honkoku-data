This is called expedient. It is not that something without great substance is named expedient. The Great Vehicle among the four vehicles, in relation to great capacities, is the same as the other three vehicles - because there are corresponding receptacles, the four are named real. Question: If the four correspond to the four determinate ones and are named real because they match the receptacles, then the one [vehicle] corresponds to the indeterminate and should not be expedient if it follows their nature. Answer: Looking toward their own indeterminate [nature], this is real, not expedient. Because it is formed in contrast to the four determinate natures, it is expedient, not real. However, the Lotus One Vehicle is speech following others' [intentions], while the Śrīmālā One Vehicle is speech following one's own [intention], and since the contrasts are not the same, they also do not contradict. This completes the first pair of other-speech and self-speech.

Regarding the text "Also in the Lotus assembly... therefore it is real." This is the second pair of inclusion and generation. In the Lotus Sūtra, it destroys the two [vehicles] and enters the one. "What you practice is the bodhisattva path." Saying that the nine divisions of dharma enter the Great Vehicle fundamentally - all is inclusion. Because there is only this meaning and no meaning of generation, it is said that the essence and function are narrow. The Śrīmālā Sūtra says: "Mahāyāna generates all śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and worldly and supramundane wholesome dharmas. Like the Anavatapta lake producing eight great rivers, and like all seeds depending on earth to achieve growth, thus all wholesome dharmas of śrāvakas etc. depend on the Great Vehicle to achieve increase." These various texts explain the meaning of generation. It also says: "Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas all enter the Great Vehicle. The Great Vehicle is the Buddha Vehicle" etc. This text explains the meaning of inclusion. Because the two meanings are complete, the Śrīmālā One Vehicle has the broadest essence and function. Question: If that principle is taken as vehicle, how is it generation? Answer: Like the twelve-division teachings depending on the equal flow of the dharma-realm, taking dependence and naming it birth - this is also similar. As explained in the Mahāyānasaṃgraha commentary.

Regarding the text "The Lotus One Vehicle... therefore it is real." This is the third pair of having nature and lacking nature. The predictions received in the Lotus Sūtra - the four great śrāvakas etc. - are all three cycles of those with nature. In the One Vehicle there is no text about determinate nature, those without nature, etc. receiving predictions. Therefore it says "only discussing those with nature as the basis." In the Śrīmālā Sūtra, raising four analogies, it explains the four vehicle natures. According to one interpretation, the ocean analogizes the endless birth and death of icchantikas, so that sūtra's "unlearned, non-dharmic sentient beings" refers to this. Now manifesting that nature, it says "also discussing those without nature as basis."

Regarding the text "Also the Lotus only... because it is suitable to hear." This is the fourth pair of indeterminate and determinate. That is, among the ten meanings, attracting and gathering one type, and maintaining the remainder - all are indeterminate nature. Because the Lotus One Vehicle mostly aims to attract and gather these two capacities, it says "only discussing indeterminate nature." In the Śrīmālā Sūtra, existence and non-existence are both manifest; following the general through the particular, it discusses the indeterminate in a hidden way. Therefore it says "also discussing determinate seed-nature."

Regarding the text "The Lotus clearly... both types are exhausted." This is the fifth pair of wisdom and true principle. In the Lotus Sūtra, it mostly takes wisdom as the One Vehicle's essence. Although it slightly discusses true principle in a hidden way, it is not clear. Mostly explaining wisdom, there is only the meaning of inclusion but no meaning of generation. In the Śrīmālā Sūtra, it takes true principle as the One Vehicle's essence. It does not explain wisdom. In that true principle, it completely has both meanings. Therefore it says "inclusion and generation - both types are exhausted."

Regarding the text "Although Buddha-fruit nirvāṇa... explaining the One Vehicle." This is the sixth pair of manifest and hidden. Investigating the

principle, although the Buddha-fruit's principle and wisdom are both One Vehicle, the two sūtras' explanations differ in being manifest or hidden. In the Śrīmālā assembly, properly addressing great capacities without crossing over four vehicles, explaining the principle One Vehicle, therefore it is manifest. In the Lotus Sūtra, addressing indeterminate capacities, hiding while crossing over two vehicles to explain the wisdom One Vehicle. Therefore this is hidden. Based on the above six pairs, the Compilation criticizes: If Śrīmālā takes the four vehicles as real, why does it explain about two fruit extremes, saying that four wisdom ultimates etc. are Buddha's incomplete, non-definitive explanations? Also, if the Lotus does not explain generation, why does the sūtra say "in the one Buddha Vehicle, discriminatingly explaining three"? Also, if the Lotus Sūtra only explains those with nature, why do the three herbs and two trees all receive moisture? Also, if the Lotus only explains wisdom, why does the sūtra say "this dharma dwells in dharma" etc.? If the text is already like this, by what does one prove that the Lotus's partial explanation of only wisdom is non-definitive explanation? Now examining the two sūtras, although the texts are extensive or brief, the meaning is manifest or hidden. One should investigate well and not rashly determine. Now rescuing this: The Śrīmālā Sūtra saying "four wisdom ultimates etc. are non-definitive explanations" refers to other sūtras' intention, not meaning the Śrīmālā. Because it explains two vehicles as expedient, taking four vehicles as real does not contradict principle. Also, the Lotus saying "in one Buddha Vehicle discriminatingly explaining three" - this is not the meaning of generation. Like all seeds depending on earth to achieve growth, thus all wholesome dharmas of śrāvakas etc. depend on principle and the Great Vehicle as seeds to achieve increase. These are named the meaning of generation. "Explaining three in one" etc. shows that the three vehicle causes in relation to one ultimate fruit are all one expedient means. It does not mean two causes are generated from one. Therefore the Lotus One Vehicle

has only inclusion and immediately lacks the meaning of generation. Also, that the three herbs and two trees both receive moisture - because the Lotus is fundamentally for indeterminate śrāvakas, it explains one reality, but only through conditions breaks [attachment] and explains the three herbs analogy, which is not the fundamental intention. Now based on the fundamental intention, it only discusses those with nature as basis. Therefore there is no contradiction. Also, regarding the Lotus only explaining wisdom etc., the chapter text already says "manifestly taking wisdom as One Vehicle, hiddenlt explaining suchness." Who says it does not explain true principle? However, the fundamental intention of establishing teaching is to attract indeterminate capacities and make them aspire for wisdom. Now based on the fundamental intention, judging the teaching's scope, therefore there is no contradiction.

Regarding the text "Generally explaining śrāvakas... does not violate other teachings." This explains that the Lotus One Vehicle is hidden explanation. Within this, from "generally explaining śrāvakas" to "then giving predictions to two" - this explains the hidden explanation of One Vehicle. "Based on such principle" and below generally concludes the above-explained various assembly teaching intentions. According to the Lotus commentary, it only addresses two types - responsive manifestations and indeterminate ones - because their roots are already mature, Buddha personally gives predictions. The determinate and pride-filled are immature. Therefore Buddha does not personally give [predictions]. If speaking about the present assembly, initially there were three, only excluding those heading for extinction. After the three requests, the pride-filled withdrew, and [Buddha] only gave predictions to two. Why do the pride-filled withdraw? As the sūtra says, "they departed because of Buddha's awesome virtue." The commentary notes: "When wind arises, then dust and sand naturally fly; when the sun emerges, then black and white naturally separate. This means becoming driven away without being driven away." Since extinction-bound śrāvakas do not become Buddhas, we know that only explaining One Vehicle is hidden explanation. The Compilation says: The Lotus One Vehicle universally addresses the four types - determinate and pride-filled. Although their roots are immature, later bodhisattvas will give expedient means to make them generate bodhicitta, so this is not [entirely accurate].

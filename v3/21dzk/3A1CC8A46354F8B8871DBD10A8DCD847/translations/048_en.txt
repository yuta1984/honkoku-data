All can receive, endure, contemplate, and retain. Vasubandhu's commentary says: Because faith arises within [the teaching], it says "receive." Because they receive the explained words and phrases, it says "endure." Because they can grasp meaning, it says "contemplate." Because they embrace and do not lose these two, it says "retain." The *Compilation* says: Receive, endure, contemplate, retain - these sequentially reveal faith and the three wisdoms. Though the latter three correspondences are not treatise text, following the principle there is no error. Because [they] both endure, contemplate and retain text and meaning. The sutra speaks of dharma-cloud ground according to major stages. In reality, eighth and ninth grounds also accordingly can do likewise. The present chapter master's intention is to cite text through principle, therefore saying "eighth ground bodhisattva." Raising the initial to reveal the final. Therefore "able through doctrinal explanation" means: even within one moment of one wisdom's essence, being able to grasp and understand teachings while investigating meaning is called "learning wisdom." Being able to deeply deliberate, first [considering] principle then text, is called "reflection wisdom." Within these two, what can realize and make manifest is called "cultivation wisdom." Noble wisdom is swift - within one moment of wisdom, it is doctrinally divided into three. In reality there are no separate essences. Therefore it says "able through doctrinal explanation." This is precisely the commentary's meaning. What prevents learning and reflection from also being able to eliminate and suppress? This is the chapter master's intention.

"Four: the three wisdoms, as previously analyzed": Speaking of "three wisdoms" - these are preparatory, fundamental, and subsequent-attainment wisdoms. The ancient Master Ji says: In Sarvāstivāda school and *Tattvasiddhi* treatise, though wisdom that eliminates bonds does not speak of preparatory wisdom's name, antidotal wisdom properly corresponds to preparatory wisdom among the three wisdoms, not fundamental or subsequent-attainment. In present Mahāyāna school, suppression extends through three wisdoms; elimination is not [through] preparatory [wisdom].

Question: If preparatory wisdom only suppresses and does not eliminate, why does *Abhidharma* treatise

【Lower Section】
say "preparatory practice is eliminative antidote, etc."?
Answer: Following cultivation of elimination path, gradually suppressing afflictions, therefore it is called elimination. This does not mean actual elimination. Therefore there is no contradiction.

Question: If so, eighth ground and above preparatory path etc., being precisely two wisdoms, are not elimination path.
Answer: Eighth ground and above, precisely within two wisdoms, doctrinally speaks of preparatory [practice]. Now speaking according to separate essence, since it is not elimination path, there is also no contradiction.

"*Buddha-nature Treatise* says, up to called non-arising wisdom": This is text from Vasubandhu's *Buddha-nature Treatise* fascicle three, comprehensive collection section. Therefore that text explaining extraction of ālaya says: All saṃsāra karmic results depend on ālaya-consciousness as foundation. Since [one] has not yet departed from this consciousness, karmic results are not eliminated. Within dharma-body, through two paths, since two ages are extinguished, it explains "extraction." Commentary says: Speaking of "two paths" - first is non-discriminating wisdom, able to extract and remove present falsity, able to purify dharma-body, called "exhaustion wisdom." Second is non-discriminating wisdom's subsequent wisdom, able to make future falsity never arise, perfecting dharma-body, precisely non-arising wisdom. "Extract" means purifying and extinguishing present afflictions; "remove" means perfectly eliminating future afflictions. Therefore called "extraction." Now taking the main meaning, textual sections are abbreviated. *Compilation* commentary says: According to *Consciousness-only* correct doctrine, abandoning and eliminating karmic results is in liberation path. This extraction of root consciousness depends on exhaustion and non-arising. Though *Yogācāra* etc.'s exhaustion and non-arising wisdom extend through mundane and supramundane, now according to one aspect, initially arising exhaustion wisdom is called "non-discriminating," subsequently arising non-arising is called "subsequent-attainment wisdom." [This] does not contradict various texts. Why trouble with reconciliation?

No need for reconciliation.

"This depends on eliminating confusion, up to no need for harmonization": This is precisely the chapter master's text. Depending on the time of eliminating confusion about principle and phenomena, judging these two wisdoms according to initial and final major stages means: depending on wisdom attained through exhaustion of causal collections, all are called "exhaustion wisdom." Because it is wisdom attained where future suffering results do not arise, it is called "non-arising wisdom." Because causal collections are eliminated, suffering results do not arise. True seeing path stage is present, so when true wisdom arises, causal collections are immediately eliminated. Relative seeing path stage is future, so when conventional wisdom arises, suffering results do not arise. Depending on these two stages, provisionally judging two wisdoms. Speaking of reality, both wisdoms are exhaustion and non-arising. Also "not canonical basis etc." - though this text exists in *Buddha-nature Treatise*, examining Sanskrit original, this explanation does not exist. Therefore knowing this was placed by Paramārtha, not being correct treatise text, no need for harmonization. Ancient Master Ji says: *Buddha-nature Treatise* saying "subsequent-attainment wisdom can eliminate future afflictions" - this is presumably emerging from contemplation in progressive path, distantly contemplating and blocking future afflictions, explaining "eliminating future." Not uninterrupted elimination. Extensively as explained in that master's *Saṃgraha* chapter.

"Five: four foundations of mindfulness, up to not separate characteristics": Four foundations of mindfulness means body, feelings, mind, and phenomena. All take wisdom as essence. Contemplating body's impurity, contemplating feelings' lack of pleasure, contemplating mind's impermanence, contemplating phenomena's non-self. This is the cultivation aspect. In Sarvāstivāda school, among four foundations of mindfulness, through mindfulness of phenomena, all bonds and tendencies are eliminated, not through the other three. *Saṃyuktahṛdaya* treatise says: Within cultivated wisdom, the four foundations of mindfulness are complete. That mindfulness of phenomena can eliminate afflictions because [it has] comprehensive object-sphere. Not other foundations of mindfulness, because [they have] particular object-spheres.

【Lower Section】
*Vibhāṣā* and *Abhidharmakośa* also agree with this explanation. In *Tattvasiddhi* treatise school, though the treatise does not explain individual foundations of mindfulness treating such afflictions, that treatise says "mindfulness eliminates provisional-name mental afflictions." One should know: four foundations of mindfulness all eliminate afflictions. In Mahāyāna school, only one mindfulness of phenomena can eliminate afflictions, not [the other] three foundations of mindfulness. Within mindfulness of phenomena, there is comprehensive and particular. Comprehensive means comprehensive-object intention takes comprehensive phenomena as object. Particular means particular-object intention takes particular phenomena as object. Now comprehensive-object foundations of mindfulness within mindfulness of phenomena can eliminate afflictions.

"Comprehensive-object dharma contemplation, up to creating contradiction": "Emptiness and non-self contemplation already having comprehensive-object etc." - emptiness and non-self wisdom does not merely contemplate suffering truth to eliminate afflictions below it, but also generally contemplates all phenomena, able to eliminate various afflictions. The reason for this: emptiness and non-self wisdom has two [types] - comprehensive-object and particular-object. Speaking of "comprehensive-object" - generally contemplating all phenomena, emptying two selves. Particular-object means only contemplating suffering truth, emptying the self above it. *Abhidharma* and other treatises all say "only comprehensive-object contemplation can eliminate various afflictions." Separate emptiness and non-self belong to suffering truth. If not explaining thus, only using particular emptiness and non-self above suffering truth to eliminate afflictions would contradict various treatises. Therefore it says "otherwise, only suffering creates contradiction."

Question: Using emptiness and non-self wisdom to eliminate afflictions, why does *Abhidharma* say "only non-self wisdom can eliminate afflictions etc."?
Answer: That depends on eliminating confusion about principles and general elimination to make this explanation.

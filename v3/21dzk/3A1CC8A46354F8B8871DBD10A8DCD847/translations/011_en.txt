Indeed. The extinction-bound seed-nature ultimately does not mature. Why then say "immature"? According to the chapter master's explanation, "not yet" means "no." Those heading for extinction are not ignorant about the dharma, but their faith-faculties have not yet matured. Buddha does not give predictions. Because [Buddha] does not clearly predict becoming Buddha in future lives, bodhisattvas give predictions. They give implicit predictions. Because there is inherent nature, through expedient means they are made to generate faith in the Great Vehicle. How can that matter be taken as One Vehicle benefit? Therefore we know it properly addresses two types of people.

Regarding the text "In explaining the two vehicles... because they are all two categories." Question: The pratyekabuddha teachings in the two collections are generally named the śrāvaka collection. Why don't pratyekabuddhayāna among the two vehicles generally take the name śrāvakayāna? To address this difficulty, an analogy is drawn. Counting these, there are four meanings in total. This is the first meaning. Pratyekabuddhas mostly do not rely on teachings. Although they explain dependent origination etc., they are generally included and gathered into the śrāvaka collection. However, when accomplishing practice, the two vehicles have different names. First, there is the difference between relying and not relying on teachings. Second, there is the difference between sharp and dull faculties. For this reason, pratyekabuddhayāna cannot generally take the name śrāvakayāna. They are just generally called the Small Vehicle for the two vehicles, and also generally called the Lower Vehicle. Like "lower" among root-powers, when middle is contrasted with upper, all are called lower roots - here it is also the same. Because they are contrasted with the Upper Vehicle, they are all called Lower Vehicle. Because both capacity and teaching are lower, in contrast to the Upper Vehicle they are generally called Lower Vehicle. Therefore it says "using capacity, using teaching, because they are all two categories."

Regarding the text "Also śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas... therefore named śrāvakas." This is the second meaning. The śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas whose capacities and teachings are equally lower are combined as one category and called Lower Vehicle. The meaning of this text now is that initial and final śrāvakas

【Lower Section】
are all equally the same, so by this aspect of meaning, they are combined as Lower Vehicle. That those of indeterminate nature "use the sound of the Buddha Path to make all hear" etc. means that after turning their minds, using the sound of the Buddha Path to make all hear, they are called śrāvakas. They are the Upper Vehicle, not the Lower Vehicle.

Regarding the text "Also those pratyekabuddhas... therefore not separately explained." This is the third meaning. Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have slightly different roots and practices, but equally study the teachings of emptiness of persons and attain ultimate fruit, so it says "there are not many separate teachings." Because of this similarity, they are called Lower Vehicle and Śrāvaka Vehicle. Like in the two collections, pratyekabuddhas are similar and called Śrāvaka Collection. Therefore they are combined as one vehicle and not separately explained.

Regarding the text "Also named great and small... because the categories are the same." This is the fourth meaning. Because śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are equally categories of small capacities, in contrast to bodhisattvas they are jointly called Small Vehicle. Because the categories are the same.

Regarding the text "What cause among the three... therefore also not explained." This asks about the meaning of opening and combining based on the three supramundane vehicles. "Supramundane three" means: first, bodhisattva vehicle; second, pratyekabuddha vehicle; third, śrāvaka vehicle. This combines determinate and indeterminate as three vehicles. Now questioning the reason, it says "what cause." That "among indeterminate nature some have two, some have three" etc. is the answer. Although indeterminate nature has two or has three, there are distinctions in seed-nature. However, ultimate fruit does not exceed these three. Following the general through the particular, three vehicles are generally established. Among these three vehicles, each has one-type-one-nature, three-types-two-natures, and one-type-three-natures. Because the categories of determinate and indeterminate natures are different, later generating aspiration and attaining fruit is indeterminate. What is now called "having two" is three-types-two-natures. "Having three" is one-type-three-natures

Indeed. The human and celestial vehicles are worldly vehicles and not ultimate conveyance, so they do not separately establish vehicles within the supramundane. Question: Why do the supramundane vehicles have these determinate and indeterminate types, while worldly vehicles do not have two categories? Answer: If there were determinate nature in the mundane world, humans should always be human and not be able to become celestials etc. Celestials should always be celestials and not be able to become humans etc. However, in the mundane world there are no such categories. Therefore there is no determinate nature in the mundane world.

Regarding the text "Among Śrīmālā's four... because they are equally shallow and near." This sūtra's meaning is that following the general through the particular, it does not explain the indeterminate. Because ultimately [they] are also only gathered into the three vehicles, existence and non-existence are both manifest. Therefore it establishes the natureless. Human-celestial and two vehicles are both categories of natureless and equally shallow and near, therefore jointly establishing one nature.

Regarding the text "In the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra... because they attain nirvāṇa." This sūtra's meaning is that it depends on existence, not non-existence. Also, because it is not ultimate conveyance, it does not explain the natureless. Opening the indeterminate means hearing the sūtra's excellent virtue, cultivating different expedient means, and their seed-natures having different general and particular categories. Only taking the fundamental as three vehicles. Because bodhisattva expedient means differ, they make a fourth.

Regarding the text "Why in Laṅkāvatāra... because they are shallow and near categories." The meaning of the two sūtras is that general and particular categories differ, and there are differences in seed-natures, so opening the indeterminate they make One Vehicle essence outside the three vehicles. Not separating human and celestial vehicles is because they are equally conditioned dharmas with equal roots and seeds, so they are combined as one vehicle.

Regarding the text "Elsewhere it also explains... because it does not exceed three." The previous second section says: "Also one type of five vehicles." Following the general through the particular, combining indeterminate nature. Because the destinations differ, opening human and celestial into

two. The vehicle essence has no difference. This also points to this text's meaning being the same.

Regarding the text "Not opening those with nature... the principle also has no difference." The Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, Yogācāra treatise and other sūtras and treatises only explain five seed-natures, not explaining six natures. Following various teachings, they only explain five vehicles. If receiving fruits differs and destination categories differ, then what is explained is also six. Therefore it says "even if establishing six, the principle also does not differ."

Regarding the text "However, there is no textual evidence... because there are no more categories." Although there are general texts, there is no separate listing of names like seven vehicles etc. Therefore it says "no textual evidence." "General text" refers to the Avataṃsaka Sūtra's Dharmadhātu chapter saying: "Some worlds hear the sound of one vehicle being explained, some two, three, four, five, up to immeasurable vehicles. Only wisdom and practice differ; liberation has no distinctions. Like the nature of space, there are no various characteristics." Now saying "not explaining seven etc." means there is no separate listing of names like seven vehicles etc., therefore saying "not explaining seven etc." If gathered by categories, it does not exceed five vehicles. Therefore it says "because there are no more categories."

Regarding the text "Fifth question and answer... not returning to Buddha." Manifesting the question's meaning: examining the two sūtras' texts, there is no sentient being who does not reach Buddha's ultimate fruit, so how can there be five vehicle distinctions? Then explaining One Vehicle teaching - how could this exhaust the principle? Generally questioning this meaning, it says "in this, One Vehicle's principle should be only one, without remaining two, three, etc."

Regarding the text "Answer: Mahāyānasaṃgraha... without two, three, etc." Manifesting the answer's meaning: speaking according to reality,

there is also no name 'so-and-so' in the aggregates. Transcendent persons, in accordance with their nature and characteristics, are able to know this. This is called ultimate truth." The explanation says: The meaning of this sūtra text reveals the first approach among the seven rounds of the nature-establishment school. There is no different meaning beyond this.

"Second, regarding... making the real the ultimate": This marks the second round, corresponding to the sūtra text. "Having name and reality, this being real dharma, etc." - the sūtra says: "Furthermore, good son, some dharmas have name and have reality. Or again there are dharmas that have name but lack reality. Good son, having name but lacking reality is conventional truth. Having name and having reality is ultimate truth." The explanation says: The meaning of this sūtra text reveals the second approach among the seven rounds. There is no different meaning beyond this.

"Third, regarding... making it ultimate meaning": This marks the third round, corresponding to the sūtra text. "Like self, sentient beings, etc." - the sūtra says: "Good son, like self, sentient beings, life span, cognition, nurturing, person, experiencer, agent, flames in hot weather, gandharva cities, turtle hair, rabbit horns, wheels of spinning fire, and all aggregates, elements, and entrances - these are called conventional truth. Suffering, origination, cessation, and path are called ultimate truth." The explanation says: The meaning of this sūtra text reveals the third approach among the seven rounds. There is no different meaning beyond this.

"Next, regarding... distinguishing the two truths": This second section below marks the doctrine of the nature-negating school and matches it with the sūtra's two truths. First it generally marks the school's intention, then separately corresponds to the sūtra text. This is the beginning. Regarding emptiness and existence of provisional dharmas: the five types of worldly dharmas are called "existence," and knowing them as they truly are calls them "empty." Regarding emptiness and existence of real dharmas:

【Lower Section】
aggregates, elements, entrances, etc. are called "existence," but regarding essential emptiness, in ultimate meaning, severing the names of aggregates and self is called "empty." Master Yuan says: In the second school, conventional truth has existence and non-existence. Within existence, following meanings, it divides into three types. First is phenomenal conventional truth - referring to aggregates, elements, etc. In phenomena the boundaries are the same. Being truly real and not false, it is called truth. This is the same as the conventional truth phenomena of the first school. Second is dharma-characteristic conventional truth - referring to all dharmas' suffering, impermanence, etc. Because it is the real nature of dharmas, it is called truth. This approach is the true truth dharma within the previous school. Third is principle-characteristic conventional truth - referring to dharmas' falseness, conditionality, and collective functions being truly so in worldly dharmas, called conventional truth. This approach is not the same as the previous school. What is called "non-existence": among the five aggregates, the self and person that ordinary beings falsely construct - within conventional truth dharmas, there is actually no such self, therefore called conventional truth. This emptiness and non-self: within this Abhidharma school, it is explained as ultimate truth in one direction. Within the Satyasiddhi treatise, the meaning has both aspects. If distinguishing this non-self within the five aggregates' phenomenal dharmas, it is absorbed into conventional truth. If regarding essential emptiness in ultimate meaning, when there is no self and person established by deluded emotions, this is true truth. Now regarding the first meaning, it is explained as conventional truth. Within true truth, there are distinctly two meanings. First is the emptiness of naturelessness within causal combination as true truth. Second is regarding essential emptiness in ultimate meaning - the absence of self and person established by ordinary beings as true truth. Now regarding the sūtra's meaning, temporarily opening two approaches.

"Regarding the first approach... called non-inverted": This second section below corresponds to the sūtra text. "Worldly dharmas have five, etc." - the sūtra says: "Good son, worldly dharmas have five types: first is name-world, second is phrase-world,

third is bondage-world, fourth is dharma-world, fifth is attachment-world. Up to: Good son, if there are sentient beings who, regarding such five types of worldly dharmas, have no mental inversion and know them as they truly are, this is called ultimate truth." The explanation says: The five types of worldly dharmas, being the existence of provisional dharmas, are therefore called conventional truth. The emptiness of naturelessness within causal combination and the emptiness of naturelessness within dharma combination are called true truth. Now saying "knowing their essential emptiness as not real nature is called non-inverted" means: within causal combination and dharma combination, knowing true nature's emptiness is called non-inverted.

"Regarding the latter approach... called ultimate meaning": This marks the latter approach to correspond with the sūtra text. "If burning, cutting, etc. are called conventional truth, etc." - the sūtra says: "Furthermore, good son, if there is burning, if there is cutting, if there is death, if there is destruction, this is called conventional truth. Having no burning, no cutting, no death, no destruction is called ultimate truth." The explanation says: "If burning, cutting, etc. are called conventional truth" refers to principle-characteristic conventional truth. Worldly dharmas' falseness, conditionality, and collective functions being truly so is called conventional truth. Being subject to burning, cutting, etc. is provisional, therefore not the same as the previous school's regarding essential emptiness in ultimate meaning - the absence of self and person established by ordinary beings as true truth.

"Next, regarding... as ultimate meaning": This third section below marks the doctrine of the characteristic-negating school and matches it with the sūtra's two truths. Master Yuan says: Conventional truth within the third school also has two aspects: first existence, second non-existence. Within existence, following meanings, it divides into four types. First is phenomenal characteristics - referring to aggregates, elements, etc. This is the same as the first school's

【Lower Section】
conventional truth phenomena. Second is dharma characteristics - suffering, impermanence, etc. This is the same as the first school's true truth dharma. Third is characteristics of provisional names and collective functions. This approach is the same as the principle-characteristic conventional truth within the previous two schools. Fourth is delusional imagination. The so-called principles of worldly dharmas are all the existence of delusional imagination, like mirage water. This approach is not the same as the previous schools. What is called "non-existence": following meanings there are two aspects. First is the absence of self and person falsely constructed by ordinary beings in the aggregates as conventional truth. If regarding characteristic-less ultimate meaning, the absence of self and person falsely constructed by ordinary beings is true truth. Now regarding the five aggregates' conditional dharmas, judging the absence of such self and person as entering conventional truth. However, this conventional truth is the same as the previous first school's true truth dharma. Second is regarding the five aggregates' provisional name dharmas, the absence of self-nature grasped by deluded emotions. Within conventional truth dharmas, there is actually no such nature, therefore called conventional truth. Now entering the Mahāyāna characteristic-negating school, the meaning has both aspects. If regarding the five aggregates' conditional dharmas, judging the absence of self-nature grasped by ordinary beings as belonging to conventional truth. If regarding characteristic-less ultimate meaning, the absence of such nature is true truth. Now regarding the first meaning, it is explained as conventional truth. Within true truth there are distinctly three meanings. First is ultimate delusional imagination's empty quiescence as true truth. Second is the absence of self and person falsely constructed by ordinary beings within this emptiness as true truth. Third is the absence of self-nature established by ordinary beings within this emptiness as true truth. "The characteristics of eight sufferings as conventional truth, etc." - the sūtra says: "Furthermore, good son, having the characteristics of eight sufferings is called conventional truth. Having no birth, no aging, up to no five flourishing aggregates is called ultimate truth." The explanation says: Within delusional imagination's existence, completely having eight sufferings is therefore called conventional truth. Characteristic-less

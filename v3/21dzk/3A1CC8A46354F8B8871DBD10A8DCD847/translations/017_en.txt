establishing such dharmas. Therefore called "following phenomena." Aggregates, etc. are not one, therefore called "differential." Also called provisional establishment truth means also called "realization establishment truth." Suffering, accumulation, etc. are established through realizing principle. Now saying "provisional establishment" means worldly scholars provisionally practice and study, removing evil and working for good, realizing sacred fruits. Therefore called "provisional establishment." Also called nominal establishment truth means the two-emptiness principle, depending on provisional emptiness gates, is explained as true nature. Since that true nature is the realm of inner-realization wisdom, it cannot be expressed in language, called "two-emptiness suchness," merely provisionally established. Therefore called "nominal non-establishment truth."

Regarding the text "Manifestation Treatise explains... nominal establishment": This raises a question based on Manifestation volume six text. That is, generating treatise from treatise, explaining the meaning of establishment. This question's meaning is that in the Manifestation Treatise, it says the four kinds of conventional truth are all established. Explaining the first three conventional truths as establishment, their meaning can be understood. How can the fourth two-emptiness true suchness also be called conventional establishment? "Ultimate truth nature is self-inner realization" etc. below quotes text to answer. This is precisely treatise text. "The first three kinds" below is the chapter master's text. This answer's meaning shows that perfect accomplished nature cannot be established, being self-inner realization. Only manifested by two emptiness, without separately establishing as existent, non-existent, both existent and non-existent, neither existent nor non-existent, mind and mental factors, form and sound dharmas. Only buddhas and bodhisattvas, using their own realization, guide sentient beings to generate wisdom realizing that suchness, therefore depending on conventional truth for provisional establishment. Therefore called "establishment."

Regarding the text "Ultimate truth four... establishment ultimate": Also called substance-function manifestation truth means aggregates, realms, etc. have real substantial nature, surpassing initial conventional, therefore called "ultimate." Following phenomenal differentials, explaining and naming as aggregates, etc., therefore called "manifestation." Also called cause-effect differential truth means the differentials of knowing, severing, realizing, cultivating cause and effect of suffering, accumulation, etc. surpass conventional principles, therefore called "ultimate." Also called depending-on-gate manifesting-reality truth means two-emptiness principle surpasses conventional realization, therefore called "ultimate." Depending on emptiness-capable realization to manifest reality, therefore called "depending-on-gate." Also called abandoning-explanation discussing-essence truth means the one-reality one-suchness substance is subtle, separated from words, therefore called "ultimate," surpassing conventional ultimate, again called "ultimate." Among the four ultimates, the first three are called "establishment ultimate," identical with conventional's latter three. The fourth kind is non-establishment ultimate. Therefore Manifestation says "non-establishment reality" means the true suchness real nature of all dharmas. Question: Are these Two Truths empty or existent? Explanation: Within Mahāyāna, two schools differ. First, the ultimate-all-empty school - Bhāvaviveka, etc. They clarify emptiness-explaining sūtras as definitive meaning explanations; all dharmas are conventionally existent but ultimately all empty. Second, the accordance-with-principle perfect-reality school - Dharmapāla, etc. propagate Avataṃsaka, Saṃdhinirmocana sūtras, etc. Though explaining Two Truths, following what is appropriate, they possess both emptiness and existence; principle is perfectly subtle without deficiency, truly excellent. Being confused about emptiness-existence meaning is as in the Consciousness-Only Commentary. Now preserving the second school, we present Two Truths meaning.

Regarding the text "Later explaining names... called hidden-manifest truth": "World means concealment" etc. - Ximming's explanation says: World means concealment meaning, conventional means coarse-manifest meaning. Jars, clothes, etc. are worldly coarse-manifest things that conceal ultimate

meaning, therefore called "conventional." The textual expressions differ slightly, but the meaning intention has no difference. Regarding the example of tying handkerchiefs, etc.: The original handkerchief represents emptiness; the rabbit shape appearing represents conventional existence. On the handkerchief there is originally no rabbit shape, but through conditions like hands, the rabbit shape manifests. On the principle of emptiness there are originally no forms, etc., but through the meeting of four conditions, form characteristics manifest. Therefore using this as analogy.

Regarding the text "Moreover, nature falls... dependent-master explanation": This is the second meaning. Master Yuan says: World is called time; the arising and cessation of phenomenal dharmas exists in time. Examining dharmas according to time, therefore called "conventional truth." Now saying "nature falls into arising and cessation" etc. - the meaning is also similar. Precisely carrying the four characteristics, arising and ceasing moment by moment, therefore called "nature falls into arising and cessation." "Existent as truly existent" etc. means the first level of conventional truth is called non-existent, the latter three levels of conventional are called existent. These existences and non-existences each abide in their own nature; what is explained is not false, therefore called truth. Question: Truth has real substance, so it can be explained and called truth. Conventional is false - how can it be called truth? Explanation: Calling conventional "false" is distinguishing meaning in contrast to truth. However, regarding worldly dharmas, those matters are not non-existent. Therefore they merit being called truth.

Regarding the text "Superior means excellent... reality encompasses dependent-warrior": "Realm-name-meaning" etc. - the meaning of realm encompasses both dependent-master and possessive explanations. The meaning of principle is only intrinsic-activity meaning. Regarding the fourth ultimate, various treatises mostly explain "superior is precisely meaning." Ximming says: Or again, meaning is precisely beneficial meaning. Nirvāṇa fruit is precisely superior; beneficial meaning is called "ultimate meaning." This is intrinsic-activity explanation among the six explanations. Now it is not so. According to principle meaning, clarifying intrinsic-activity meaning. Or the four ultimates are all "superior's" etc. - superior means superior

wisdom, meaning is precisely realm meaning. This encompasses both wisdoms, all called "superior wisdom." The four kinds of ultimate, following what is appropriate, are realms of both wisdoms. Precisely superior's meaning, therefore dependent-master explanation.

Regarding the text "That undefiled wisdom... realm name meaning": "Following whichever truth" means explaining according to the four truths. Precisely undefiled wisdom traversing the four levels all have possessive explanations. "Abandoning explanation discussing essence is not realm" - Question: Yogācāra seventy-two says: "Question: How are the five dharmas and four conditions mutually included? Answer: Characteristics are included in all conditions. Names are included in immediately-preceding conditions. Discrimination and correct wisdom are included in four conditions. Suchness is included only in object-condition." Since it says "suchness is included only in object-condition," how can it now say "abandoning explanation discussing essence is not realm"? Explanation: Suchness is not the realm of discriminating mind, therefore called "non-realm." This does not mean it is not the realm of correct wisdom. Therefore there is no contradiction.

Regarding the text "Truth means reality meaning... designate it as truth": "Reality meaning" etc. - according to Yogācāra fifty-five's explanation, truth has two meanings: First, like explained characteristics, non-separation meaning. Second, through observing this, arriving at ultimate completion, therefore called truth. Explaining: Adding explanation of suffering characteristics - truly real suffering that cannot be made pleasurable, up to the path eliminating suffering being truly real path that cannot make that suffering non-suffering, up to path non-path. Called "non-separation." Saying "non-separation" is precisely reality meaning. Reality meaning is called truth. "Through observing this" etc. - this precisely generates non-inverted awareness, called "truth meaning." Through separating from inversion, then arriving at ultimate completion - precisely this truth meaning. Question: If truth is precisely reality meaning, why can true and conventional both be called truth, yet cannot both be explained as true truth? Explanation

Teaching One Vehicle. It is not because sentient beings' natures have no distinctions.

Regarding the text "Question: The sūtra itself says... distinctions of three and five vehicles." The meaning of this question is: If according to the sūtra text, breaking two and breaking three to clarify One Vehicle, then in the three vehicles and five natures, there would be no determinate natures permanently, and two vehicles and three vehicles would all be what should be broken. Why now speak of "gathering three and returning to one"? Is not the Great Vehicle among the three what should be broken? Kumārājīva and other ancient masters all raised this question.

"Answer: If according to the Sanskrit text... not true breaking." From here below answers the question extensively. Within this, first [discusses] that master's doctrine of gathering three and returning to one, then breaks the doctrine of masters who cling to Buddha and teach One Vehicle. This is the first. Kumārājīva and others said: "No two" means no śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. "No three" means no śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who practice the six perfections one-sidedly in the Great Vehicle for individual benefit. Now this doctrine is broken. The chapter master explains: Counting from superior to inferior, Buddha is first, pratyekabuddhas second, śrāvakas third. Saying "no two, no three" means no second pratyekabuddhas and no third śrāvakas either, not that there is no Great Vehicle essence among the three vehicles. Examining the Sanskrit text, it says "no second, no third." In translating this now, only the character "number" is not placed. There is difficulty with this, saying: Among the eight intentions, regarding the ultimate, there is only the Buddha Vehicle, therefore it is called "no two, also no three." It is not that there are no determinate two vehicles. One could also say "there is only the formless realm, no desire and form realms." If this were so, it would contradict logical inference. The inference says: The natures of the three realms have determinate and indeterminate (thesis), because of beginningless natural law (reason), like the three vehicle natures (example). The three vehicle natures are all indeterminate (thesis), because of beginningless natural law (reason),

Like the three realm natures (example). Explaining: If one clings to the formless as ultimate, this too would be broken likewise. Because among the three realms there are also no three ultimates, without reconciling and breaking. However, in the theses of both inferences, there is the fault of partial agreement. Because one also allows that three realm natures are indeterminate, and also allows that within indeterminate bodies there are three vehicle natures. There is also questioning and answering about natures, as explained in the Commentary.

Regarding the text "The Lotus itself says... not what should be broken." Master Kumārājīva and others said: Hearing that three were taught in the past, they cling to all three as ultimate. Now teaching that one is ultimate, therefore breaking the clinging to three. Because this arises from bodhisattvas before the grounds. Now this master's doctrine is broken. The two vehicles do not know that two is expedient means, clinging to two vehicle fruits as truly ultimate. Now explaining the two nirvāṇas is only for the sake of the transformed city, explaining the two bodhis is only goat and deer vehicles, taught by provisional teachings. Now breaking their emotional clinging that there are ultimate two fruits, therefore teaching one. If breaking clinging to the Great as ultimate, it would again teach One Vehicle, further increasing that disease. What would be called breaking? If breaking three, why then say "the other two are not real, etc."? Therefore we know the Great Vehicle is not what should be broken.

Regarding the text "That sūtra also says... how much more the Great Vehicle." What is called "the second etc." - the Sanskrit text fully says "second and third." In just translating this, it is abbreviated without the character "number." By this one clearly knows: only breaking the two vehicles, not breaking the Great Vehicle. "The śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha vehicles are the Great Vehicle, etc." is text from that sūtra's "Entering the One Vehicle Chapter." Master Xiao says: The various practices cultivated by the two vehicles and others do not go beyond bodhisattva Great Vehicle practices. Therefore it says "this is the Great Vehicle." Also, the Great Vehicle practice virtues of bodhisattvas

do not go beyond Tathāgata practice virtues. Therefore it says "the Great Vehicle is the One Vehicle." The chapter master's present intention: By gathering one category of indeterminate two vehicles, therefore says "two vehicles are the Great Vehicle." And by gathering the remaining indeterminate bodhisattvas, therefore says "the Great Vehicle is the One Vehicle." Still not gathering determinate two vehicles, how much more determinate bodhisattvas? Therefore says "how much more the Great Vehicle."

Regarding the text "Also no three vehicles... how does this principle err?" The meaning of this doctrine's explanation: To manifest the one meaning, generally says "no three." It does not break the Great Vehicle nature among the three. Because there is separately One Vehicle, it is called "no three." Also "no three vehicles" means using the one fruit to distinguish the three causes. There are two distinctions: one is principle distinguishing teaching, two is fruit distinguishing cause. Due to these two meanings, therefore it is called "no three." Therefore there is no error.

Regarding the text "If gathering and breaking three... does this become gradual awakening?" The meaning of this objection: If gathering and breaking three, previously when not yet having left the house, promising with ox carts, already also breaking the great, after leaving the house, what kind of cart is given? If saying "giving white oxen and discarding the original yellow oxen, therefore the two oxen are different," then the great among three, being sudden awakening, gathered to enter one, should accordingly discard sudden and have them learn gradual awakening.

Regarding the text "Also Great Vehicle one... breaking three returning to one." "How do the understanding and practice of Great Vehicle and One Vehicle differ?" etc. - Understanding means awakening comprehension. Practice means causal practice. Awakening and entering Great Vehicle understanding and awakening and entering One Vehicle understanding - what difference is there between these two understandings? Great Vehicle and One Vehicle both encompass cause and effect. What difference is there between those two causal practices? The Profound Commentary says: How do the characteristics of yellow and white oxen, causal

practice differ? Already returning to the original ox, clearly not breaking the great. If clinging to one as ultimate does not violate approaching the great, why need to break it? Clinging to two as ultimate, not approaching the great, therefore should be broken. Now this is the same. "This is discarding the lower and approaching the upper stage" etc.: If rescuing this by saying "newly aspiring bodhisattvas etc. according to their position, immediately cling to it as ultimate," this then teaches one to remove their doubting attachment. By this they discard lower positions and approach upper stages, not discarding the Great Vehicle to enter one. We do not see this attachment existing in the cause of approaching the Great Vehicle. If not so, the ten grounds discarding lower and approaching higher should all also be called breaking three returning to one. Even if so allowing also breaking, it should become endless breaking. Master Xuanlong says: The Tripiṭaka master's explanation: Great Vehicle and One Vehicle differ in language but have the same meaning. Saying "Great Vehicle" is the name in contrast to the small. Saying "One Vehicle" is the name in contrast to the fruit. Now also agrees with this.

Regarding the text "Also should say... not true principle." Citing the Śrīmālā text has two meanings. First, the text only says "there are no two vehicles," not saying "three vehicles." Therefore we know it does not gather the Great Vehicle. Second, already saying "taught as expedient means," not saying "ultimate truth," clearly knowing it gathers indeterminate natures, not gathering determinate two vehicles. Therefore says "expedient means."

Regarding the text "Though the sūtra explains... there is one name of truth." "This is an expedient gateway, distantly causing entry into truth" means encompassing distant and indirect meaning. That is, in the past teaching that there are two vehicle fruits etc., causing approach to ultimate fruit truth

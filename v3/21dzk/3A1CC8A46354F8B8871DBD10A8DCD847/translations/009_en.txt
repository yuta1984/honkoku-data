Since the text already explains "causing all indeterminate-nature śrāvakas to generate this mind," it is clearly known that the chapter master also has distinctions.

Regarding the text "Through hundreds of thousands of kalpas... to nirvāṇa." This is where the chapter master quotes other sūtra texts to repeatedly explain the characteristics of responsive manifestation. The second edition of the Mahāyānasaṃgraha completely lacks this text. The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra in ten fascicles, fascicle nine, general chapter verse says: "Attaining extinction samādhi, not awakening for immeasurable kalpas - this is the concentration of śrāvakas, not of my bodhisattvas. Like being free from various secondary afflictions, depending on the bondage of habitual afflictions, intoxicated by the pleasant realm of samādhi, dwelling in that uncontaminated realm, like worldly people intoxicated by wine, awakening after it dissipates. That person also thus later attains my Buddha-dharma body." Extensively as explained there. Now this compilation and that text, in explaining the characteristics of responsive manifestation, seem somewhat different, but their meanings are mutually very similar. Scholars should collate them.

Regarding the text "Ten, because of ultimacy... most supreme." This is the eighth ultimate intention. Vasubandhu's commentary says: "Only this One Vehicle is most ultimate. Beyond this there are no other superior vehicles. In śrāvaka vehicles etc. there are other superior vehicles, namely the Buddha Vehicle. Through this intention, all Buddha-bhagavats proclaim the One Vehicle." The Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṃkāra says: "Because of ultimacy" means reaching the Buddha-essence with no further place to go, therefore the One Vehicle is explained. Thus, throughout various sūtras, with these eight intentions, Buddha explains the One Vehicle. This also does not mean there are no Three Vehicles. Explanation: These eight intentions generally show the explanation of One Vehicle throughout various places. Saying there are separate intentions, not all are as the text [literally states]. Therefore this is hidden intention. The first two intentions separately show that the eight intentions

are for encompassing two types. Because the recipients are distinguished, the One Vehicle is not hidden, they say. Therefore the old commentary says: "The previous verse explains One Vehicle with definitive meaning; the later verse explains One Vehicle with hidden meaning."

Regarding the text "In the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka commentary... becoming Buddha is called one." This is the chapter master's text. Saying "first, second, and small part of the eighth" - within the eighth intention, taking indeterminate śrāvakas who properly receive prediction, not taking bodhisattvas who receive prediction with the same name. Therefore it is called a small part. The remaining six types' small parts explain One Vehicle through separate meanings - some editions say "remaining eight types." If following that statement, completely speaking, one could say "remaining seven types, eighth small part." The Compilation says: The chapter master's commentary says "the remaining is the first two among ten, and the eighth small part," while the sūtra commentary says "responsive manifestation is the ninth meaning and remaining small parts." Meaning, completely taking the ninth and small parts among the remaining seven. This commentary has no problem. If saying "remaining eight," since the ninth is completely taken, the remainder has only seven. Why say eight? Therefore, following this commentary, the principle probably is not so. Now rescuing this: Examining various chapter editions, most editions all say "responsive manifestation is the ninth," not saying "remaining eight small parts." How can one add remaining text and create empty difficulties? He further objects: "Also the sixth intention is properly indeterminate yet not taken. Why not take the indeterminate sixth etc." And so on. Self-describing the correct [view]: "The eight intentions' explanation is One Vehicle, all for two types - namely indeterminate-nature śrāvakas and bodhisattvas. The first two show those who are recipients; the latter eight show their intentions. Therefore the Sūtrālaṃkāra says: 'For the two indeterminate types, all Buddhas explain One Vehicle.' Therefore we know the eight intentions each and all penetrate for the two types." Now rescuing this: The reason for not taking the sixth despite being indeterminate is properly

speaking about prediction, so it is not taken. If so, one should also not take the second, because this assembly does not explain bodhisattva prediction. Explanation: There are two [types of] indeterminate. First, those who have already practiced great practices but wish to retreat from them. Second, those who although having great nature, have never practiced the great. The first is the second [intention]; the latter is the sixth. The Lotus Sūtra's fundamental intention is properly for the second. Therefore excluding the sixth. Now only taking the first two, [regarding] the eight - using the remaining ones, regarding separate meanings, clarifying the One Vehicle. Since they are not equally indeterminate, they are not taken.

Regarding the text "Pravṛtti-vijñāna twenty... no need for separate explanation." Some editions lack this text. This can be known through collation. The mutual encompassing and corresponding arrangement of six causes and ten meanings is as before. The first is the increase-decrease gate.

Regarding the text "However, the Lotus Sūtra... takes vehicles as real." Below this, briefly depending on six pairs, it shows the differences in how the two sūtras explain One Vehicle. This is the first pair of other-speech and self-speech. Within this, first briefly quoting texts to manifest their expedient-real [nature], then properly contrasting with bodhisattvas to distinguish their differences. This is first quoting Lotus Sūtra text. Examining Lotus Sūtra fascicle four: "All bodhisattvas' anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi all belong to this sūtra" and so on. "Opening the gate of expedient means, showing real characteristics" etc. Explanation: In great bodhi dharma, there are causes and effects. There are near direct causes and distant indirect causes. "Opening the gate of expedient means" encompasses the distant and indirect. Formerly explaining Two Vehicle teachings, principles, practices, and fruits. "Manifesting real characteristics" encompasses the near and direct. Now explaining One Vehicle teachings, principles, practices, and fruits. Whether distant or near, the wisdom-characteristics and wisdom-nature of teachings, principles, practices, and fruits - the five types of wisdom all belong to this sūtra. These causes and effects cannot be overcome except by Buddha. Now for bodhisattvas, opening and showing their source. Therefore saying "opening the gate of expedient means, showing real characteristics." "Taking Two Vehicles as expedient means" etc. is the chapter master's text, immediately explaining and completing the sūtra text. In the Lotus assembly, to attract the indeterminate, contrasting with distant indirect causes, One Vehicle is taken as real. If thoroughly investigating principle, the Lotus One Vehicle is expedient, not real. The reason for this: In the Śrīmālā assembly, pointing to the Lotus intention, it says "expediently explaining the existence of One Vehicle." If so, by what is it encompassed in the third period? Regarding this meaning, effort should be applied.

Regarding the text "According to the Śrīmālā Sūtra... because of not becoming Buddha." This later quotes Śrīmālā text to prove that the Lotus One Vehicle is expedient. That sūtra explaining "entering One Vehicle" is the chapter text. Following their intentions and desires, explaining one without two, like the Lotus etc. Following indeterminate intentions, explaining one without two. Śrīmālā reconciles this saying it is expedient explanation. Saying "following their intentions and desires, yet expediently explaining" etc. Now the intention of quoting text: the Lotus Sūtra etc. explaining One Vehicle is speech following others' [intentions]. Because it is suitable for them to hear. This is expedient explanation, not for [the sake of] reality. The reason: determinate-nature Two Vehicle practitioners and those without [Buddha-]nature do not become Buddhas.

Regarding the text "The Lotus assembly... also does not contradict." This properly explains differences through contrast. The Lotus mostly aims to attract and gather the indeterminate, manifesting one as real, explaining two as expedient means. Śrīmālā's principle thoroughly penetrates and provides for all capacities, distinguishing four as real, clarifying one as expedient means. The reason: only explaining One Vehicle, not establishing other vehicles. This is Buddha's expedient explanation. Naming this

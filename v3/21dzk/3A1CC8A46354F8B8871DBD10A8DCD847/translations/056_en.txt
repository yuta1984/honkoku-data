[This is] liberation. The first two eliminate seeds; the last one removes habitual tendencies. One says: The three minds each have uninterrupted and liberation [paths]. Therefore Master Zhizhou says: "Within true seeing path, [some] explain three minds or two minds' instants. 'Two' means uninterrupted and liberation; 'three' means uninterrupted, liberation, and victorious advancement." Therefore the *Vijñānavāda* says: "Because the aspirational minds for eliminating delusions and realizing cessation are different." Another explanation says: "The three minds all become uninterrupted [paths], and there should additionally be a fourth liberation path." Regarding these various explanations, [they are] as explained in separate records.

"Within those six consciousnesses... without before and after": This meaning immediately clarifies innate cognitive [obstacles] afterward. "Not functioning through others' power" means when depending on six-aspect wisdom to subdue afflictions, the cognitive [obstacles] that function together with those afflictions can also be said to be subdued. Because others' afflictive power does not manifest, those accompanying cognitive [obstacles] also do not manifest. Therefore [they] can be said to be subdued. This does not mean six aspects can subdue cognitive [obstacles], but merely that by harming companions, [they] do not arise by themselves. "Not distinguishing coarse and subtle, etc." means not separately eliminating according to realms and grounds in coarse-subtle sequence. Not abandoning the fact that the first ground eliminates subtle [afflictions] of the Peak of Existence while the second ground returns to eliminate coarse [afflictions] of the desire realm [occurs] merely because [they] eliminate whatever obstructs this ground.

"Those seven consciousnesses... eliminating manifest [afflictions], etc.": This is the second [section] clarifying the seventh consciousness. Those who explain nine grades [do so] because each of the nine grounds has nine grades. Those who explain no grades [do so because] these seventh consciousness afflictions have no nine grades within their own ground, resembling the ninth-grade self-view within the six consciousnesses of their own ground. These two masters both equally permit saying "[they] are still eliminated as one grade." Because [they] are permanently eliminated within vajra-mind.

If distinguishing according to the ten grounds, those seventh consciousnesses from the eighth ground onward can also arise. When the sixth consciousness enters personal emptiness, because that seventh consciousness is precisely defiled, obstacles can therefore arise. When entering dharma emptiness, because that seventh consciousness immediately arises equally, [they] do not arise together.

"Although the *Nirākāra-śāstra*... cannot be relied upon": Below [the text] raises two passages to reconcile contradictions. This is the first *Nirākāra-śāstra* passage. "Second grasping consciousness" refers to the seventh consciousness. Among mind, mentality, and consciousness, [it] is precisely the second mentality, hence named "second." Because [it] constantly grasps self internally, [it is] named "grasping consciousness." Ancient Master Ji cited the *Nirākāra-śāstra* saying: "If seeing truth, complete afflictive consciousness and mental factors attain supramundane path's sixteen aspects and are ultimately extinguished. The remaining residue is not yet exhausted but only belongs to contemplation. This is called the second grasping consciousness." Explaining: "Complete afflictions" are precisely seeing delusions. "Contemplation" refers to cultivation delusions. Challenging based on this text: If seventh [consciousness] afflictions are eliminated only at vajra [stage], why does the *Nirākāra-śāstra* say [they] extend to what is eliminated by seeing and cultivation? Therefore now reconciling: That *nirākāra* text already contradicts other treatises. The various masters of *Mahāyānasaṃgraha*, *Vijñānavāda*, etc., all say "the seventh consciousness is eliminated only by cultivation," therefore [it] cannot be relied upon.

"The *Benevolent King Sūtra* says... mind's habitual afflictions": This next passage is precisely from the Bodhisattva Teaching Chapter of the upper volume of the *Benevolent King Sūtra*. Master Zang's commentary says: "The first, second, and third grounds should contemplate mind-truth as signless, not grasping and clinging to material dharmas, therefore departing from material bondage. Reasonably, [they] should also contemplate mind-truth as unborn. The text's hidden and manifest [aspects] are explained following the majority. The fourth, fifth, and sixth grounds can contemplate the unborn mind-truth of the three realms,

not taking mental conceptualization, therefore capable of eliminating mind-deluding afflictions. Generally speaking, [they] should also eliminate material-deluding afflictions. The seventh, eighth, and ninth grounds deeply realize the unborn [nature] of mind and matter, therefore capable of eliminating habitual [tendencies] of matter, mind, etc. The tenth ground and Buddha ground deeply contemplate the truth of emptiness, eliminating mental habitual [tendencies] within the ultimate path. Reasonably, [they] should also eliminate material habitual [tendencies]." Challenging based on this sūtra passage: If seventh [consciousness] afflictions are eliminated only at vajra [stage], why does the *Benevolent King Sūtra* say the fourth, fifth, and sixth grounds eliminate mental afflictions? Because seventh consciousness afflictions are precisely mental afflictions.

"Matter is coarse, mind is subtle... also not contradictory": This correctly reconciles the sūtra. Material dharmas are coarse and manifest; delusions are also coarse. Mental dharmas are subtle; delusions are also subtle. Taking this coarse-subtle distinction, [the sūtra] explains eliminating afflictions by explaining the differences in the five patience stages' gradations. [This] does not mean there are separately existing seventh consciousness afflictions that obstruct the fourth, fifth, and sixth grounds, therefore eliminating mental afflictions. Hence [there is] no contradiction. The five patience [stages] are as explained in the previous first volume.

"Eighth [consciousness] dependent obstacles... small portion of cognitive obstacles": Regarding "Two vehicle [practitioners] eliminate afflictive obstacles, etc.": In the Sarvāstivāda school, among afflictive obstacles, the five views and doubt are eliminated by the seeing path; greed, hatred, delusion, and pride penetrate through both eliminations. Greed, etc., that delude about principles are eliminated by the seeing path; greed, etc., that obstruct phenomena are eliminated by the cultivation path. Two vehicle people merely extinguish afflictions but have not yet removed cognitive obstacles. Only the Buddha Tathāgata extinguishes those cognitive obstacles. The *Saṃyuktābhidharmahṛdaya* says: "Buddha removes undefiled sweating ignorance." Also the *Abhidharmakośa* says: "Cognitive obstacles are eternal-time obstacles." Now saying "permanently eliminate small portions of cognitive obstacles" refers to ignorance such as concentration obstacles and faculties obstacles. Question: Do two vehicle people eliminate faculties-obstacle ignorance and attain non-analytical cessation? Explaining: Only at the stage where superior conditions are ultimate and [one] permanently lacks them does [one] attain non-analytical [cessation]. Two vehicle people only eliminate small portions, not yet eliminating complete portions. Therefore [they] do not attain [it]. Only the Buddha World-Honored One ultimately eliminates [them] completely, therefore attains non-analytical [cessation].

Question: If so, *Abhidharmakośa* twenty-seven says: "Perfect virtues of elimination are established as four types: first, elimination of all afflictions; second, elimination of all concentration obstacles; third, ultimate elimination; fourth, elimination including habitual [tendencies]." Master Guang says: "According to that treatise's text, if all afflictive obstacle elimination attains analytical cessation, if undefiled ignorance concentration obstacle elimination attains non-analytical cessation. Having eliminated the previous two obstacles without regression is called ultimate elimination, extending to both analytical cessation and non-analytical cessation. This distinguishes dull faculties." Since [it] says distinguishing different from dull faculties, [we] clearly know sharp faculty two vehicle [practitioners] eliminate undefiled ignorance and attain non-analytical cessation. Explaining: Within ultimate elimination, dull faculties have regression; sharp faculties do not regress. Because of this difference [it is] called distinguishing dull faculties, not that sharp faculty two vehicle [practitioners] eliminate undefiled ignorance and attain non-analytical cessation. Therefore [there is] no contradiction. [One] should examine the commentary text.

"However, there are distinctions... nine grounds indefinite": Among eliminating afflictive obstacles to attain four fruits, there are distinctions of types between sequential and transcendent. Therefore [it] says "however, there are distinctions." Among the previous three fruits, each has two types: first, sequentially attaining fruits; second, transcendently attaining fruits. In this text passage, [it] precisely clarifies sequentially attaining fruits. "Gradual first fruit only eliminates three realms' discriminative afflictions": The *Disclosure of the Sacred Teaching* explains that if explaining according to the superior, [one] permanently eliminates three fetters; if complete inclusion, [one] permanently eliminates all seeing-eliminated delusions. Now because [it] concerns complete inclusion, [it] says "only eliminates three realms' discriminative afflictions." In once-returner fruit, if sequential, [one] advances from stream-enterer fruit, eliminates the sixth grade afflictions of the desire realm, and at the time of liberation path immediately attains [the fruit].

Two truths. Among the seven rounds, the first three are two truths of the nature-establishing school, the next two are two truths of the nature-breaking school, the next one is two truths of the characteristic-breaking school, and the last one is two truths of the reality-revealing school. Here now, using the profound to include the shallow, therefore discussing all of them in detail. Details are as explained below. Now the chapter master says: These seven rounds here only clarify the two truths within the reality-revealing school, not explaining Hinayana and characteristic-breaking two truths. Because reality-revealing itself has characteristic-breaking. Now this first round raises shallow phenomenal dharmas to explain the meaning of establishing two truths depending on persons. The following six rounds are established in opposition depending on the superiority and inferiority of dharmas. How can we know this? Because the first round repeatedly explains the meaning of establishing two truths depending on persons as before. The sūtra text already says: "Ordinary beings follow what they call conventional truth. Transcendent people, according to nature and characteristics, are able to know it, called ultimate meaning." Therefore we know this is merely repeatedly revealing the previous meaning, making known that two truths are established depending on mutual dependence. This should be understood when reaching below.

"Furthermore, good son... ultimate truth": This second round explains two truths through having names and having reality, etc. Having names without reality is conventional, like bottles and clothes. Having names and reality is ultimate, like form and sound. According to the chapter master's explanation, though not clearly differentiating and discriminating, reasoning through meaning shows this is the fourfold within this. Now this text saying "having names without reality is conventional truth" refers to this initial conventional, because self and existing nature etc. have names but no reality. "Having names and reality called ultimate meaning" refers to the four kinds of ultimate mentioned in treatises, all having names and essence. Or only calling the three categories ultimate meaning, because when contrasted with self etc., they have names and essence.

"Good son like... ultimate truth": This third round explains regarding self etc. "Like self, sentient beings up to the aggregates, realms, and sense-fields are called conventional truth. The four truths are ultimate meaning." Regarding self etc. without essence and the three categories with essence, these two types are both called conventional when contrasted with the principle of four truths.

Question: In the previous second round, self and sentient beings etc. having names without reality were called conventional truth in contrast to the three categories of dharmas. Why now in this third round are self etc. without essence repeatedly explained as conventional truth?

Answer: To show that dharmas of self etc. are not only called conventional when contrasted with the three categories of dharmas, but also called conventional when contrasted with the four truths etc. Therefore in the previous second round, using dharmas initially having names but no substantial function, when contrasted with aggregates, realms, and sense-fields, the dharmas of aggregates, realms, and sense-fields were called ultimate truth, included in the first ultimate among the four ultimates. To show this is not only ultimate, therefore again using the three categories when contrasted with the four truths, since phenomena are inferior to principle, they become conventional. This is the second conventional in treatises. The four truths are the second ultimate. Sentient beings, lifespan up to experiencers and agents are all different names for self. Gandharva city is called "fragrance-seeking city." Western entertainers are called fragrance-seekers. Not engaging in productive work, only seeking and eating fragrances, then making music. Waiting for them to beg. This magical city's towers and pavilions being lovable is called fragrance-seeking city. Water vapor in the sea, where sunlight reaches, seen from afar is difficult to distinguish, also resembling a magical city. Water churning makes sounds, faintly similar to making music, resembling that fragrance-seeking city. Therefore also called fragrance-seeking city. Because it creates delusion. Now using this as

an analogy. As explained in the Vimalakīrti Commentary, volume three.

"Good son world... ultimate truth": This fourth round explains regarding worldly dharmas. First clarifying five kinds of world, then below "Good son if there are sentient beings," distinguishing non-inversion. This can be understood from the text. Having five worldly dharmas as conventional, knowing this is called ultimate, shows that initial conventional is not only self etc. merely having names without substantial function dharmas. Because showing that dharmas without substantial essence but having function are also initial conventional. Therefore Xianyang etc. explains that houses, armies, forests etc. are also initial conventional. Because they are the same as the class of self etc. without substantial essence, being most base and inferior. Knowing this without inversion means there are only aggregates etc., completely without real names, sentences and other dharmas - this is ultimate meaning. Among the four ultimates, none have the explained five worldly dharmas. Or within the three categories, truly not having these five. Dasheng Ji says: This round appears to explain things not in sequence. Because having explained that aggregates, realms, and sense-fields penetrate to ultimate, fearing these dharmas having function but no essence might also penetrate ultimate truth, wanting to show this is not so, therefore explaining their doubts. So now explaining: Among the five kinds of world, the first two are designators, the next two are designated, the last one is characteristic-marking. Showing that designators and designated, whether mental or phenomenal, all have only provisional establishment, not reality. Therefore making differential explanations only, with no other meanings.

"Furthermore good son... ultimate truth": This fifth round explains regarding burning etc. "If burning, cutting etc. are called conventional truth etc." - this pair shows calling two selflessnesses conventional and one real suchness ultimate truth. Heretics and ordinary beings grasp self as permanent

and one. Buddha explains it as non-existent. Because the five aggregates etc. can be burned, cut etc., lacking the characteristics of one permanent real self. Burning, cutting etc. means two selflessnesses. In later rounds, using this selflessness contrasted with the principle of suffering truth etc. is called ultimate truth - the third ultimate. Now this fifth round uses two selflessnesses contrasted with one real suchness. Because suchness is not revealed depending on designating gates like being burnable, cuttable etc. This is ultimate of ultimates. Therefore two selflessnesses etc., if depending on designation to reveal reality, are called conventional, included in fourth ultimate conventional. Otherwise, what principle would these words designate? Because the World-honored One does not speak meaningless words. One real suchness is the fourth ultimate of ultimates.

"Furthermore good son... ultimate truth": This sixth round explains regarding having suffering and no suffering. "Having eight suffering characteristics called conventional truth etc." - previously using four truths contrasted with aggregates etc. was called ultimate, now using this contrasted with dharmas of two selflessnesses etc. lacking eight suffering characteristics becomes conventional. Included in third realization conventional. Eight sufferings are the principle of suffering truth, so specifically raising one suffering to categorize the other three truths. The chapter master explains: This round should be explained in the fifth round. The previous fifth round should be explained in the sixth. The reason for this is that these seven rounds explain two truths characteristics from shallow to deep. Now observing the sūtra text, the previous fifth round marks fourth conventional and fourth ultimate, this sixth round manifests third conventional and third ultimate. First deep then shallow, therefore the sequence is confused. Now for verbal convenience,

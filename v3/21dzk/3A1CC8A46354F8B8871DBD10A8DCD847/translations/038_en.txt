He played the zither, considering that there was no one in the world who knew music. "Exhausting Bian He's jade disc" - The *Records of the Grand Historian* says: "Bian He, a person from Jingli in the state of Chu, obtained a jade stone in Kunlun Valley of Mount Jing and presented it to King Li. The king said 'It's just a stone,' and considering that He had deceived him, cut off his right foot. When King Li died and his son King Wu ascended the throne, He again presented it. King Wu said 'It's just a stone' and immediately cut off his left foot. Unable to bear this injustice, He embraced the jade stone and wept at the foot of Mount Jing. When his tears were exhausted, he continued with blood. Mount Jing collapsed. When King Wu died and his son King Cheng ascended the throne, He again presented it. King Cheng had craftsmen examine it, and indeed obtained a luminous jade disc." Therefore, Xie Huilian's poem says: "If you plant orchids, don't face the gate; if you carry jade, don't go toward Chu. Chu has no one who can distinguish jade, and gates are not places for planting orchids." Regarding this story of Bian He, different accounts are not singular. Extensively as explained in *Qinlou Poems*, *Han Records*, *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Annotated Thousand Character Classic*, etc.

　　　Eliminating Obstacles Chapter

"From 'First, explanation of names' to 'question and answer distinctions'": Examining the compilation, among these ten sections, sections five and six are incorporated into the fourth section, further opening two sections to become sections five and six. First is the section on stages of elimination, second is the section on distinctions in attaining results. The remaining sections are the same. Extensively as explained there. "Distinctions based on consciousness, etc." refers to six consciousnesses, eight consciousnesses, etc. "Based on paths" refers to the four paths of preparation, etc. "Based on contemplations" refers to consciousness-only, two emptiness contemplations, etc. "Based on practices" refers to the three practices of emptiness, signlessness, etc., the six practices of suffering, coarseness, etc., and the sixteen practices of the Four Noble Truths, etc. "Based on categories" refers to nine categories of realms and stages, etc. "Based on obstacles" refers to two obstacles, three obstacles. "What is depended upon" refers to dependent body-stages, etc.

"From 'First, explanation of names' to 'therefore establishing the name obstacle'": Cognitive obstacles - in Sanskrit called "jñeya," translated as "knowable." "Kleśa" is translated as "afflictions." "Āvaraṇa" is translated as "obstacle." "Vexation" has the meaning of disturbance. "Affliction" has the meaning of confusion. Because they disturb sentient beings and don't allow them to escape from the ocean of suffering in birth and death, they're called "afflictive obstacles." "Cognitive obstacles" means all dharmas, whether existent or non-existent, are all knowable. Because dharma-attachment types cover the knowable, preventing wisdom from arising, they're called "cognitive obstacles." According to the six compound interpretations, as explained in fascicle nine of the *Consciousness-Only Commentary*. Question: What difference exists between the two meanings of covering and obstructing? Are knowables called "covering" and afflictions called "obstructing"? Explaining: Some say the meaning of covering applies to both, while the meaning of obstructing exists only in afflictions. The reason is that obstruction means impediment - restraining and impeding sentient beings, causing them to remain in birth and death, which exists only in afflictions. Therefore the two meanings differ. I think this is incorrect, because the two meanings are mutually applicable. Master Zhizhou says: "These same afflictions cover and conceal nirvana, preventing attainment of liberation, called 'afflictive obstacles.' They impede the capable mind, preventing the mind from understanding objects, called 'cognitive obstacles.'" Speaking according to reality, both obstacles obstruct both results. That Master Zhou assists the chapter master, therefore citing this as evidence. Regarding "obstructing great nirvana, etc.": Question: What nirvana is great nirvana? If it's non-abiding, it should be attained by eliminating cognitive [obstacles]. Why does the text say "afflictive obstacles obstruct great nirvana"? If it's with-remainder, etc., that cessation isn't great. How can it now say "obstructing great nirvana"? Explaining: The four types of nirvana realized by the Tathāgata are all called great. Though abiding in the two cessations, the functions of wisdom and compassion constantly operate without rest. Therefore they're comprehensively called great. Therefore fascicle nine of the treatise says: "By transforming afflictions, one attains great nirvana. By transforming cognitive obstacles, one realizes supreme awakening." Question: How do we know all four are called great? Explaining: Commentary fascicle one says: "Also, though the two vehicles attain the two cessations and abide in these two, it's not for non-abiding. Liberation isn't true." Up to "because there is what is manifested by with-remainder and without-remainder cessation." Extensively as explained there.

"From 'Elimination means non-continuation' to 'this is possessive compound'": Below explains the meaning of elimination. There are namely three explanations. This is the first explanation. It establishes the name "elimination" based on what is eliminated. "By the untainted path eliminating those seeds, etc." - regarding elimination there are two aspects. First, eliminating seeds etc., making them permanently without remainder. Second, merely subduing the power of seeds, making them decline and not generate present delusions. If eliminating those seeds, only untainted wisdom suffices. If making power decline, both tainted and untainted wisdoms are obtained. Now saying "meaning of non-continuation" namely applies to both of these. According to tradition, if following this text, only seeds are called eliminated, only present [afflictions] are called subdued. Then self-examining in detail: However, now it's not so. The names elimination and subduing both apply to seeds and present [afflictions]. Extensively as in that record. I think this is incorrect. Taking the chapter master's meaning and making it one's own meaning instead - how could the chapter master's intention not also call present [afflictions] elimination? Therefore the tenth section says: "If subduing elimination, it breaks the power of seeds, preventing generation of present [afflictions], called subduing present activity, etc." Since it says "present [afflictions] are also called elimination," we therefore know that the names elimination and subduing mutually apply to present [afflictions] and seeds. However, this text's "eliminating those seeds, etc." particularly raises correct elimination, not discussing subdued elimination. Therefore there's no contradiction.

"From 'Another explanation of elimination' to 'possessive compound'": This is the second explanation. Namely based on what eliminates, establishing the name elimination. "Meaning of removing and destroying" - tainted and untainted paths are what removes and destroys. Present [afflictions] and seeds of the two obstacles are what is removed and destroyed. Now taking what eliminates and distinguishing from what is eliminated, therefore saying "what eliminates is called elimination." Question: What difference exists between the two meanings of removing and destroying? Are seeds called removing and present activity called destroying? Some say removing is the meaning of extracting, destroying is the meaning of breaking. Like taking weeds from among seedlings - extracting roots is likened to seeds, breaking stems is likened to present [afflictions]. Therefore the two meanings of removing and destroying differ. I think this is incorrect, because the two meanings are mutually applicable. Treatise

Commentary by Zenshu
Great Elements and Derived Matter Doctrine

Regarding "great elements and their derivatives... question and answer discrimination": Among these six approaches, if following difficulties in categorization, in the fourth approach, "causes and conditions" refers to causes meaning the ten causes such as attracting cause, and the six causes such as contributing cause. Conditions refer to the four conditions such as causal condition. In the fifth approach, "same and different" refers to same-type great [elements] and derivatives, as well as different-type great [elements] and derivatives. This constitutes same and different. This explains that in discussing categorical differences and identity-separation, there are both same and different [aspects]. Extensively [explained] as below.

"Distinguishing essence... no other separate things": In this first approach, [the text] generally describes three schools: first, non-Buddhist [schools], second, Abhidharma [schools], third, Mahāyāna school. Among the initial non-Buddhist [schools], [it] briefly indicates four schools. This is the initial description of the Materialist school. Within the Materialist school, [they] establish four doctrines: first, essence has only the four great elements; second, present exists while past and future do not; third, sentient beings have no transmigration; fourth, establishing the existence of realms etc. Generally establishing doctrines without [logical] meaning, mostly following worldly sentiments, conforming to various schools' intentions, hence called "Materialist." However, "nature is permanent with no other separate things" refers to the Materialist school's establishment: all dharmas of the eighteen realms and the self are all made of great elements as their essential nature. Besides the four great elements, there are no other separate things. The refined and subtle among harmonized four great elements, taking superior qualities, becomes their self. Next,

the refined and subtle [matter] becomes their mental dharmas. The coarse and impure [matter] becomes dharmas such as form. Wanting to resemble the doctrine of Vibhajyavādin ("Discriminating Theorists") within Buddhism, apart from the four great elements, there are no separate derived forms externally. Now indicating their intention, hence saying "no other separate things." Extensively describing that school is as explained in Master Wengui's Extensive Commentary on the Hundred [Treatises].

"Vaiśeṣika... both permanent and impermanent": This second [section] describes the Vaiśeṣika school. This master generally establishes six categories of meaning. Within the substance category alone, [they] establish nine types: earth, water, fire, wind, space, time, direction, self, and mind. Among those nine substances, four have no material obstruction: space, time, direction, and self. The remaining five are obstructive: the four great elements and mind. They explain that mind is atomic, like the size of two atomic fruits combined, yet also obstructive. Now these four great elements are precisely the first four types, hence called "four great elements." These are obstructive [dharmas] of the substance category. "Both permanent and impermanent" means: among the nine substances, five are permanent, four should be distinguished. Among earth, water, fire, and wind, those that are non-produced are permanent. Parental atoms are permanent because they are non-produced. If produced, [they are] impermanent. From child atoms onward, all are impermanent. Now these four great elements pervade both parental and child [atoms], hence saying "both permanent and impermanent."

"Eye faculty is fire... both permanent and impermanent": "Eye is fire etc." refers to the *Satyasiddhi Treatise*'s description of Vaiśeṣika doctrine: "Fire element is abundant in the eye. Why? Because [it] resembles karmic causation. As explained in sūtras, offering lamps gains [good] eyes. Therefore fire element is abundant in eyes." Up to: "Also, the eye definitely can see forms. Because forms belong to fire, [it] sees its own nature in return. Thus space, earth, water, wind etc. follow the faculties

[in being] predominantly [present]. That treatise's commentary says: "The eye's function resembles fire illuminating distant places. Using five great [elements] to form the eye faculty, fire element is abundant in the eye faculty. Five great [elements] form the ear faculty, space element is abundant in the ear faculty. Five great [elements] form the nose faculty, earth element is abundant in the nose faculty. Five great [elements] form the tongue faculty, water element is abundant in the tongue faculty. Five great [elements] form the body faculty, wind element is abundant in the body faculty." Hence saying "following faculties [in being] predominantly [present]." The present meaning is also the same, hence saying "eye is fire etc." "Sound and smell are only impermanent etc.": Among the twenty-four qualities, fourteen qualities - sensation, pleasure, pain, desire, anger, effort, merit, demerit, action, separation, that-ness, this-ness, sound, and smell - are impermanent. The remaining ten are either permanent or impermanent. Extensively as explained in *Vijñaptimātra* Commentary volume one.

However, "sound and smell are only impermanent": smell exists only in earth, hence only impermanent. The reason for this is: smell in earth element arises only when combined with fire. If fire's power is exhausted, smell does not arise. Hence only impermanent.

"Five types of form etc... not derivatives": "Five types of form etc. are qualities of four great elements": form, smell, taste, touch, and sound are called "five types of form etc." Question: Form, smell, taste, and touch being qualities of four great elements - that meaning is reasonable. The Vaiśeṣika school says "sound is a quality of space," not "a quality of four great elements." How can [one] add sound to call "five types of form etc. are qualities of four great elements"? This contradicts the text below [saying] "sound is a quality of space, not a quality of four great elements." The texts already contradict [each other] - how to reconcile? Explanation: Some say, if following the text below, [one] should say "four types of form etc. are qualities of four great elements." Sound is only a quality of space, hence should be excluded. Thus we know the character "five" is erroneous. However, [this is] still difficult to understand. Scholars should reflect. "Four great elements are not producers etc.": The four great elements are obstructive, form etc. are

【Lower Section】
non-obstructive. Therefore in mutual comparison, [they are] not producer and produced.

"Earth has form and smell... not qualities of four great elements": "Earth has form, smell, taste, touch etc.": If [something] has form, taste, smell, and touch, [it is] called earth. [One] manifests earth through qualities. If [something] has form, taste, and touch, [it is] called water. If [something] has form and touch, [it is] called fire. If [something] has touch, [it is] called wind. If [something] has only sound, [it is] called space. Space element exists separately - not unconditioned space, also not space-realm form. In the *Satyasiddhi* Commentary, describing disciples of Master Vaiśeṣika's doctrine: "Touch objects universally pervade all great [elements]. Other objects are localized. Earth contains five [qualities], only smell is primary, others are secondary. Using earth element to form the nose faculty, [it] can smell fragrances in return. Water contains four [qualities], only taste is primary, others are secondary. Using water element to form the tongue faculty, [it] can know tastes in return. Fire contains three [qualities], only form is primary, others are secondary. Using fire element to form the eye faculty, [it] can see forms in return. Wind contains sound and touch, only touch is primary. Using wind element to form the body faculty, [it] can know touch in return." However, this text says "wind has only touch," not saying it has sound. In that commentary, [it] says "wind has sound and touch." How do [they] contradict? Explanation: That [text] speaks about later doctrines, hence having sound and touch. This speaks about original doctrines, hence having only touch.

"Master Sāṅkhya... also has universal production": This third [section] describes the Sāṅkhya school. "Five types of form etc. called five subtle elements etc.": "Subtle elements" means "subtle" has the meaning of definite. Only definitely using these to form great [elements], faculties, etc., hence called "five subtle elements." "However, [there is] separate production and also universal production": [It is] transmitted that primordial nature produces mahat, mahat produces ego-attachment, ego-attachment produces five subtle [elements]. Thus in this sequence [they] mutually

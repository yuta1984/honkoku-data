Within the various forms created by one great element, when appropriately analyzed, there are many subtle particles, with eastern and western dwelling places each being different yet dwelling together in close mixture. This is called "the meaning of mixed non-separation." This meaning is similar to what the Sarvāstivāda and others explain: that subtle particles are each separate yet in the same aggregate with separate substances dwelling in two places. Hence saying "this is a conforming rational approach." Now in the Mahāyāna school, arousing form realm great elements, etc., within desire realm body are all the meaning of same-place non-separation. "Like different types of great [elements]" raises an analogy to explain this. For example, great elements within form and great elements within fragrance - when these two are compared, though their types differ, they are in the same place mutually interpenetrating. This is the meaning of same-place non-separation. The meaning that three realm four great elements dwell together in one place without separation should also be understood similarly. "These two forms, etc." - these two types of forms of upper and lower realms originally do not obstruct each other. Why would spacing be needed for separate dwelling? Therefore, explaining these two forms as mixed non-separation rather than same-place non-separation is a conforming approach, not Mahāyāna doctrine.

From "Question: great elements and created" to "non-material nature?" This is the third question. This question and answer are both Yogācārabhūmi fifty-four text. Hence that text says: "Question: By what cause do material dharmas dwell together in one place without mutual abandonment, yet are not called non-material nature?" [Above is treatise text]

Explanation: If following the treatise text, there should be two difficulties. Hence Master Jing explains the meaning of the difficulties: Generally, dharmas of material obstruction - if there is one, there is no second. How can other subtle particles mutually enter the place of one subtle particle of earth great element without the form increasing? This is the first difficulty. If in the place of one subtle particle

【Lower Section】
there are other subtle particles without mutual obstruction, this would be the same as non-obstructive dharmas like mind, etc. Why would it not be called non-obstructive nature? This is the second difficulty. [Above is master's text] Now in this chapter, briefly indicating the second difficulty without raising the first difficulty. Hence saying "why not explain as non-material nature?"

From "Answer: mutually compatible" to "this should also be thus." This is also treatise text. Hence that text says: "Because of compatible transformation. Through their mutual compatible arising in sequence, they do not mutually obstruct. Also arising as felt by such karmic augmentation of this type. Why? Because all form aggregates and all form faculties are jointly utilized," up to "Also there are various forms that in some places mutually obstruct each other, and in some places do not mutually obstruct, like intermediate existence forms, etc. Yet those forms are not non-material nature. The principle here should also be understood similarly." [Above is treatise text]

Explanation: The chapter master's Yogācāra commentary summarizes briefly: "Immediately through various fragrances, etc., being extremely mutually compatible without mutual obstruction." [Above commentary text] Master Jing says: "Because of compatible transformation. Through their sequential mutual compatible arising without mutual obstruction" addresses the first difficulty. That is, among various forms, when there are conflicting ones, each occupies a place with one present and one absent. If mutually compatible, then many exist in one. Hence saying "mutually compatible arising without mutual obstruction." "Also produced by this type of karmic augmentation" means immediately through karma, in one dust-place there are many subtle particles. "Because all faculties pervade there and jointly utilize" explains the reason. How can one know that in one dust-place there are many subtle particles? Explaining the cause: "Because all form aggregates and all form faculties jointly

utilize." That is, within all form aggregates, even taking the finest and smallest, they possess all sense-objects. Eyes see form, nose smells fragrance, tongue tastes flavor, body feels tangible. Hence knowing that all great element places possess all sense-objects. Therefore saying "because all faculties pervade there and jointly utilize." This completes addressing the first difficulty. "Like intermediate existence, etc., though having material nature" addresses the second difficulty. Hence that text says "Also there are various forms that in some places mutually obstruct each other" means like two earth great element subtle particles, two forms, two fragrances, two tangibles - though being sense-objects of the same nature, they necessarily do not mutually enter and mutually obstruct each other. "Or in some places do not mutually obstruct" means like earth and four sense-objects, each having only one, then they do not mutually obstruct. Like intermediate existence form, when seeking a place of birth, passing directly through stone mountains without obstruction. If intermediate existence encounters [obstacles] or enters the mother's womb, it cannot pass through. This then has obstruction. Various forms are also thus. Those forms are not non-material nature. This also explains treatise text according to Master Jing's intention. If explaining text according to the chapter master, only regarding dharmas and analogies, partially explaining the meaning of non-obstruction. Should be understood as in the text.

From "Question: great elements and created" to "dwelling in confusion?" This is the fourth question. In this question and answer, the question is immediately Mahāvibhāṣā fascicle 127 text, and the answer is immediately Yogācārabhūmi sixty-six text. Hence the Vibhāṣā says: "Question: How do great elements and created forms dwell? Do great elements exist below with created forms above? Do great elements exist above with created forms below? Do great elements and created forms dwell mixed together with great elements outside and created forms within? If so, what fault is there? All have faults. If

【Lower Section】
great elements are below and created forms above, then among the various created forms, those close to great elements can have great elements as producing causes, but among created forms there are those separated and distant - how can great elements be their cause? If great elements are above and created forms below, then created forms should be causes of great elements, and great elements should not be causes of created forms. If great elements and created forms dwell mixed together with great elements outside and created forms within, then when cutting, one should see various gaps like cutting lotus root." That treatise's answer says: "One explanation: being below as cause, because dependent dharmas should be thus. Question: If so, regarding closely pressed forms one can speak of able-to-create, but regarding separated distant ones, how do they create? Answer: Not saying that all great elements possessed by one tree are entirely below creating all created forms, but saying that each part of one tree has great elements below and created forms above. There is another explanation: dwelling mixed together with great elements outside and created forms within." "Question: If so, when cutting shouldn't one see various gaps like cutting lotus root? Answer: Though there are gaps, they cannot be seen because all great elements are not visible. The visible gaps are created forms." [Above is treatise text]

Explanation: Now in this chapter, only borrowing that question without using the answer's meaning. Therefore in the answer, only quoting Mahāyāna text.

From "Sixty-five explains" to "maṇi and other aggregates." This quotes Mahāyāna text to answer the previous question. This is immediately Yogācārabhūmi treatise fascicle sixty-six text. Examining various chapter texts, all say "sixty-five explains." Also examining the chapter master's Abhidharma commentary fascicle one also says "sixty-five explains." However, examining sixty-five,

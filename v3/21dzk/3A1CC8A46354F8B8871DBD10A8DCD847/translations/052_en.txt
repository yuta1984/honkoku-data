[The text] explains: When various sages use mundane wisdom subsequently attained after supramundane wisdom to separate from desires, one should know this is the same as separation from desires performed by those who are not on the noble path - it can only damage and suppress affliction seeds, not permanent elimination. This mundane wisdom is subsequently attained after supramundane wisdom. One should say this wisdom is both mundane and supramundane, not call it exclusively mundane. Since [it] says [this is] the same as non-noble separation from desires, [it] is not that [they] do not use those six practices for separation from desires. However, these six practices are post-attainment from supramundane [wisdom] and should not be called exclusively mundane. [This has] the same meaning as the previously quoted base ground text saying learned noble ones cultivate separation from desire paths and contemplate coarseness, tranquility, etc. However, quoting fascicle sixty-nine saying noble ones do not use six practices - [we] do not know what text [this] quotes.

"Thirty-six practices, up to 'not attained by ordinary beings'": Also only suppression, not elimination, etc. Within subsequent seeing path, objectifying established truths, [one] arises these sixteen [practices]. Within true seeing path, only objectifying non-established [truths], therefore not arising sixteen [practices]. Within preparatory path, though cultivating sixteen [practices], these are expedient means, not proper true contemplation. From this [we] clearly know these sixteen practices only suppress, not eliminate. *Compilation* says: Since [we] already allow three liberation gates all apply to sixteen practices, these sixteen practices do not only objectify established [truths]. Within one moment of proper contemplation, using meaning [they] divide into sixteen. *Abhidharma Treatise* says: Purifying afflictions' objects means lower ground's coarse nature and upper ground's tranquil nature - explained according to mundane paths. Through this [one] controls and suppresses various entanglements. True suchness and four truths - explained according to supramundane paths. Briefly, true suchness; extensively, four truths. Through this [one] permanently destroys latent tendencies.

Therefore, since [one] objectifies four truths and permanently destroys latent tendencies, [we] know sixteen [practices] can also properly eliminate. This precisely refutes the chapter author's text of "only suppression, not elimination." Now defending this, saying "only suppression, not elimination" is explained according to preparatory stages suppressing view-afflictions. The sixteen arising within subsequent seeing path still do not suppress view-afflictions, much less eliminate view-afflictions. *Treatise* fascicle ten says: Those obstacles manifest and are already suppressed before grounds. Also fascicle nine says: Discriminative latent tendencies are already truly eliminated. Therefore, if [they are] afflictions confused about phenomena, using sixteen practices can also eliminate them. Therefore *Treatise* fascicle ten says: Subsequently-attained non-discriminative wisdom can also permanently eliminate latent tendencies confused about phenomena. *Abhidharma Treatise's* meaning explains elimination according to this. The chapter author's meaning is according to suppressing view-afflictions, therefore [there is] no contradiction.

Question: If long-cultivating bodhisattvas do not use six practices, why do [they] not suppress lower ground afflictions yet attain birth in form realm?

Answer: Though not using six practices, using non-defiled wisdom's power to suppress lower ground afflictions and be born in upper form realm. However, [they] are not born in formless [realm] because [there is] no benefit.

"However *Buddha Nature Treatise*, up to 'no need for reconciliation'": This is text from *Buddha Nature Treatise* fascicle four, Unchanging Character chapter. Therefore that chapter says: Those with equal contemplation have sharp and dull [faculties]. If sharp-facultied people, within one moment, equally contemplate four truths, eliminating eighty-eight afflictions simultaneously - all called seeing truths. If dull-facultied people in sequential contemplation, immediately first moment contemplates suffering, not seeing other three truths, only eliminating [afflictions] under suffering - called seeing truths. Remaining uneliminated [afflictions] all belong to contemplation. This is called "seeing truths grasping elimination."

Answer: Contemplation means cultivation-afflictions. Eighty-eight bonds means view-afflictions. However, fundamental afflictions differ between Mahāyāna and

Hīnayāna schools. If following Mahāyāna, view-afflictions [are] one hundred twelve, cultivation-afflictions sixteen, totaling one hundred twenty-eight. Under desire realm's four truths, each has ten afflictions. Upper realms' four truths, excluding hatred, each [has] nine. Combined with previous, totaling one hundred twelve. Desire realm's cultivation-afflictions have six: greed, hatred, pride, ignorance, self-view, extreme views. Upper two realms' cultivation-afflictions each [have] five, excluding hatred, totaling one hundred twenty-eight. As explained in *Prakaraṇāryavāca* fascicle one. If following Hīnayāna schools, view-afflictions [are] eighty-eight, cultivation-afflictions only ten, totaling ninety-eight fetters. Eighty-eight view-afflictions: within desire realm's four truths, under suffering [are] ten fetters: first, self-view; second, extreme views; third, wrong views; fourth, view-grasping; fifth, precept-grasping; sixth, greed; seventh, hatred; eighth, pride; ninth, doubt; tenth, ignorance. Under origination, seven fetters: first, wrong views; second, view-grasping; third, greed; fourth, hatred; fifth, pride; sixth, doubt; seventh, ignorance. Under cessation, also seven, same as seven under origination. Under path, eight fetters - seven same as origination and cessation, additionally adding precept-grasping, therefore eight fetters, totaling thirty-two. Within form realm's four truths, under suffering, nine fetters - excluding hatred from ten. Others as explained above. Under origination, six fetters: first, wrong views; second, view-grasping; third, greed; fourth, pride; fifth, doubt; sixth, ignorance. Under cessation, also six, same as six under origination. Under path, seven fetters - adding [something] like precept-grasping among previous six, totaling twenty-eight. Formless [realm's] four truths also have twenty-eight. Taking numbers, same as form [realm]. Under desire realm's cultivation path [are] four fetters: first, greed; second, hatred; third, pride; fourth, ignorance. Form and formless cultivation paths each [have] three: greed, pride, ignorance. Three realms' view and cultivation combined total ninety-eight fetters. Now saying "eighty-eight bonds" only mentions view-afflictions. Temporarily dividing upper and lower, etc. [is] chapter author's text. Not needing reconciliation: *Compilation* says: Since [it is] not original text, no need for reconciliation explanation. This interpretation is rather difficult. How [to] decide whether Sanskrit original exists or not? Now chapter author's meaning: Paramārtha Tripiṭaka述小乘義, no need for reconciliation. Not saying there is no Sanskrit original.

"That Vātsīputrīya school, up to 'no need for discrimination'": First suffering-dharma patience contemplates desire realm suffering, etc. Examining *School Wheel Commentary*, text differs somewhat. There [it says] first suffering-dharma wisdom immediately contemplates desire realm suffering. Here [it] says suffering-dharma patience contemplates desire realm suffering. Also there [it says] second suffering-dharma patience later contemplates whether desire realm suffering truth's afflictions are eliminated or not eliminated, etc. Here [it] says second suffering-dharma seeing repeatedly contemplates desire suffering's complete exhaustion or incomplete exhaustion. Third suffering-category wisdom - both there and here are same. Thus [they] contradict each other, [but we] have not detailed the reason. Patience, wisdom, and seeing are all different names for discernment. Do [they] substitute through this?

"Seventh depending on grades, up to 'elimination also nine grades'": Below explains grade numbers. [There are] three teachers' meanings, all ancient explanations. First teacher's intention: no separate grade numbers. Using truth to contemplate falsity, [there is] no falsity to remove. Even elimination is hard to attain, much less grades. Next teacher's intention: grade numbers are limitless. Within three great eons, moment by moment arising wisdom, instant by instant, able to destroy various afflictions. *Satyasiddhi* also says: neither eight nor nine; using limitless mind to eliminate various afflictions, etc. These above two teachers have not detailed that noble paths [have] nine grades, afflictions also nine grades - using lowest-lowest path to treat highest-highest bonds. *Old Compendium Treatise* says: When audition-perfuming arises in lower grade, [it] can counteract upper grade fundamental consciousness. Up to: when audition-perfuming arises in upper grade, [it] can counteract lower grade fundamental consciousness. Therefore [we] know both what counteracts and what is counteracted have nine grades. Extensively as in that chapter.

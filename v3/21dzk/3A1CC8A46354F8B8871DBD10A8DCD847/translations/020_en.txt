levels, clarifying differences. Question: The second conventional also includes the unconditioned, so why only speak of "mind-transformed phenomena"? Explanation: The unconditioned portion of dharma-base and dharma-realm that are objects of mental consciousness are mind-transformed, thus included in other-dependent nature. Therefore called "phenomena." Though transformed by consciousness, being similar before and after without alteration, they are provisionally called "unconditioned," as explained in treatise volume two. "Mind-transformed principles" of the latter two conventionals: Four Noble Truths and two emptinesses are established depending on teachings, being transformations within subsequent-attainment wisdom consciousness, hence called "mind-transformed principles."

Tradition says "the latter two conventionals are mind-transformed principles." Question: That established conventional is mind-transformed principle - this meaning is acceptable. But is non-established conventional also aspectual? Explanation: It doesn't mean aspectual portions become fourth conventional. Through designations of two emptinesses, aspectual portions generally become fourth non-established conventional. Now I think not so. Fourth conventional has two meanings: First, manifesting meaning through designations - this is establishment gate. Second, reaching meaning apart from designations - this is non-establishment. Now taking establishment as fourth conventional. Non-establishment meaning becomes ultimate fourth. How do we know only establishment meaning is fourth conventional? Yogācāra sixty-four and Manifestation six both say "four kinds of conventional are all established." Extensively as explained there.

Regarding the text "Its fourth ultimate... called discrimination-substance gate": Fourth ultimate is only realized by correct wisdom, not the realm of subsequent-attainment wisdom, hence called "non-mind-transformed principle." "According to their respective applications, they are the three natures" - the three natures have two aspects. First, permanent-impermanent gate: permanent is perfected nature, only true-suchness being this. All conditioned are other-dependent arising. Second, contaminated-uncontaminated gate: all uncontaminated are perfected reality; all contaminated dharmas are

other-dependent arising. Following first gate, among four conventional levels, first conventional is included in imagined nature, latter three conventionals are all included in other-dependent. The reason: second conventional truth is mind-transformed phenomena; latter two conventionals are mind-transformed principles. Though phenomena and principles differ, being all mind-transformed they are all other-dependent. Among four ultimate levels, first three ultimates are other-dependent nature; previous three ultimates are same as conventional's latter three ultimates, all other-dependent. Fourth ultimate is only perfected reality. Following latter gate, second conventional truth encompasses contaminated and uncontaminated, thus encompassing two natures - other-dependent nature and perfected reality nature. Latter two conventionals, being only uncontaminated, are perfected nature. Four ultimate levels should be understood accordingly. Due to such differences, it says "according to their respective applications, they are the three natures." Tradition says "according to their respective applications, they are the three natures" only discusses fourth ultimate, not extending to other levels. In fourth ultimate, grasped ultimate is imagined, mind-transformed is other-dependent, original ultimate is perfected. Now I think not so. "According to their respective applications, they are the three natures" generally refers to four levels of two truths, as previously explained. Abandoning designations and discussing essence is not grasped mind-objects. How could this further divide three natures? Therefore previous text says "abandoning designations discussing essence is not objects." Therefore that text explains it's not grasped mind-objects. How could it encompass imagined nature?

Regarding the text "Second, three vehicles... allow observing ultimate and conventional": Master Yuan says: "Sarvāstivāda school takes phenomena as conventional, principles as ultimate truth. Aggregates, realms, sense-bases etc. having mutual separation - these are phenomena. Suffering, impermanence etc. - the sixteen aspects of noble truths as universal characteristics - these are principles. Also, Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā treatise clarifies ultimate and conventional through Four Noble Truths. Four truths' sixteen principles like suffering etc. are ultimate meaning. Suffering like abscesses, up to path like

rafts - these are conventional truth. Abhidharmahṛdaya treatise also explains two truths, extensively as explained there. If following their explanation, two vehicles also seem to perform two-truth observation. Now it's not so. "Two vehicles' own explanation etc." discusses the scope of Lesser Vehicle teachings. Various Lesser Vehicle people, depending on their respective teachings, all think thus: observing Four Noble Truths brings severance of delusions and attainment of fruits, yet still don't know that only observing Four Noble Truths' suchness severs delusions and attains fruits. Only Great Vehicle practitioners truly know this principle. Therefore now explaining: even regarding Lesser Vehicle, they also realize person-emptiness; during preparatory observation, they also observe ultimate and conventional. Namely, Four Noble Truths' suchness as ultimate, Four Noble Truths as conventional. These principles are not what Lesser Vehicle knows. Now Great Vehicle itself explains and teaches this principle, therefore saying "two vehicles' own explanation etc."

Regarding the text "Nirvāṇa Sūtra says... middle wisdom, superior wisdom": This is Nirvāṇa Sūtra chapter thirteen text. "This namely conventional truth below" is the chapter master's text. Two truths each have middle and superior wisdom. This manifests conventional truth's middle and superior wisdom. Knowing through general characteristics is middle wisdom; knowing through discrimination is superior wisdom. Regarding what middle wisdom knows, Buddha already explained it in that sūtra. Regarding what superior wisdom knows, Buddha has not yet explained it in that sūtra. This is meaning already explained in previous sūtras.

Regarding the text "All formations non-existent... as extensively explained below": This is also sūtra text. "This ultimate meaning below" is chapter master's text. "Impermanence, selflessness, nirvāṇa, tranquility are ultimate meaning" - this is previous sūtra's ultimate meaning, through middle wisdom, thus meaning already explained in previous sūtras. "Knowing ultimate meaning as immeasurable, boundless etc." - this is later sūtra's ultimate meaning, through superior wisdom, thus meaning not yet explained in previous sūtras.

"Discriminating wisdom as superior etc." means knowing through discrimination is called "discriminating wisdom"; knowing through general characteristics is called "general wisdom." Knowing through discrimination is called "superior"; knowing through general characteristics is called "middle." This general and discriminating wisdom both depend on subsequent wisdom, not taking correct wisdom. Abhidharmasamuccaya treatise eleven says "discriminating wisdom" means "post-attainment wisdom after transcending world." These two wisdoms are as extensively explained below.

Regarding the text "Same as Benevolent Kings Sūtra... wisdom should not be two": In Benevolent Kings Sūtra volume one, Two Truths chapter, King Prasenajit says: "In ultimate meaning, is there conventional truth or not? If saying none, wisdom should not be two. If saying there is, wisdom should not be one." The text quoted here seems slightly different, but the meaning has no contradiction. "If there is, truth should not be one" means truly knowing and understanding oneness, realizing non-dual principle. Since able-to-realize wisdom is already one, realized truth is also one. If within conventional truth there is ultimate truth, since truth has two, wisdom should also be two, therefore saying "truth should not be one." "If none, wisdom should not be two" means knowing conventional is called "conventional wisdom"; knowing ultimate is called "ultimate wisdom." If within conventional truth there is no ultimate truth, since truth is then one, wisdom should also be one, therefore saying "wisdom should not be two." Explaining this difficulty is extensively as explained there.

Regarding the text "Namely manifesting person-dharmas... all have two truths": "Namely manifesting person-dharmas all have two truths" - since truth is already two, wisdom also has two. Able-to-know wisdom becomes "person two truths"; known truth becomes "dharma two truths." Therefore person-dharmas all have two truths. "Taking person-comparison, ordinary beings as lower etc." clarifies wisdom differences. This compares ordinary and noble beings to clarify distinctions. Question: If two vehicles are middle and Tathāgata is superior, why does Nirvāṇa Sūtra say "through lower wisdom observation, attain śrāvaka bodhi; through middle wisdom observation, attain

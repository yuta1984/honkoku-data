draws forth and generates. Therefore it says "because it is drawn forth and generated by the power of previous defiled-pure states."

Regarding the text "The middle three minds... the number is indefinite." "The middle three minds are mostly explained regarding mental consciousness" etc. means that within one mental consciousness there is already no simultaneous arising, so the number is not distinguished. If one permits the five consciousnesses to arise during the stages of seeking and determining, the number follows what was said before. If one is at the fruition stage, following whatever minds are possessed, they are complete in one moment, so all can arise together. The remaining text can be understood.

Regarding the text "Eighth, various stages... there is definitely sudden arising." "This explains the five minds etc." means that having complete five minds at the causal stage necessarily depends on encountering new objects. If encountering familiar objects, there are only the three minds from determining onward. "Because it does not continue for one moment" means that from seeking onward, they mostly achieve continuation. If other conditions seize them, they may also last one moment, hence "because it does not continue for one moment." "There is no case of only seeking without arising sudden" refers to encountering new objects. If encountering new objects and arising seeking, sudden must first arise, then seeking follows. If encountering familiar objects, there may be only seeking without arising sudden. The previous text says "After seeing image-form, then observing various forms. Because already seen before, sudden does not arise. Or seeking arises instead, drawing forth determination." Therefore it is known that regarding previous familiar objects, there are cases of arising only seeking without arising sudden.

Regarding the text "Among the five consciousnesses... therefore there are only four." "Because Yogācāra explains" - Yogācāra volume three says "Again, after the five consciousnesses arise in one moment, immediately afterward mental consciousness necessarily arises." When it says "mental consciousness," this is seeking. "Not the remaining consciousnesses" distinguishes the stage of mastery. Regarding the uniform flow of the five and six consciousnesses, if in the stage of mastery, although sudden arises, determination naturally occurs without relying on seeking. Therefore this is distinguished. Master Wŏnhyo

says that even when not yet at the stage of mastery, there are also cases of only sudden without seeking mind. Why? If sudden mind conditions familiar objects, immediately after this mind, determining mind arises. As Yogācāra says "The mental consciousness arising immediately after the five consciousnesses is either seeking or determining." Therefore it is known that seeking mind does not necessarily arise. As explained in the Golden Drum Commentary.

Regarding the text "Discussing the three vehicles in general... as already explained before." "The undefiled has all five" etc. means that undefiled mind at the causal stage has aspiration, therefore it has seeking. "Namely the meaning of various moments" etc. means that within the undefiled stage, it is entirely good and has no meaning of three-nature transformation, so the five minds are not explained. Only the various moments are explained as existing separately according to meaning, not arising in sequence.

Regarding the text "Ninth, three natures... encompassed by the three natures." "The first three minds are neutral" etc. means this depends on naturally arising in sequence according to objects. Because of this principle, Vijñaptimātratā also says "For those not yet transformed, sudden-arising mind is definitely neutral." If objects are strong and superior, and the five minds of various consciousnesses arise mixed, they all penetrate and are encompassed by the three natures. Like when hearing sound in concentration, the sudden arising of mental consciousness concurrent with ear-consciousness is good, etc. Question: That the first three are neutral - among the four neutrals, which neutral encompasses them? Master Zhuang says: Among the four neutrals, only matured karma and deportment, not skill and supernatural result. Skill and transformation condition unfamiliar objects. Also, those two minds can arise only up to uniform-flow mind.

Regarding the text "If in the undefiled stage... all are mostly good." Saying "mostly" means "all." It does not mean distinguishing few to

name it "many." Therefore the Commentary says "all are entirely good."

Regarding the text "Tenth, conditioned arising... its meaning is definite." Multiple consciousnesses draw forth and generate one consciousness, one consciousness draws forth and generates multiple consciousnesses, mutually serving as conditions for immediate arising. Therefore it says "serving as conditions for immediate arising." It does not take the equal-immediate condition because they are not equal. Now when it says "immediate," if discussing in terms of moments, it is the immediacy of subsequent arising. If discussing new mutual generation, this is simultaneity of immediacy. Since consciousnesses are like this, the various minds are also thus. Therefore it says "multiple sudden arisings draw forth the arising of one consciousness's seeking mind," etc.

Regarding the text "Permitting one consciousness one... because they arise in one moment." "Multiple consciousnesses drawing minds arise in one moment" - some texts say "multiple consciousnesses, multiple minds." However, the Commentary changes this text saying "Also permit one consciousness one mind to arise in one moment with multiple consciousnesses' separate minds." Therefore, following the Commentary's intention now, "得" is the character "与," "引" is the character "別." Perhaps this is where later people mistakenly copied "得引."

Regarding the text "According to this principle... wise ones should reflect." "Various consciousnesses can have complete five minds in one moment" etc. means that in one moment, eye-consciousness sudden, ear-consciousness seeking, nose-consciousness determining, tongue-consciousness defiled-pure, body-consciousness uniform flow arise simultaneously. The eye-object is newly encountered, the rest are all familiar objects. At that time, what mind should the mental consciousness be called? It is named according to what predominates, or all can be named. Namely, conditioning eye-objects is called "sudden-arising," up to conditioning touch being called "uniform-flow mind." Like having complete four in one moment at the fruition stage, this is also thus. The reason is that objects have new and familiar, and what they draw forth differs.

Regarding the text "Eleventh, what... not worldly objects." "The four minds in fruition condition objects of the three times" - in the Buddha

【Lower Section】
Ground Treatise and Vijñaptimātratā, there are two masters' interpretations. The first master says "Accomplishing wisdom only conditions the five kinds of present objects," etc. The second master says "It can also universally condition all dharmas of the three times." This first interpretation here corresponds to that second one. It only conditions the conditioned dharmas of the three times, not conditioning unconditioned dharmas. This is the correct interpretation of Dharmapāla that accomplishing wisdom has no essential-nature wisdom. "Also conditioning non-worldly objects" - in the Vijñaptimātratā chapter, describing two interpretations it says "Accomplishing wisdom is only conventional activity conditioning the shallow." Or it also penetrates the true because of autonomous fulfillment. The first is Dharmapāla's interpretation, the latter is other masters' interpretation. This "according to one interpretation" corresponds to that second one. Unconditioned dharmas do not fall into the three times, therefore called "non-worldly." Since autonomously fulfilled, why would it not condition the true? Therefore it says "conditions non-worldly objects."

Regarding the text "Seventh, causal stage... and non-worldly objects." "Substantial objects" briefly indicates one type. If speaking completely, substantial and reflected are only present objects. "Aspects" refers to the aspects of grasped self. "Non-worldly objects" has two types. The grasped real self of the untransformed stage is called "non-worldly objects." The principle of no-self of the transformed stage is also called "non-worldly objects." Now saying "fruition stage" reveals the stages from transformation onward.

Regarding the text "Eighth, cause and effect... and non-worldly objects." "At fruition penetrating and conditioning worldly and non-worldly objects" - Question: The mind-king in perfect mirror wisdom penetrates and conditions true and conventional real objects - this principle is undoubtable. It is not yet known whether the five mental factors also condition real objects? Answer: The objects of true wisdom have no distinction of conventional and real. Therefore king and retinue both attain real objects. The objects of conventional wisdom have distinctions of conventional and real. Therefore the king attains the real, while mind-

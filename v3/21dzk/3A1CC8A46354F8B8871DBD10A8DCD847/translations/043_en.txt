Therefore, [they are] not of karmic nature. "Fruits exist in the remaining seven consciousnesses, etc." means: If [they are] fruits obtained from afflictive obstacles, they are coarse fruits of segmented [birth and death]. If [they are] fruits obtained from cognitive obstacles, they are subtle fruits of transformation. These two fruits exist in the remaining seven consciousnesses, excluding the seventh consciousness. The reason for this is that the seventh consciousness is not produced by being led by the karmic power of the other six consciousnesses. When it says "fruits exist in the remaining seven consciousnesses," it only explains retribution fruits, dominant fruits, and instrumental fruits that are produced by the karmic force of good and unwholesome retributive causes, etc. It does not explain equal-flow fruits. Because the seventh also has equal-flow fruits. The mutual influence of past and future, producing subsequent similar types, all applies to the eight consciousnesses. The seventh consciousness also has equal-flow fruits. Question: That there are no retribution fruits in the seventh consciousness - this doctrine is reasonable because [it is] not a karmic fruit. Instrumental and dominant [fruits] are not necessarily karmic fruits. How is it that the seventh lacks these fruits? Explanation: When the ālaya-vijñāna arises, it takes karma and karmic seeds as the basis for instrumental and dominant [causes]. Because it takes proximate and distant conditions as functional bases. The fruits sensed by retributive causes are also called instrumental fruits and also called dominant fruits. Because we now rely on this explanation, the seventh consciousness lacks instrumental [fruits], etc. The doctrine of the five fruits is as explained in treatise fascicle eight and Master Ci'en's commentary fascicle eight.

"From 'Second, what can eliminate' to 'because there is freedom from contamination'": "Times of freedom from desire and regression, etc." refers to text from the *Saṃyuktāhṛdaya* treatise fascicle nine, Miscellaneous Chapter. Therefore that verse says: "Times of freedom from desire and regression, rebirth, death, cutting off good, and continuation - know that this is mental consciousness." Explanation: Mental consciousness has six matters not shared with the five consciousnesses, namely freedom from desire, etc. According to the present sectarian intention, both ordinary beings and sages eliminating delusions all use

wisdom co-arising with mental consciousness to eliminate all fetters and bonds. This applies to both mundane and supramundane wisdom, not using the five consciousnesses. Because those five consciousnesses are good consciousnesses that are only momentary and therefore do not continue. Therefore the *Abhidharmakośa-bhāṣya* also agrees with this explanation. Four schools - Mahāsāṅghika, Ekavyāvahārika, Lokottaravāda, and Kaukkuṭika - all explain that the five consciousnesses also have freedom from contamination. However, within those schools there are two explanations. First: The five consciousnesses serve as preparation and lead to the arising of the noble path, like when seeing the Buddha the noble path immediately arises. Therefore they are called "freedom from contamination" - not that they can eliminate contamination. Second: Since they already permit the essence of the five consciousnesses to apply to the uncontaminated, explaining that they can be free from contamination is without doubt in principle. In the present text, it provisionally raises the latter explanation.

"From 'The Vātsiputrīya school explains' to 'wisdom correctly eliminates'": According to the Vātsiputrīya school's intention, the five consciousnesses are neutral and lack discrimination, therefore they do not eliminate delusions. "Satyasiddhi masters, etc." refers to the late Sautrāntika master Harivarman, called "Lion's Armor." Regarding his origins and intellectual virtues, see the explanation in Kaishan's Doctrinal Preface. Changlin Fengsan, etc. call him a disciple of Kumāralāta. Master Dagao calls him a disciple of Dharmaguptaka, as explained in Master Zong's chapter. The Satyasiddhi master establishes two kinds of four minds: First, bodily consciousness's four minds - because there is contact with discrimination. Second, mental consciousness's four minds - because they discriminate through consciousness. These four minds are as explained in fascicle eight's Guide to Doctrine chapter. What is now called "behavioral mind wisdom" is the fourth mind among the mental consciousness's four. Speaking of "four minds": first, consciousness; second, sensation; third, perception; fourth, mental formations. Among these, the first three are neutral. The fourth, behavioral mind, applies to the three natures. This master's intention shows that ordinary beings' mundane [wisdom]

cannot eliminate delusions. Only sages' noble wisdom can eliminate afflictions. What can eliminate is wisdom, not co-arisen with the six consciousnesses, because that treatise school's consciousnesses are neutral. It only depends on the wisdom of the fourth, final behavioral mind to correctly eliminate. Extensive explanation of the four minds is as in the various doctrinal commentaries of that school.

"From 'Mahāyāna exists only' to 'therefore explained as non-'": "Regression and freedom from desire, etc." - regarding the mental consciousness's exclusive activities, Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna differ. According to Hīnayāna, there are only six exclusive matters not shared with the five consciousnesses: first, freedom from desire; second, regression; third, cutting off good; fourth, continuing good; fifth, death; sixth, rebirth. In present Mahāyāna, it clarifies fifteen kinds of exclusive activities, beginning with "discriminating objects" and ending with "rebirth." What is now called "freedom from desire" is the tenth activity. Through five causes and conditions, one achieves freedom from desire. First, because roots concordant with freedom from desire mature - meaning both ordinary beings and sages must await [the time when] desire-faculties mature before being able to be free from desire. Up to the fifth, proper cultivation of skillful means without inverted thinking - meaning ordinary beings suppress delusions, therefore having the doctrine of regression; sages eliminate seeds and never regress in any direction. Speaking of regression refers to the eleventh, regression from freedom from desire. Also through five conditions one experiences regression from freedom from desire. First, because of soft faculties by nature. Up to fifth, because of being influenced by evil friends. Extensively as explained in *Yogācāra* fascicle one. "Equality wisdom arises through being led by others, etc." - the arising of equality wisdom necessarily occurs through being led by mental [consciousness], becoming perfect mirror wisdom. It arises only at the fruit stage. Therefore among the remaining consciousnesses there is no doctrine of eliminating obstacles. Question: If the seventh also lacks the ability to eliminate, why does the *Compendium Treatise* say: "Where there is an antidote, there is what is treated. It is not that there is no such antidote in the five consciousnesses. In this path of seeing,

it does not arise." The seventh should be like the five consciousnesses, lacking that exclusive ignorance, because it permits no antidote. Explanation: Though the seventh lacks correct treatment, it can arise in the path of seeing. Since it can temporarily suppress [afflictions], calling it an antidote is not mistaken. Because there is this antidote, the reasoning does not succeed. Extensively as explained there.

"From 'If eliminative nature' to 'not dependent consciousness'": According to the ninth consciousness, there are two kinds: first, true consciousness; second, pure consciousness. The first is unconditioned, the latter is conditioned. Now taking true consciousness as eliminative nature, therefore it says "not dependent consciousness."

"From 'Fourth, depending on paths' to 'contaminated and uncontaminated'": "Namely preparatory path, uninterrupted path, etc." - among the five paths of accumulation, etc., only the cultivation path stage completely gives rise to the four paths. In the path of seeing, various explanations differ. Fan says: According to *Yogācāra* treatise fascicle 69, explaining that the path of seeing is a swift-progress path. Therefore we know the path of seeing does not complete the four paths. Also, tradition says there is only no skillful means but the remaining three paths exist. Also, there are only the two paths of uninterrupted and liberation. "Preparatory" means applying effort and practice, etc. Seeking the path of elimination with joy, gradually eliminating what is treated is called the preparatory path. Also called the skillful means path, because through skillful means one advances toward the elimination path. This name "preparatory" is not necessarily strenuous effort. Though the eighth ground and above are effortless, they still have advancing preparatory paths. "Uninterrupted path" means without the interval of afflictive categories. When the categories eliminated by this path are exhausted, it is called the uninterrupted path. Also called the unobstructed path, because no afflictive categories obstruct this path. Also, "uninterrupted" means without cessation. If this path arises, there is no further

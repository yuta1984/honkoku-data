regarding these characteristics. Now pointing to that, hence saying "extensively as explained in fascicle three of that treatise." If regarding realm inclusion, immediately in this text, fearing it refers to the inclusion of the three realms of desire, etc., now quoting text to extensively clarify its meaning. This text is deeply hidden, so effort should be applied.

From "sixty-three explains" to "hence briefly should stop." This explains the characteristics of existence and non-existence of great elements and created [forms] regarding the three realms. Some chapter texts say "sixty-three explains," and some texts say "sixty-two explains." The *Compendium* also says "sixty-two explains." These are all errors. Examining "sixty-three and sixty-two," this text is completely absent. Only sixty-six contains this text. Therefore, the chapter master's *Abhidharma Commentary* fascicle one also quotes sixty-six. *Yogācārabhūmi* sixty-six says: "Moreover, in completely solid form aggregates, only the functional activity of earth-realm exists. If in the desire realm, there are also the activities of form, fragrance, taste realms. In the form realm, only the functional activity of form-realm exists. The remaining water, fire, wind, and sound realms are only followed by seeds, and only after obtaining different conditions can they perform activities." [Above is treatise text]

Explanation: That the desire realm has earth and also form, fragrance, taste, and the form realm has only form means that in desire and form realms, though there is also tangible, the created tangible has no separate substance apart from the great elements. Hence it is not discussed separately. Therefore in the desire realm, only form, fragrance, taste are indicated, and in the form realm only form is mentioned without discussing tangible objects. "The remaining water, fire, wind and sound realms only have seeds and can perform activities only after awaiting different conditions" means, for example, if obtaining fire conditions, iron flows to become water, or meeting conditions for heating immediately adds to fire, etc. "Form realm bound excludes fragrance and taste" - this is the chapter master's additional explanation text, not treatise text.

"Form in the formless realm, according to correspondence, is said to exist and can be obtained" means that in the formless realm, there is no karmic result form, only meditative result form. This refers to manifest [phenomena]. If speaking of realm, karmic result great elements and created [forms] all exist according to correspondence. Hence saying "according to correspondence said to exist and can be obtained."

From "Question: in the desire realm" to "not dwelling in different places." This is the second question. This question and answer are both *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-four text. However, among the two in the answer, first indicating fifty-four text, later from "through the base consciousness within" below is the chapter master's additional explanation. This is the first text. *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-four says: "Furthermore, those in the desire realm, depending on desire realm body, arouse form realm great elements to manifest. How do those great elements dwell together with lower realm form? Are they in different places or not in different places? It should be said: like water situated in sand, not dwelling in different places." [Above is treatise text]

Explanation: Master Jing says: Desire realm form is coarse, form realm great elements supplement within the body. Like water entering sand, the location does not differ. Because there are differences in nature and type, it is not same-place non-separation. That is the meaning of mixed non-separation. However, mixed non-separation mostly applies to same-stage beginning and end, same-aggregate karmic result and nutritional forms. This is upper realm bound form dwelling in desire realm body, hence it is not that mixed non-separation meaning. [Above is master's text]

Master Fan says: *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-four, regarding three realm four great elements dwelling together, etc., using water and sand as analogy, immediately corresponds to the *Abhidharma's* aggregate collection correspondence, their meanings being similar. [Above is master's text]

Also *Mahāvibhāṣā* 134 says: "Question: If born in desire realm when form realm great elements manifest, where do they manifest? Some say between eyebrows, some say nose tip, some say near heart.

Some say near navel, some say toes. Other masters say: Desire realm great elements are coarse, form realm great elements are fine. Fine enters coarse gaps, like oil entering sand." [Above is treatise text] The present Mahāyāna doctrine corresponds to the sixth explanation. Desire realm form is coarse, form realm great elements supplement within the body, hence saying "fine enters coarse gaps, etc."

From "through the base consciousness within" to "hence not different dwelling." From here below is the chapter master's text, not treatise text. "Within the base consciousness there are two types, etc." - "type" means category, not the meaning of seed. Saying "pure production, mixed production" - the *Essential Points* lower fascicle says: "Explaining pure-mixed meaning, due to increase-decrease being different. Only depending on proximate perceived-portion explained. If depending on reflection-object, again the explanation differs. Within reflections, own-stage transformation is pure, supernatural power inducement is mixed. Within non-supernatural power, the eight manifest are pure, conditioning seeds are mixed." [Above is *Essential Points* text]

Explanation: Within proximate perceived-portion, if object and mind are same nature, same stage, this is named pure. Reversing this is named mixed. Within eighth [consciousness] aspects, own-stage transformation is pure, supernatural power inducement is mixed. Within non-supernatural power, if the eighth consciousness conditions manifest objects, this is named pure, because it conditions own-stage. If conditioning seeds, this is named mixed, because it pervades three realms. Now in this chapter, provisionally explaining pure-mixed according to the former meaning. Body being in desire realm arousing upper great elements must be through meditative power inducement, hence named "mixed production." Transforming desire realm great [elements] is own-stage transformation, hence named "pure production." When inducing those form realm four great elements to arise, desire realm own-stage pure production living great elements cease, form realm meditative inducement mixed production great elements arise. Because desire realm form is coarse, form realm great elements supplement within the body. Like water entering sand, location not different. Hence not different dwelling.

Question: Within desire realm body, are there gaps first, with form realm great elements coming to enter within?

【Lower Section】
Explanation: Master Guang says: Not so. Future desire realm body naturally has two types. First, only desire great elements. Second, mixed with form realm great elements. When encountering conditions for entering form realm meditation, those with only desire realm great elements immediately cease, those mixed with form realm immediately arise. Hence cannot say gaps exist first with later coming dwelling within. As Master Guang's *Abhidharmakośa Commentary* fascicle nine explains. Now saying "pure-mixed" meaning is also the same. Question: This pure-mixed meaning - is it only in the base consciousness, or does it also pervade other consciousnesses?

Explanation: It also pervades other consciousnesses. Hence *Essential Points* says: "Within seventh consciousness can be named reflection pure-mixed. Reflection explains nature from seeing-object. In five consciousnesses, good-evil are mixed, neutral mind is pure. Sixth [consciousness] with five-simultaneous, etc. all pervade and should be contemplated."

Question: By what can one know that own-stage transformation is pure and meditative power inducement is mixed?

Explanation: *Essential Points* says: "Furthermore separately there are material-immaterial pairs, conditioned-unconditioned pairs, contaminated-uncontaminated pairs, own-realm other-realm conditioning pairs. Contemplate pure-mixed." [Above is *Essential Points* text]

Explanation: In this chapter, provisionally explaining pure-mixed meaning according to own-realm other-realm conditioning pairs. Hence it is known: own-stage transformation is pure, meditative power inducement is mixed. This mixed-pure meaning is extensively explained as in *Vijñapti Commentary* fascicle ten.

From "One interpretation considers this" to "hence conforming approach." Among two explanations in the answer, this is the second master's doctrine. Which master is not detailed. This master explains: *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-four says "like water situated in sand dwelling in different places." In the text, because nature and type differ, it is not same-place non-separation. That it is the meaning of mixed non-separation is because this fifty-four text immediately serves as a conforming rational approach. The reason for this is that regarding

The meaning of sequential generation is called "separate production." Transcending [sequential] mutual generation is called "universal production." Now I think this is not so. The commentary describes two explanations: first, the meaning of separate establishment is called "separate production"; later, the meaning of comprehensive establishment is called "universal production." If based on the first meaning: form produces fire, fire produces eye, [but] the eye does not see fire but sees form. Sound produces space, space produces ear, [but] the ear does not hear space but hears sound. Smell produces earth, earth produces nose, [but] the nose does not smell earth but smells fragrance. Taste produces water, water produces tongue, [but] the tongue does not obtain water but tastes flavor. Touch produces wind, wind produces body, [but] the body does not obtain wind but obtains touch. This is the meaning of separate establishment, called "separate production." If based on the latter meaning: the five subtle [elements] comprehensively produce the five great [elements], and the five great [elements] comprehensively produce the five faculties. This is the meaning of comprehensive establishment, called "universal production." Extensive interpretation of that school is as in Master Daijō-ki's *Vijñaptimātra Treatise Commentary* volume one and Master Daijō-kō's *Abhidharmakośa Commentary* volume three.

The Sound Theorists say that sound is either "manifestation-permanent" or "production-permanent." This fourth [section] describes the Sound Theory school. "Sound is either manifestation-permanent or production-permanent": Treatise volume one says: "Some hold that all sounds are permanent. Depending on conditions for manifestation and arousal, [they] then have semantic expression." Depending on conditions for manifestation refers to sound-manifestation. Depending on conditions for arousal refers to sound-production. "Arousal" means production. All sounds are permanent, but sometimes [there are] intervals and [they are] not heard because [they] depend on conditions for semantic expression, thus [they] manifest and arise. The *Hetuvidyā Commentary* says: "Among Sound Theorists, there are generally two types: first, sound arises from conditions and is permanently indestructible; second, sound is originally permanent and manifested through conditions, now becoming audible. When conditional resonance ceases, [it] cannot be heard. Sound-production is also thus - when conditions cease, [it is] not heard; when conditions exist, [it is] heard." Now saying "manifestation-permanent" refers to

the Sound-Manifestation Theorists. "Production-permanent" refers to the Sound-Production Theorists. Question: Do these two theorists acknowledge that sound is produced by great elements? Explanation: Since [they] already say "depending on conditions for manifestation and arousal," the so-called conditions are conditions like sound-resonance, not great elements. Therefore we know that various sounds are not produced by great elements. However, according to their school's intention, sound-resonance is also not produced by great elements. Through vitarka-vicāra etc., [they] are aroused, not created by great [elements]. Therefore we know that in their school, conditions like sound-resonance are not produced by great [elements]. Now this [text] describes this doctrine to reveal the differences among various schools.

The Mahāsāṅghika school says there are no separate five faculties, being identical to the four sense-objects, hence [they] permit [this for] the Buddha. From here below, the second [section] narrates Abhidharma explanations. [It] briefly indicates seven schools. This is the initial description of the Mahāsāṅghika school. "No separate five faculties, being identical to the four sense-objects": In the *Samayabhedoparacanacakra*, describing the Mahāsāṅghika school: "The five material faculties have flesh-masses as their essence. The eye does not see forms, up to the body does not sense touch." Explanation: In the contract sūtras, [it] explains that the eye is produced by great elements, up to each separately being of solid nature and solid type. Therefore we know that the five material faculties like the eye all have flesh-masses as essence, without separate pure forms. Because [they are] not pure forms, faculties do not apprehend objects. Only consciousness understands; faculties have no capability. This corresponds to the "consciousness-perceives" position in the *Abhidharmakośa*. Since [it] already says "having flesh-masses as essence," flesh-masses are precisely the four sense-objects of form, smell, taste, and touch, with no separate essence. Hence saying "no separate five faculties, being identical to the four sense-objects." The remaining text can be understood.

The *Satyasiddhi Treatise* says the four sense-objects are producers and also only produced. This second [section] describes the *Satyasiddhi Treatise* school - namely the Later Sautrāntika Harivarman, called "Lion-Armor," the doctrine of the *Satyasiddhi Treatise* author. Therefore

that treatise's third fascicle, Chapter on Form Characteristics, says: "The four great [elements] are earth, water, fire, wind. Due to form, smell, taste, touch, [they] constitute the four great [elements]. Due to these four great [elements], [they] form the five faculties like the eye. When these mutually touch, there is sound." Now taking the meaning and pointing to the treatise text, hence saying "four sense-objects are producers etc." "Sound is also only produced": The four sense-objects produce great [elements], but sound does not produce great [elements]. Only when the four great [elements] etc. mutually touch is there sound. Hence saying "sound is also only produced." Now saying "also" is in relation to the five faculties. Question: Among the three - four great [elements], four sense-objects, five faculties - depending on which dharma is sound produced? Explanation: Only the four great [elements] produce sound. Those five faculties and four sense-objects do not produce sound. The reason for this: the four sense-objects are real forms, being exactly one moment, hence cannot produce sound. The five faculties are multiple-void, also not producing sound. The four great [elements] are provisional forms, thus pervading continuity and also not being multiple-void, hence able to produce sound. Therefore in the *Satyasiddhi Treatise*'s Chapter on Sound Characteristics, [it] only explains "four great [elements] are causes of form-sound," not explaining "other dharmas are also causes of sound." However, when the treatise text says "these mutually touching have sound," [this is] to clarify that the four sense-objects produce the four great [elements], the four great [elements] produce the five faculties, and through touching [they] form cause-effect [relationships], with no separate essence, hence generally explaining "this mutual touching." Extensively as in the treatise commentary text.

The Sarvāstivāda masters [say] the four great [elements] are producers and only defiled, forms are produced. This third [section] describes the Sarvāstivāda school. "Four great [elements] are producers and only defiled etc.": Within this school, [they] explain the differences between the two aspects of great elements and derived forms. [They] briefly indicate eleven approaches. Therefore *Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā* 127 says: "Abhidharma treatise-masters say: Great elements are invisible, derived forms are visible-invisible. Great elements are obstructive, derived forms are obstructive-non-obstructive. Great elements are defiled, derived forms are defiled-undefiled. Great elements are morally neutral, derived forms are wholesome-unwholesome-

neutral. Great elements are bound to desire-form realms, derived forms are bound to desire-form realms and unbound. Great elements are neither-learner-nor-non-learner, derived forms are learner-non-learner-neither-learner-nor-non-learner. Great elements are eliminated through cultivation, derived forms are eliminated through cultivation or not eliminated. Great elements are included in suffering-origination truths, derived forms are included in suffering-origination-path truths. Great elements have no maturation, derived forms have maturation or no maturation. Great elements are undefiled, derived forms are defiled-undefiled. Great elements are not karma, derived forms are karma or not karma. Such differences between the two aspects of great elements and derived forms have immeasurable approaches." Now in this chapter, [it] briefly indicates the second and third approaches, hence saying "only defiled, only obstructive." Saying "obstructive" means contact-obstruction. "Included in touch-base": If following their school, the real entities of the touch-base are eleven types: namely the four great elements and seven types of derived touch. "Seven types of derived touch" means: smooth, rough, light, heavy, cold, hunger, thirst. Smooth means fine-warm, rough means coarse-strong, light means unweighable, heavy means weighable, cold means being pressed by this then arousing warmth-seeking, hunger means being pressed by this then arousing food-desire, thirst means being pressed by this then arousing drink-desire. Question: Which great elements increasing [cause] smooth up to thirst? Explanation: The *Vibhāṣā* has two explanations. Some masters say: water-fire increasing [causes] smooth, earth-wind increasing [causes] rough, fire-wind increasing [causes] light, earth-water increasing [causes] heavy. Therefore the *Prajñapti Treatise* says: Question: Why is the body light and harmonious when alive, but heavy and discordant when dead? Answer: When alive, fire-wind have not yet perished, hence the body is light and harmonious. After death, fire-wind in the body have already perished, hence heavy and discordant. Water-wind increasing [causes] cold, wind increasing [causes] hunger - namely wind increasing causes systematic movement and food digestion, inducing hunger-touch to arise, then arousing food-desire. Fire increasing [causes] thirst - namely fire increasing causes pressing and drink consumption

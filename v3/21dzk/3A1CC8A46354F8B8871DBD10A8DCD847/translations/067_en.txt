naming [it] 'emptiness and no-self.' This is the shared characteristic of all dharmas." Because the essence of emptiness and no-self is non-existent dharma, it can serve as expedient designation for suchness. Hence, from the designation of expedient two emptinesses, using [it] as a name, [it] also explains suchness as being named shared characteristic. Or [it] explains: "Suchness is manifested by the two emptinesses, not being the two emptinesses themselves. The two emptinesses themselves are shared characteristics of all dharmas. Because all dharmas are without self." Hence, suchness manifested by the two emptinesses - this suchness has real substance, which is precisely self-characteristic.

"This master's intention explains... not shared characteristics": This is text added by the chapter master. "Expedient means" refers to the preparatory mind stage before entering concentration - first abiding in this stage and conditioning shared characteristics, then later entering the concentrated stage, only conditioning self-characteristics, not conditioning shared characteristics. That is, explaining the former stage as expedient means. This master's intention explains: All concentrated minds only condition self-characteristics. This is because [they] are direct perception. However, explaining that concentrated mind conditions shared characteristics is because [it] can eliminate afflictions, while the *Abhidharmasamuccaya* etc. explaining that total-conditioning attention eliminates afflictions refers to expedient means, hence no contradiction. These above two explanations are both not correct doctrine.

"The third master says... all called direct perception": From here below, third[ly] [it]述べる the treatise master's correct doctrine. "That *Pramāṇa* treatise etc." refers to the *Nyāyamukha* and *Nyāyapraveśa*, which have no extensive explanations of the two characteristics. Only the *Nyāyamukha* says: "For one's own words, [there are] only direct perception and inference. Those [like] verbal analogy etc. are included within these, hence only two valid cognitions. Through these [one] can understand self and shared characteristics, hence apart from these

two there are no separate objects of cognition. To understand those, [one does] not additionally establish other valid cognitions." Now saying "that *Pramāṇa* treatise" probably refers to the *Pramāṇasamuccaya* of *Pramāṇa* [theory]. What enables [one] to know [this], Master Mai says: "The self and shared characteristics established by that *Pramāṇasamuccaya* of *Pramāṇa* [theory] differ slightly from this sūtra. That treatise's explanation [is that] all real meanings of suffering, impermanence, etc. on all dharmas all attach to substance and are named self-characteristics. Because self and shared characteristics on various dharmas each attach to their own substance and do not share with others. Like the obstructive characteristic of form-base is form's self-characteristic, while suffering, impermanence, etc. are form's shared characteristics. Though divided into self and shared on form, each attaches to form's substance and does not share with sound etc., hence knowing self and shared characteristics on form. In the *Pramāṇasamuccaya*, [they are] all named self-characteristics and completely included in direct perception. If in discriminating scattered mind [one] establishes one category as designation capability, naming suffering, impermanence, etc. as designated [objects]. The meanings of suffering, impermanence, etc. follow from designation capability, being manifestations of discriminating scattered mind. Through this, these suffering, impermanence, etc. are also universally present in eleven bases. Like using one thread to string various flowers - flowers following the thread are all named shared characteristics. This essentially being provisionally established in scattered mind discrimination is inferential cognition's object. All concentrated minds, regardless of ordinary beings or sages, all separate from this discrimination and are entirely named direct perception." Extensively as explained in that master's *Buddhabhūmiśāstra* commentary.

"Though conditioning various dharmas... because of non-identity and non-difference": "Though conditioning various dharmas' suffering, impermanence, etc." means: Though conditioning various dharmas' suffering, impermanence, etc. of eleven bases, also on each base there are respectively suffering, impermanence, etc., self-attaching to dharma substance, hence naming this impermanence as self-characteristic. Though suchness is manifested by the shared characteristics of two emptinesses and no-self,

though manifested by shared characteristics, because [it] is the self-nature of all dharmas, [it] has its own substance and characteristics and is also not shared characteristic. Also, one cannot name suchness as shared characteristic of all dharmas because suchness and all dharmas are non-identical and non-different. Self-characteristics are also non-identical and non-different with all shared characteristics, hence one cannot also explain self-characteristics as shared characteristics. Like form's obstructive characteristic being self-characteristic is also non-identical and non-different with shared characteristics of impermanence etc.

"This meaning intends to say... because of capable understanding": "Generally being manifested by my shared characteristics" - this indicates the shared characteristic observation of the *Daśabhūmika*sūtra. "Each separately verified substance is self-characteristic" - this indicates the self-characteristic observation of *Pramāṇa* [theory]. "Can universally serve as capable elimination by two observations" - this generally manifests the intentions of *Buddhabhūmi* and *Pramāṇa* [theory]. "Capable manifestation is shared characteristic etc." - this reiterates the above meaning. If depending on this doctrine, self and shared characteristics already have two approaches. If concerning sūtra explanations of self and shared characteristics, [one] should say observations conditioning shared characteristics can eliminate afflictions. Because impermanence observation can eliminate delusions, [saying] total-conditioning attention can eliminate delusions is precisely this meaning. If concerning *Pramāṇa* [theory's] self and shared characteristics, [one] should say only self-characteristic observation can eliminate afflictions. Because all concentrated minds condition self-characteristics.

"*Pratītyasamutpāda*sūtra below... hence no contradiction": This reconciles contradictions. "Within one moment below" is the chapter master's text. If concerning *Pramāṇa* [theory], only self-characteristic observation can eliminate afflictions, why does the *Pratītyasamutpāda*sūtra say "True reality's noble wisdom is total characteristic and total conditioning, hence named sudden complete realization"? Hence now reconciling [it] says: If dharma-patience's one-moment wisdom from previous preparatory [practice] is named total-characteristic conditioning, [it is because] in the previous preparatory stage

[it] creates emptiness and no-self aspects. This precisely depends on *Pramāṇa* [theory] to reconcile the *Pratītyasamutpāda*sūtra text. In the *Buddhabhūmi* treatise, [it] does not quote the *Pratītyasamutpāda*sūtra to reconcile its contradictory text. Saying "*Buddhabhūmi* reconciles [it] itself" means the *Buddhabhūmi* treatise volume six says: "Therefore that treatise explains all real meanings on various dharmas as all named self-characteristics. This sūtra is not like this. Hence no contradiction." Master Mai says: "Therefore that *Pramāṇa* treatise explains real meanings on various dharmas, with names attached to self-substance, all named self-characteristics. This sūtra is not like this. Like suffering, impermanence, etc. of eleven bases - though not identical, suffering, impermanence, etc. are mutually similar and named shared characteristics." In the *Buddhabhūmi* treatise, [it] raises the intentions of *Pramāṇa* [theory] and the *Daśabhūmika*sūtra, with that [treatise] itself providing reconciliation. Hence no contradiction. Question: What distinctions are there between the two characteristics explained in *Buddhabhūmi*, *Vijñaptimātra*, and *Pramāṇa* treatises? Explanation: Master Huizhao says: "*Buddhabhūmi* treatise's intention names the five aggregates etc. as self-characteristics and suffering, impermanence, etc. as shared characteristics. In the *Vijñaptimātra* treatise, [what] carries verbal designation is named shared characteristic, [what] cannot be verbally designated is named self-characteristic. In *Pramāṇa* treatises, universal [characteristics] are named shared characteristics, particular [characteristics] are named self-characteristics. This has four pairs explaining the two characteristics, as explained in the elimination [section]."

"Question: These various afflictions... because of binding objects": This raises a question based on *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-nine. Saying "from what is [it] explained as elimination" precisely questions the source of elimination. That is, among associated binding and objective binding, from which does [one] explain elimination? *Commentary* volume ten [says]: "Question: This talk of elimination - does [it] eliminate objective binding or eliminate associated binding? Answer: If [regarding] cognitive obscurations,

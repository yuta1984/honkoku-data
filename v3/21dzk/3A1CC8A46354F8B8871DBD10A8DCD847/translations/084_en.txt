Regarding moments, being in the same time, having one consciousness as essence - therefore obtaining the name "mutually being cause and effect." This clarifies that seeds and ālaya facing other manifestations serve as simultaneous causes. Now this chapter author's intention: when seeds face manifestations, [they are] not simultaneous causes, but also become productive, simultaneous, corresponding, and universal [causes]. That is, seed-causes have the function of producing results, hence named "productive." Because this cause is broad, it also serves as cause for simultaneous result-dharmas, hence named "simultaneous." Mental factors being mutually accordant, equally taking object-conditions, hence named "corresponding." Seeds in consciousness producing correspondence, hence named "corresponding cause." Speaking of "universal": "universal" means pervasive meaning, "activity" is the name for cause. Causes can actualize results. Or again, "activity" means condition-meaning. Universally conditioning defiled dharmas, also like greed-seeds, immediately able to increase anger and other servant-seeds, causing their growth. All other categories of servant-seeds are also the same. However, it's not only defilement-seeds that increase seeds - seeds also can increase manifestations. Seeds facing manifestations possess four causes. Seeds facing manifestations have mutually distinct natures. Also being simultaneous but not similar-type causes. Master Kuo says: manifestation-seed mutual production, and previous-moment manifestation-seeds facing later manifestation-seeds, extending to both proximate and distant [relations] - those simultaneously arising and being of similar type are all similar-type causes. Among Yogācāra's ten causes, arising-cause meaning extends to both proximate and distant. The major meaning of simultaneous and successive [relations] is similar-type cause meaning. Also saying: arising causes having equal-flow results are called "result-having dharmas." Using this text to prove that both simultaneous and successive [relations] are all similar-type causes. Question: If manifestation and seed mutually produce but their natures are already distinct, how are they similar-type? Explaining: functional-difference seeds extend to the three natures and are also similar-type. Question: Manifestation and seed being simultaneous - what's the difference between simultaneous and similar-type, these two causes? Explaining: essence is the same, but functions

have differences. Like mind and mental factors' correspondence and simultaneity. This is also thus. "Seeds facing seeds" etc.: seed-succession with self-type mutual production immediately becomes similar-type. Yet there's no retribution. All are retribution causes but not causal conditions.

From "greats facing derived matter" to "sensing those results": "Greats facing derived matter are all not six causes" - great elements and derived matter are all manifest dharmas. Manifest-manifest mutual dependence are all not causal conditions. Hence depending on causal conditions, and among the six causes, greats facing derived matter are all not causal conditions. "Derived [matter] facing great elements becoming retribution cause" - for example, like derived wholesome-unwholesome non-manifest karma, able to sense those neutral great-element results. Hence derived [matter] facing great elements becomes retribution cause. Though being manifestations, intimately mutually depending and sensing, hence provisionally named causal conditions. Hence depending on causal conditions, among distinguishing six causes, derived [matter] facing manifest great elements becomes retribution cause. This retribution cause universally senses present-future true-provisional retribution. However, *Abhidharma* treatise volume four says: attracting-including the future, uniformly non-similar, neutral unobscured self-essence included retribution results - [this] temporarily speaks about superior recompense. Hence attracting future true distinct recompense. Causes are also included in this cause. Extensively as explained in Masters Ji and Fan's *Abhidharma* extracts.

From "now depending on dominant [conditions]" to "not seeds facing seeds": First, productive causes etc. - *Yogācāra* and *Madhyāntavibhāga* explain ten productives, not exceeding *Abhidharma*'s twenty productives. This cause being broadly universal hence pervades all causes. Cause-essences have functions able to produce results. Regarding cause-essence, establishing productive names. For derived matter's seeds and manifestations, giving power within, not mutually obstructing. This is great elements having productive functions toward their derived [matter], serving as their cause meaning. Second, similar-type causes etc. - *Abhidharma*

says: enhancement cause - by previous-boundary manifest three-nature dharmas nourishing three-nature seeds in mind, causing their enhancement, hence named "enhancement." Enhancement is immediately result. Also possible that causes having enhancement power produce enhanced results - enhancement belongs to cause. Previous-moment dharmas able to serve later moments, being same-nature similar, serving as causes for result-dharma growth, hence also called similar-type causes. Now saying "causing growth" explains enhancement meaning. In *Abhidharma* texts etc. - explaining that treatise, this chapter's perspective differs in meaning. Generally, similar-type causes have three categories: first, seed-manifestation mutual production; second, seed-seed mutual production; third, manifestation-manifestation mutual production. That *Abhidharma* treatise, regarding seeds producing manifestations, explains similar-type causes, hence saying "attracting later results to arise." Speaking of "later results" means manifest results, not meaning later-moment seeds facing previous-moment seeds being named results. Hence Master Fan's commentary explaining "successive arising texts" says: in the future, descending and arising, manifesting "later-moment manifestations etc. produced from seeds" etc. Hence knowing: attracting later results to arise means manifest results. Now in this chapter, greats facing derived matter having similar-type causes also depends on manifestation mutual-facing explanations, not seeds facing seeds.

From "third, simultaneous causes" to "one result meaning": Third, simultaneous causes - *Abhidharma* says: companion causes are dharmas mutually assisting, having power, determinedly co-operating, named companions. *Abhidharma* manifests functions hence says companions. Great elements and derived matter necessarily arise simultaneously, hence becoming simultaneous causes. Though this cause extends to matter, mind, and mental factors etc., here briefly depending on productive-produced matter for explanation. Following their clusters, whether one productive great [element] or one produced matter also necessarily co-operate. Mutually assisting, not obtaining

mutual separation. Also this text only regarding productives mutually being companions. True greats facing great elements, derived [matter] facing derived matter - simultaneous arising being determinate, also named companions. Like conceptualization and sensation mutually facing - though being same mental factors, also named companions. Material dharmas also thus. This speaks of simultaneous causes regarding mutual result meaning, not meaning obtaining same results. In Hīnayāna schools, *Vibhāṣā* evaluators say: four great elements' essences, whether having partial enhancement or lacking partial enhancement - earth serves as simultaneous cause for three [others], three serve as simultaneous causes for earth. Why? Earth doesn't contemplate earth producing derived matter. All dharmas don't awaken to self-nature and similar-type essences serving as other-causes. Up to wind great elements also thus. Following *Vibhāṣā* sixteen's evaluators, saying "same one result meaning is simultaneous cause meaning." Also *Nyāyānusāra* fifteen says: conditioned dharmas' one-dharma results can become simultaneous causes. The two treatises' meanings are same. *Nyāyānusāra* treatise's meaning: taking mutual results as naming simultaneous causes has faults. Further explaining: among conditioned dharmas, having successive power, obtaining same results are named simultaneous causes. Following *Abhidharmāvatāra* treatise: all conditioned dharmas mutually become results or same results, named simultaneous causes. *Kośa*'s Master Guang says: that treatise's later composition saying "mutually becoming results" studies my Ācārya Vasubandhu. Now distinguishing Hīnayāna's obtaining same results meaning, manifesting mutual result meaning, hence saying "not meaning obtaining same results."

From "not mind and mental factors" to "no universal causes": This distinguishes other causes. No corresponding causes. *Abhidharma* says: equal-activity causes are mind and mental factors equally proceeding toward previous objects, hence named

"One should distinguish and explain, up to mind-seeing path, etc.": Below [the text] explains the gradual or sudden [nature] of elimination. Regarding "one mind, three minds, etc.": The seeing path has two [types]. First is the essence of the true seeing path: departing from delusory appearances, it can personally realize principle and truly can eliminate obstacles. Hence [it is] called true. Another interpretation: true is principle, seeing is characteristics. Because [it is] wisdom that realizes the true, [it is] called true seeing. Regarding explaining this elimination and realization, the treatise has two explanations. One position: Within this, [one] gradually realizes the two emptiness and two obstacles and gradually eliminates [them], because there are differences of shallow-deep and coarse-subtle. This takes realizing three minds as the true seeing path; apart from three minds there is no separate one mind. Another position: Within this, [one] suddenly realizes the two emptiness and two obstacles and suddenly eliminates [them], because the power of intention has capability. This explains one mind as the true seeing path. Second is the resembling seeing path: "resembling" means the meaning of similarity. [It] arises after the true seeing path. Outside this practice, [it] imitates and models the functions possessed by true seeing, but cannot realize principle or eliminate obstacles. Because [it] resembles the true, [it is] called resembling seeing.

This again has two [types]: First, observing non-established truths has three grades of mind - namely the three [minds] of inner elimination of sentient being conceptualization, conditioned wisdom, etc. Second, observing established truths has sixteen minds - namely the sixteen of suffering dharma-knowledge patience, etc. Among the former three minds, there are also two explanations. One says: These three are true seeing, because the resembling seeing path takes the four truths as objects. One says: These three are resembling seeing, because the true seeing path does not take separate objects. Do these three-mind seeing paths extend to the two vehicles? One explanation says only to bodhisattvas. One explanation says [they] extend to the two vehicles. The three minds only eliminate self-grasping, because in the first mind [they] eliminate the self apart from aggregates, in the second mind [they] eliminate the self identical with aggregates, and in the third mind [they] abandon the two coarse burdens, thus constituting three minds.

Also, Master Haie of Nalanda Monastery explains these three minds as not being only the bodhisattva seeing path but also being [that of] the two vehicles. Why is this? Because initially [one] separately observes selflessness on dharmas, making selflessness practice-observation, called eliminating sentient being conceptualization. Next [one] makes emptiness practice, eliminating dharma conceptualizations belonging to self and removing self-possession grasping - this is called the second elimination of dharma conceptualization. The third conceptualization is self and dharmas belonging to self; repeatedly observing self and self-possessions, because [it is] inferior grade emptiness, [it is] called pervasive elimination of two conceptualizations. However, now taking only the Mahayana as superior follows Master Ji's *Yogācāra Commentary*. Those who accept three minds as true - this is truly successive elimination. Those who explain three minds as resembling - this is provisional, not real.

Now, "one grade elimination" means that though discriminative two obstacles have nine grades, because within the true seeing path [they] are eliminated suddenly as one grade, [it is] called one grade elimination. "Two grade elimination" means that regarding self-grasping, the first mind eliminates the first grade of self-grasping, and in the third mind eliminates the second grade of self-grasping. Because there are only lower and upper [grades] without middle grade, [it is] called two grade elimination. Dharma-grasping is likewise: the second mind eliminates the first grade of dharma-grasping, and in the third mind eliminates the second grade of dharma-grasping. Hence [it is] called two grade elimination. However, that the first mind eliminates the middle grade means, in relation to the previous self-grasping, [it is] called middle grade. Also, from the counteracting path, [it is] explained and called middle grade. Like calling the first grade truly soft - [this] is also explained and called soft from the counteracting path. If regarding the affliction essence, [it] is superior grade.

"Only the non-defiled correct, up to neighboring pride": That defiled various paths do not subdue view-afflictions refers to six-practice wisdom, etc., not preparatory wisdom. "The *Yogācāra* treatise says," etc.: *Yogācāra* fifty-

eight explains that worldly paths only subdue innate love, hatred, and neighboring pride, not saying [they] can subdue discriminative afflictions. This refers to ordinary beings, two vehicle [practitioners], etc. If direct-path bodhisattvas, those obstacles' manifest arising is already subdued before [reaching the] grounds.

"This depends on six practices, up to because power does not function": "This depends on six practices," etc. - according to *Yogācāra* fifty-eight's intention, depending on six practices, etc., [it] explains [they] cannot subdue. If preparatory wisdom, [it] also can subdue them. That bodhisattvas before grounds also subdue discriminative manifestation from arising - view-afflictions, etc. have two [types]: first, those arising depending on one's own discrimination; second, those arising depending on heterodox teachers' instructions. Now saying "subdue from arising" refers to one's own discrimination. Those arising due to heterodox teachings cannot yet be subdued. The *Avatamsaka Sutra's* fourth dwelling bodhisattva permanently departing from three realm afflictions, etc., refers to self-power arising and making such explanation, hence [there is] no contradiction.

"Among six consciousnesses' divisions, up to lower *Essential Pivot* explains": "One grade elimination," etc. - as already explained before. "Which among nine grades [are] eliminated first," etc. - among discriminative nine grades, which [are] eliminated first and which eliminated later? Namely, wrong-thinking arising [are] eliminated first, wrong-teaching arising [are] eliminated later. Or [one] reverses this explanation. Like continuing good roots: those depending on wrong teaching continue first because their force is weak; those depending on wrong thinking continue later because their force is firm. Another interpretation: self-apart-from-aggregates conceptualization [is] eliminated first because [it is] coarse; self-identical-with-aggregates conceptualization [is] eliminated later because [it is] subtle. Another interpretation: [it is] indefinite - each ground has coarse and subtle; coarse [ones are] eliminated first, subtle [ones] eliminated later. "As treatise nine, lower *Essential Pivot* explains" - this text seems to point to the passage where *Essential Pivot's* lower fascicle explains treatise nine, but examining where *Essential Pivot's*

【Lower Section】
lower [fascicle] explains treatise nine's passage, this text is completely absent. Only at treatise ten's passage does [it] explain elimination's succession. Based on this, interpreting this text, [one] should say "like treatise nine, with lower *Essential Pivot* explains." The reason for this: treatise nine explains one grade elimination, etc., one mind three minds, etc. Also, *Essential Pivot's* lower fascicle explains that within treatise ten, [it] explains discriminative nine grades elimination's succession. That text says: However, the two obstacles of cognitive and afflictive [obstacles] each divide into two. What are the two? If using nine grades, coarse grades [are] eliminated first - namely ten grounds' cultivation path should first eliminate the coarse. If following obstructed paths to distinguish coarse and subtle, nine grounds are indefinite. Up to saying: Within the seeing path, self-discriminative power's coarse [is] eliminated first; other-induced power is subtle, hence eliminated later, etc. Extensively as that explains.

"Within those six consciousnesses, up to each [has] nine grade elimination": Below [this] generally reveals the two obstacles' elimination's gradual or sudden [nature]. Within [this] there are two [parts]: first clarifying afflictive obstacles' elimination's gradual or sudden [nature], later [clarifying] cognitive obstacles' elimination's gradual or sudden [nature]. Within the first there are also two [parts]: first interpreting the six consciousnesses, later from "within the seventh consciousness" onward interpreting the seventh consciousness. Regarding the six consciousnesses, first clarifying latent afflictions' gradual or sudden [nature], later from "however, within the six consciousnesses" onward clarifying habitual tendencies' elimination's gradual or sudden [nature]. This is the beginning. According to treatise ten, generally discussing the two obstacles' elimination's gradual or sudden [nature], there are three types: First, exclusively sudden elimination - namely discriminative two obstacles within six consciousnesses, and seventh consciousness's afflictive and cognitive [obstacles], according to their correspondence, [with] three vehicles' true seeing and vajra-mind, [being] eliminated simultaneously. Second, exclusively gradual elimination - namely innate cognitive [obstacles] within six consciousnesses [that] bodhisattvas [eliminate in] ten

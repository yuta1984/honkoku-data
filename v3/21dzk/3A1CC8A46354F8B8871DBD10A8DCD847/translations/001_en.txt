　　　Forest of Meanings on the Five Minds

The text states "from the five minds such as sudden (satsui) to the five uniform-flow minds." Regarding the establishment of minds, various schools hold different views. The Sthavira masters establish the nine-mind wheel, beginning from the bhavanga-mind and ending with the mind that returns to existence, as extensively explained in the second volume of the Mahāyānasamgraha and the Kuo commentary. The later Sautrāntika master Harivarman establishes four types of mind: consciousness, sensation, perception, and formation. They say that sensation and others are all distinctions of mind that arise successively, and there are no separate sensations existing apart from mind that arise together with mind. Now, according to the Mahāyāna, only five minds are established. In Sanskrit it is called "citta," which translates as "mind." Mind has various meanings, including the meaning of "collecting and arising." Because there are many types of nature and class that collect and give rise to all dharmas, it is called mind. Particularly referring to the eighth consciousness, but generally applying to all consciousnesses. When this mind arises, there are only five stages - neither nine nor four. Therefore it is called the five minds.

The initial "sudden" (satsui) means abrupt. This initial mind abruptly falls into the object-realm, which is called "sudden falling." "Seeking" means contemplative seeking, and "searching" means investigative searching. That is, in the realm where the initial mind has fallen, contemplating and investigating is called the seeking mind. "Deciding" means determination, and "settling" means confirmation. Regarding the realm that the second mind has sought, making decisions and confirmations is called the determining mind. "Defiled" means polluted, namely unwholesome nature and covered-neutral. "Pure" means clean, namely wholesome nature and uncovered-neutral. After the third mind gains determination regarding its object-realm, at this stage the defiled or pure nature is first established, called the defiled-pure mind. "Equal" means uniform, and "flow" means category. Because the fourth mind has already established the defiled or pure nature, being drawn by that, in this current stage it is either wholesome or defiled, with uniform categories. This is called the uniform-flow mind. Because it flows equally to the previous, it is called uniform-flow mind. It should be known that the word "mind" also includes mental factors, because they necessarily correspond. Now, following the primary and superior, it is called only "mind." When the mind-king is called mind, it is a direct designation. When mental factors are called mind, they are named after the superior.

Regarding the text from the first volume of the Yogācārabhūmi "the same applies to body-consciousness." "Transformation into wholesome and unwholesome" clarifies that wholesome and evil are established only through dependence on the guiding power of the mental consciousness. Although the sudden arising of the five consciousnesses gives rise to mental consciousness, the uniform flow of the five consciousnesses establishes good and evil only by depending on mental power, hence "transformation into wholesome and unwholesome." Therefore the treatise says "the first six consciousnesses mutually give rise to each other." "Such as the arising of eye-consciousness" analogically explains ear-consciousness and others.

Regarding the text "through the initial three minds, actually including the latter two": The initial three minds have the same neutral nature, hence "same in nature and type." This is explained regarding neutral objects in the pre-transformation stage. If they are strong and superior objects, they encompass all three natures. However, in explaining this text, the chapter master provides two explanations. The first explanation is precisely this text. The second, according to the Gashō, says "explaining the initial three minds" is because when various minds arise, mostly three arise, while the latter two minds are indefinite. Although only three are mentioned, the words actually include the latter two. Master Kuo says that because the first three are neutral, "three" is mentioned, but the defiled-pure mind also has neutral aspects that are the same as the previous nature, so they are briefly omitted. This explanation is somewhat difficult. If the defiled-pure mind also has neutral aspects that are included in the first three without separate explanation, then the determining mind also has the same nature as the previous and should not be explained separately.

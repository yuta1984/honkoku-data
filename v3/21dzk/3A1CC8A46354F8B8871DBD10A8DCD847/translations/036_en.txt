Following each stage they all cultivate, therefore called "cultivation." Next, "seeking results" means namely pursuing the two fruits of wisdom and severance. Later, "knowing objects" means namely the objects that should be known: three natures, three non-arisings, etc. Therefore the *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* explains the three natures etc. as "what should be known." In this text now, because it explains the first two stages, it says "provisions and expedient path." In the first severance of obstructions, there is only suppression, not severance, therefore it says "rejection and abandonment." In the next cultivation, it only cultivates contaminated six perfections and other practices, therefore it says "cultivation and practice." In the next seeking results, the first provisions stage seeks liberation fruit, the later preparatory stage seeks decisive choice fruit, therefore it says "advancing pursuit." In the later knowing objects, based on similar observation, one understands the principle of existence and non-existence of the three natures, therefore it says "understanding and knowing." In the non-established, although dharmas are not non-existent, one cannot speak of them as causes or effects because mind and speech are cut off. If there were no conventional truth, how would bodhisattvas proceed through the five stages to cultivate pure practices? Due to this benefit, beyond the non-established, the established is later explained.

"From 'Question: if practices exist' to 'yet able to sever delusions'": This also relies on treatise text. In the answer text, from "extremely good concentrated mind" to "should attain ultimate pure liberation" is treatise text. From "with-characteristics mind" to "what difference is there ultimately" is the chapter master's explanatory text. Also "the two types of worldly and supramundane paths have distinctions" is treatise text. Therefore from "practicing with characteristics does not attain liberation, etc." below is the chapter master's explanatory text. Regarding "when turning to condition various truths in the good dharmas following decisive choice, etc.": According to Mahāyāna-ji's intention, namely based on this text, he proves that the highest worldly dharma extends through multiple moments. Therefore in Master Daxian's *Record of Ancient Traces on the Golden Light Sutra*, he refutes Mahāyāna-ji saying: Having already attained decisive choice, at what stage does one turn the mind? Ji says

it extends through four. Because the highest worldly dharma of the Mahāyāna school has multiple moments. What does he use as proof? Because it conditions various truths, one should not suddenly perform various truth practices - this is incorrect. It contradicts the *Abhidharmasamuccaya* saying "one moment." The previous thought cannot enter sainthood without interval, and would be like warmth etc., not the highest. Therefore by this, the fourth has no meaning of turning the mind. Now rescuing this, it says: The *Abhidharmasamuccaya* saying "one moment" is according to the accommodating principle approach, so there's no contradiction. By this we prove and know: non-discriminating wisdom definitely has no aspect-portion yet can sever delusions. In the *Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi* treatise fascicle nine, three masters explain: one says "this wisdom lacks both portions," one says "both aspect and seeing exist," the third master says "seeing exists but aspect does not." Now blocking the former two and proving the third as correct, therefore it says "by this we prove and know."

"From 'Question: merely establishing one' to 'explaining two is also thus'": Below there are two question-answers, both chapter master's text. "Gathering practices and returning to the ultimate, generally establishing one truth" - "practices" means conditioned practice-dharmas. "Ultimate" means the true principle of tathāgata-garbha. This explains the meaning of the one truth chapter of the *Śrīmālādevīsiṃhanāda-sūtra*. "One truth" means among the four noble truths, three are conventional, only one is ultimate. Because ultimate truth is only one, it's called "one truth." This is the sutra's meaning, based on the principle of tathāgata-garbha cessation truth. In fascicle 64, it explains "conventional has four levels, ultimate is only one truth." Now establishing two truths in opposition of ultimate and conventional. The *Renwang Sutra* also explains two thus, namely pointing to the meaning of the two truths chapter in that sutra's first fascicle. Extensively as explained there.

"From 'if following persons and dharmas' to 'all have three types'": *Nirvāṇa* fascicle 13, following the shallow and deep of wisdom and superior and inferior of dharmas, also explains two truths, as already explained before. "Or conventional and ultimate both have two truths" means knowing ultimate and

conventional truths each have general and particular. Knowing through general characteristics is called "middle wisdom," knowing through particular characteristics is called "superior wisdom." Whether ultimate or conventional, what middle wisdom knows is called "worldly truth," whether ultimate or conventional, what superior wisdom knows is called "ultimate meaning." Therefore in ultimate and conventional, both have two truths. "If using emptiness, phenomena, principle, etc." means namely in *Prakaraṇāryavāca-śāstra* fascicle 16, explaining the three natures etc. The first parikalpita nature is called emptiness, the next paratantra is called phenomena, the later pariṇiṣpanna is called principle. This is the same as the假 (provisional), 行 (conditioned), and 顕 (revealed) of the *Madhyāntavibhāga*. Namely parikalpita nature has no real nature, therefore called "provisional conventional truth." Paratantra nature is conditioned activity arising from conditions, therefore called "conditioned conventional." Pariṇiṣpanna nature's essence is thusness. Although called "revealed," it appears through dependence on others, therefore called "revealed conventional." This clarifies that conventional has three distinctions. Saying "meaning, attainment, practice" clarifies that ultimate also has three types. First, meaning-ultimate: namely that thusness is the object-meaning of superior wisdom. Second, attainment-ultimate: having nirvāṇa as essence. Because superior is namely meaning. Third, practice-ultimate: having noble path as essence. This noble path practice uses thusness superior dharmas as object-meaning, called "practice-ultimate." Now saying "in the two truths all have three types" means conventional has the three of provisional etc., ultimate has the three of meaning etc., therefore saying "all have three types." Extensively as explained in *Madhyāntavibhāga* fascicle two.

"From 'if using all dharmas' to 'therefore neither increase nor decrease'": "Existence and non-existence of all dharmas, phenomena and principle, etc." is as already explained before. Also "the Yogācāra commentary says, etc." means the intent of the True Meaning chapter in fascicle 36. Therefore that text says: "True meaning has briefly two types: first, the true nature of all dharmas based on how they exist; second, the totality of all dharmas based on as much as exists. Up to saying: This true meaning further has four

【Lower Section】
types: first, mundane extremely established reality... fourth, reality practiced by wisdom purified of cognitive obstructions." Now taking the meaning and quoting, therefore it says "mundane establishment, etc." Explaining: teaching that explains ultimate truth is called "nature of how things exist," teaching that explains conventional truth is called "nature of as much as exists." Since it says these two have four realities, it's clearly known that conventional and ultimate both have the four of mundane establishment etc. Therefore in the two truths, each has four levels. Saying "mundane establishment" - if explained according to the four levels of ultimate, means what mundane conventional wisdom knows. Earth is only earth, not fire etc. This earth is called "reality." Mundane reasoning has nature that is not false, therefore called "reality" - namely aggregates etc. If explained according to the four levels of conventional, dharma-essence is not necessarily existent. All mundane beings jointly permit verbal expression and grasp it as existent, therefore namely real self, dharmas, jars, basins etc. The remaining three levels are as extensively explained in *Vimalakīrtinirdeśa Commentary* fascicle one. "By this, conventional and ultimate truths are each divided into four types, etc." is chapter master's text. Question: Commentary fascicle one says: "The former four conventional truths, as explained in *Yogācārabhūmi* fascicle 64 and *Prakaraṇāryavāca-śāstra* fascicle 6. Although names differ, various treatises also have those four ultimate truths. Whether meaning or name, they don't exist in various treatises - only this treatise explains them, as in fascicle nine." Since it says "those four ultimate truths, whether meaning or name, don't exist in various treatises - only this treatise explains them," how can the Yogācāra commentary now say "conventional and ultimate both have the four of mundane establishment etc."? Explaining: other treatises generally combine and explain the four ultimates. This treatise separately opens and explains the four ultimates. Now regarding names and meanings, opening and separately explaining, therefore saying "only this treatise explains."

[apply to] both mundane and supramundane. If called "emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness liberation gates," these are only supramundane. Now, because [we] comprehensively extract the meaning, the text differs somewhat. Sarvāstivāda says that three samādhis and three liberation gates have different meanings respectively. *Vibhāṣā* says: Three samādhis apply to both defiled and non-defiled. Three liberation gates exist only in non-defiled. The reason for this is that defiled [states] have bondage; liberation means separation from bondage. Therefore liberation gates exist only in non-defiled. Master Xuanlong says: Three samādhis and three liberation gates are all non-defiled. *Yogācāra* treatise sixty-nine says: Four truths wisdom, dharma wisdom, categorical wisdom, etc. - nine wisdoms are only supramundane and only non-defiled. [He] immediately explains himself: Because three samādhis and three liberation gates are included in four truths wisdom, [we] know they are only non-defiled nature. Now I think this is not so. That three samādhis apply to both defiled and non-defiled is already clear in the text, as explained in *Prakaraṇāryavāca*. However, when *Yoga* treatise says "three samādhis are included in four truths wisdom," [it] mentions [their] application to non-defiled and does not discuss [their] application to defiled, therefore there is no contradiction.

"Therefore knowing three gates, up to four good preparatory practices": These three gate contemplations, though also applying to elimination, now particularly emphasize the meaning of suppression. Therefore it says "all can suppress afflictions." Among three gates, emptiness practice is broadest, therefore it properly suppresses afflictions. In principle, the other two practices can also suppress. "Depending on two emptiness gates to enter Mahāyāna stage, etc.": Three gate contemplative practices are common to three vehicles, therefore according to what [each] contemplates, [they] each enter their own vehicle's stage. If among three gate contemplations, [there is] only suppression and not elimination, [they] exist in four good roots. If [they] apply to both suppression and elimination, [they exist] above seeing path. Now clarifying suppression stage, therefore it says "this stage exists in four good preparatory practices."

"If proper elimination, up to 'relative unconditioned'": Speaking of "two practices" means emptiness practice and

non-self practice under suffering. Speaking of "ten practices" means suffering and impermanence under suffering, plus four under origination and four under path, combined as ten practices. Because [they are] equally conditioned, [they] constitute wishlessness. Speaking of "four practices" means four practices under cessation. This is precisely *Yogācāra* fascicle sixty-eight text, therefore it says "some explanation." Therefore that text says: Calling emptiness and non-self under suffering "emptiness liberation gate"; calling impermanence and suffering under suffering, four practices under origination, and four practices under path "wishlessness liberation gate"; calling four practices under cessation "signlessness liberation gate."

Question: Though path truth is conditioned, it is nevertheless a delightful place. Why use path's four [practices] as wishlessness?

Answer: This text is based on adaptive theoretical approach. In Sarvāstivāda school, when entering remainderless [nirvana], [they] abandon path truth, therefore those four practices also enter wishlessness. Another explanation: This is also Mahāyāna's true theoretical approach. Mahāyāna also permits fixed-nature two-vehicle [practitioners] to enter remainderless extinction, reducing body to ashes and extinguishing wisdom. What would prevent those four from also entering wishlessness?

"Some say emptiness thus, up to 'relative non-defiled'": This is *Abhidharma* treatise fascicle eleven text. Therefore that text says:
Question: Emptiness includes how many practices?
Answer: Six - namely impermanence practice, suffering practice, cause practice, origination practice, arising practice, condition practice. Because through them [there is] nothing to wish for in three realms.
Question: Signlessness includes how many practices?  
Answer: Eight - namely eight practices of cessation and path. Because through them [one] cannot create various characteristics.

Commentary: Though path truth's four practices are characterized, because [they are] non-defiled characteristics, [they are] called signlessness.

"Some say emptiness thus, up to 'therefore not signlessness'": This is precisely *Yogācāra* fifty-five text. Therefore that

text says: Among these sixteen practices, how many are emptiness practices? Namely, suffering truth's latter two practices. How many are wishlessness practices? Namely, also suffering truth's former two practices and all of origination truth. How many are signlessness practices? Namely, all of cessation truth. How many are practices manifested by pure causes? Namely, all of path truth.

Commentary: Suffering truth's latter two practices are emptiness practice and non-self practice. Now this text saying "path's four are not three gates, etc." means path truth in its entirety is manifested by pure causes and is not emptiness, etc. practices. Therefore [it] does not perform three gate contemplative practices. Because [it is] not suffering truth, [it is] not emptiness's object of practice. Because [it is] non-defiled, [it is] not wishlessness's object of practice. Because [it is] impermanent, [it is] not signlessness's object. However, *Abhidharma* treatise, because practice characteristics are quiescent, also calls [it] signlessness samādhi. Because objects and perspectives differ, there is no contradiction.

"*Prakaraṇāryavāca* second [fascicle], up to 'according to three gates' inclusion'": "Path can perform three gates, etc." - precisely that text says: Objectifying wisdom emptiness path, performing path, suchness, practice, exit - this is also emptiness practice. Objectifying wisdom signlessness path, performing path's four practices - this is also signlessness practice. Objectifying wisdom wishlessness path, performing path's four practices - this is also wishlessness practice. *Compilation* says: Examining this treatise's meaning, non-self and emptiness practices commonly belong to wishlessness. If following this text, emptiness and signlessness can eliminate and suppress; wishlessness only can suppress.

"Some say emptiness practice, up to 'accordingly same as before'": This is *Yogācāra* sixty-nine text. Therefore that text says: Emptiness gate is included in eight wisdoms - namely dharma, categorical, four truths, and supramundane exhaustion and non-arising wisdom. Wishlessness gate is included in six wisdoms - namely dharma, categorical, suffering, origination, exhaustion, and non-arising wisdom. Signlessness gate is included in five wisdoms - namely dharma, categorical, cessation, exhaustion, and non-arising wisdom. In *Compilation*, commentary says: Since emptiness gate already includes dharma, categorical, and four truths, [we] know [it] pervades sixteen [practices]. However, examining that text, dharma, categorical, and four truths should not object established truths. Within exhaustion and non-nature, because [they are] only supramundane, if so, [they] have not necessarily

objectified sixteen [practices]. [We] should further examine texts and explain their meaning.

"Some say emptiness is not, up to 'because not determined'": This is precisely *Yogācāra* twenty-eight's meaning. Therefore that text says: How are three liberation gates established? Namely, knowable objects briefly have two types: existent and non-existent. Conditioned and unconditioned are called existent; self, sentient beings, etc. are called non-existent. Within conditioned, seeing faults, therefore having nothing to pray for - depending on this, wishlessness liberation is established. Within unconditioned, seeing extreme tranquility, therefore deeply generating prayers - because within it [one] sees permanent departure - depending on this, signlessness liberation gate is established. Within that non-existent, non-possessing, neither having prayers nor lacking prayers - like that non-existence, accordingly thus knowing and seeing non-existence - depending on this, emptiness liberation gate is established.

Commentary: This text's meaning clarifies that wishlessness's object is precisely conditioned five aggregates, and signlessness's object is precisely unconditioned nirvana. Therefore these two gates accordingly contemplate truths. Emptiness gate's object is neither conditioned nor unconditioned - precisely imagined nature, therefore this gate only contemplates imagined [nature]. Speaking of "accordingly": signlessness gate's object has two approaches: First, permanent-impermanent approach - all permanent dharmas are perfectly realized nature, therefore taking cessation among four truths as object. Second, defiled-non-defiled approach - all non-defiled dharmas are all perfectly realized nature, therefore all taking path truth among four truths as object. To manifest this meaning, therefore it says "accordingly." Non-defiled dependent [nature] also applies to perfectly realized [nature]. Therefore it says "because two natures' essence is not determined." *Compilation* says:

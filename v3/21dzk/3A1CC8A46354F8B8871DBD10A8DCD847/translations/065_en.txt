[They] contemplate the noble path. If [they] do not contemplate, then [they] immediately lose [it]; if [they] contemplate, then [they] do not lose [it]. "Protector-dharma" [types] apply mental attention to protect, fearing loss of present dharma blissful abiding. If [they] wander scattered and negligent without protection, [they] immediately lose [it]; if [they] do not wander scattered, are not negligent, and protect [it], then [they] do not lose [it]. "Abiding non-movement" [types] - whether wandering scattered or not, whether having sustaining power or not - all do not retreat and lose present dharma blissful abiding, and also cannot transform dull faculties to become sharp. [This is] called "abiding non-movement." Speaking of "excellent progress" - whether scattered or not scattered, all do not retreat and lose present dharma blissful abiding, and necessarily can transform faculties to reach non-movement, hence called "necessarily excellent progress." Also called "capable of faculty transformation." Because [they] reach non-movement, [it] says "non-movement." Speaking of "non-movement" - having already achieved sharp faculties, whether scattered or not scattered, [they] finally do not retreat and lose present dharma blissful abiding. Ultimately not moved by afflictions, hence called "non-movement." Sharp faculties [have] only one [type]; dull faculties open into five. Hence [there are] six types. The reason for this is: sharp faculties have no distinctions, established as one type. That is, non-movement dharma - both cultivation-achieved and original nature have no distinction. Dull faculty natures have many meaningful distinctions, hence separately opened into five types. Neither progressing nor retreating establishes one type, called "abiding non-movement." Capable of attaining advancement and cultivating refined faculties establishes one type, called "capable of attaining." The one type of retreat-dharma has the most inferior nature, hence even when possessing all conditions, [they] definitely retreat. The one type of thought-dharma allows for non-retreat when thinking; not thinking then retreating. The one type of protector-dharma - even without thinking of harm, also does not retreat and lose [blissful abiding], but [only through] protection. If negligent then retreating; if not negligent then not harming retreat. Such six types completely include all arhat fruits. According to the Sarvāstivādins, among the six types, [they] divide non-movement dharma into two: originally non-movement [is] called

non-retreat; that achieved through faculty refinement [is] called non-movement. Hence among arhat fruits [they] establish seven natures. Extensively as in the *Abhidharmakośa*. Now saying "abiding non-movement" - "non-retreating ones," the fourth abiding dharma, although also called "abiding non-movement," now [we] do not take that [meaning], only concerning the sixth [it is] called "abiding non-movement." "Retreating nature ones, retreat-dharma etc." - this text is somewhat obscure. "Retreating nature ones" are retreat-dharma. Among these four natures - thought-dharma, protector-dharma, and necessarily excellent progress - there are two types. First is original nature, not achieved through faculty refinement, hence called "original nature." Second is accommodating nature, obtained only through faculty refinement, hence called "accommodating nature thought-dharma etc." Among the four, if [they are] original nature ones, [they] completely do not retreat. If retreat-dharma people refine faculties and progressively achieve thought-dharma etc., this is precisely retreating. To manifest this distinction, [it] says "original natures do not retreat; those who progress from retreat-dharma retreat." Extensively as explained in the *Prakaraṇārtha* etc.

"The Mahāsāṃghikas etc.... therefore retreat because [it is] not so": This school's intention explains: the first fruit only uses one seeing path without contamination to eliminate various afflictions, but has not yet combined cultivation. Also within that body, delusions are not yet exhausted, cultivated noble dharmas are still not perfected, attained noble paths are not yet firm, hence retreat is possible. The fourth fruit's principle is precisely contrary. How could there be retreat? Question: Do the second and third fruits have retreat or not? Explanation: Just like the first fruit, there are also those with retreat. This principle is not doubtful. Hence [it] briefly does not explain. Question: In the Sarvāstivādin school, the seeing path is swift and has no meaning of exiting contemplation. Does the Mahāsāṃghika school also permit this meaning? Explanation: In the Mahāsāṃghika school doctrine, within the seeing path stage, there is also exiting contemplation. Like Elder Sudatta, when at one time offering food to support monks,

in the sky there was a deva who spoke saying: "This is stream-entry direction, this is stream-entry fruit" up to extensive explanation. Having already permitted the initial direction to receive offered food, [it is] clearly known [that one] can also exit seeing path contemplation. Though knowing [that] with one mind [one] observes the principle of the four truths, elimination of delusions is not yet complete, [one] can also exit contemplation. Like first observing the principle of the four truths of the desire realm, eliminating desire realm delusions, and temporarily exiting contemplation to receive Sudatta's offerings, later entering to eliminate both upper [realms]. Hence stream-entry direction also abides for a long time. The *Mahāvibhāṣā* volume 131 also has this matter. However that text says "Elder Utkala offered food and meals to monks," not saying "Sudatta offered food and meals to monks." [One] should examine by consulting the treatise.

"Now Mahāyāna nobles... the Yogācāra is also thus": Within present Mahāyāna, what is eliminated by the noble path definitely does not retreat. Arousing worldly paths, what is suppressed has the meaning of returning to retreat. Hence the *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* fourth volume, Tathāgata Nature chapter says: "Ordinary beings, though eliminating afflictions, because [afflictions] arise again after elimination, [this is] called impermanent." Now pointing to that text, ordinary being wisdom [is] called "conventional path." "The Yogācāra is also thus" - the *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-one says: "Retreat has two types: first is elimination-retreat, second is abiding-retreat. Speaking of 'elimination-retreat' - this is only ordinary beings. Speaking of 'abiding-retreat' - this applies to both ordinary [beings] and nobles. If through worldly supernatural powers [one] eliminates various afflictions, [they] again arise to the fore" up to extensive explanation. Now pointing to that text, hence [it] says "the Yogācāra is also thus." Question: In Mahāyāna doctrine, if noble paths eliminate seeds, [they] definitely do not retreat - how should [we] reconcile the *Garbhāvakrānti Sūtra* text? Hence that sūtra's fifth volume, Conduct chapter says: "Some sentient beings approach pratyekabuddha[-hood], then fall back and drop to ordinary being ground. Some sentient beings approach arhat[-hood], then fall back and drop to ordinary being

ground" up to extensive explanation. "Some sentient beings approach stream-entry, then fall back and drop to ordinary being ground. Some sentient beings, at dharma ground, retreat and fall to ordinary being ground. Some sentient beings, at faith ground, retreat and fall to ordinary being ground" etc. Extensively as explained there. If [we] say that sūtra concerns retreating from present dharma blissful abiding, not retreating from fruit, why does [it] explain saying "falling to ordinary being ground"? Explanation: Because retreat characteristics resemble [those of] ordinary [beings], [it] says "falling to ordinary being ground." What does this meaning [entail]? Dull faculty ordinary beings, regarding various meditative concentration present dharma blissful abiding, precisely have retreat and loss. Temporarily liberated nobles' retreat and loss of blissful abiding has similar meaning. Hence [it] says "falling to ordinary [being ground]," not meaning retreating from fruit. This meaning is still difficult. Scholars should contemplate [it].

"Retreating etc. natures... because of conditioned suppression": "Retreating etc. natures are established depending on concentration obstacles" etc. - the retreating etc. six natures are all established depending on faculty obstacles, ignorance, and concentration obstacles. Hence [they] only retreat from meditative concentration present dharma blissful abiding, not retreating from noble fruits. Hence *Yogācārabhūmi* twenty-six says: "By what retreat/non-retreat distinctions are persons established? By retreat, [we] establish temporarily liberated arhats. They allow for retreat and loss regarding present dharma blissful abiding. By non-retreat, [we] establish non-movement dharma arhats. They definitely have no retreat and loss regarding present dharma blissful abiding. This is the distinction." Through this [it is] clearly known: only retreating from blissful abiding, not retreating from noble fruits.

Like Śāriputra... the sixth mind of the ten faiths still retreats etc.: According to the *Ten Faiths Eliminating Bonds Sūtra*, [someone] might progress from first abiding to fifth abiding, then later retreat and fall back to first abiding, later from first abiding reaching fifth and sixth abidings. Thus experiencing sixty kalpas, finally not reaching the ground of non-retreat. Śāri-

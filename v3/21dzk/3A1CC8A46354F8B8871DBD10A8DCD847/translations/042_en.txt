故に。Because it conditions suchness, it can eliminate delusions. According to the present chapter master's intention, it is simultaneous subsequent [wisdom]. Though it only conditions phenomena, because it is free from ignorance regarding principle, it also eliminates delusions. Since the treatise text already says "clearly manifests in established and non-established [truths]," we know it eliminates.

"From 'Also cognitive obstacles' to 'the latter interpretation is superior'": Among the previous two masters, this is the second master's doctrine. Because it is the Dharma-protection school, it says "the latter is superior." Within the Dharma-protection school, there are also two explanations. The first explanation can be understood: cognitive obstacles are eliminated only through fundamental wisdom; afflictive obstacles are eliminated through both wisdoms. Because this is the second doctrine, it says "also." Among cognitive obstacles, some are eliminated through subsequent [wisdom]. However, there are distinctions. If cognitive obstacles arise together with grasping, they are eliminated only by correct wisdom, because they necessarily involve delusion regarding principle. If they do not arise together with grasping, they are eliminated only by subsequent [wisdom]. Now saying "delusion regarding phenomena but not grasping" refers to what does not co-arise with grasping. Question: That there are [obstacles] in cognitive obstacles that are delusions regarding phenomena but not grasping can be understood based on the text. Are there perhaps [obstacles] in afflictive obstacles that are delusions regarding phenomena but not grasping? Explanation: This also exists. Excluding greed etc. that co-arise with self-view, the remaining independent greed etc. are only delusions regarding phenomena and are not co-arisen with grasping, so this doctrine is possible. It is rather difficult - students should contemplate this.

"From 'Therefore able to eliminate obstacles' to 'also able to subdue'": Generally discussing elimination and subduing, there are briefly three approaches. First, it applies to preparatory, fundamental, and subsequent [wisdom]. Second, the three-wisdom approach: only wisdom eliminates, not applying to hearing and contemplation. Third, the contaminated/uncontaminated approach: it applies to both contaminated and uncontaminated. This explains subduing and eliminating through the four paths in concentration. If subduing afflictions while in concentration, because it necessarily becomes the four paths, it is only cultivated wisdom. Scattered states are not thus - not necessarily the four paths. Otherwise, hearing and contemplation can also subdue, means

like in the desire realm, roughly gathering and restraining the mind to subdue afflictions etc. This is in hearing and contemplation, not the cultivated wisdom stage. Therefore it says "otherwise, hearing and contemplation can also eliminate and subdue."

"From 'The third eliminative nature' to 'there should be no liberation'": Regarding dependent nature, it takes suchness manifested by the two emptinesses as essence. If regarding conventional establishment, it takes the analytical cessation obtained by eliminating the two obstacles as essence. The three vehicles, according to what is appropriate, obtain this analytical cessation. If not taking the conventional but only taking suchness as eliminative nature, there should be no analytical cessation liberation in the learning fruits. The Compilation says: Investigating, the essence of eliminating obstacles is precisely analytical cessation. What is eliminated, what eliminates, and the manifested suchness are all fruits of elimination, not the essence itself. Therefore the Abhidharma text names the non-arising of afflictions as cessative nature. This explains the fruit of elimination and names it eliminating obstacles. If naming eliminating obstacles regarding the cause of elimination, precisely taking what eliminates as the essence of eliminating obstacles. What is eliminated and the nature are fruits of elimination. The present chapter master's intention is not thus. Generally discussing eliminative essence, there are two: First, real essence - taking suchness as essence. Second, conventional essence - taking analytical cessation as essence. According to what is appropriate, it applies to both. This is only regarding the fruit of elimination, establishing the essence of eliminating obstacles. One cannot rely on "taking non-arising of afflictions as cessative nature." Rather, relying on conventional essence to discuss cessative nature. Therefore there is no contradiction.

"From 'Third, depending on consciousness' to 'because of no contamination'": The Sarvāstivāda doctrine is as explained in Abhidharmakośa treatise fascicle 21. Therefore that verse says: View-eliminated [delusions], pride, drowsiness, and dominant subsidiary afflictions all arise only in the mental ground. The rest depend on the six consciousnesses. Extensively as explained there. That the Vatsiputriya school's eliminable [delusions] arise only in the sixth [consciousness] etc. means: This school says the five consciousnesses have no contamination and are also not apart from contamination. They only have neutral [states].

They completely lack good and evil. Because they are non-discriminative. Those with discrimination have good and evil. As in the *Sectarian Wheel Commentary*.

"From 'What the Mahāyāna eliminates' to 'grasping is precisely the distinction'": That cognitive obstacles exist in the remaining seven except the seventh - Master Sthiramati explains that the treatise only speaks of correspondence with those four afflictions because the three positions are absent. However, this obstacle essence has no broad or narrow [distinction] with dharma-grasping in essence. Because calculating that dharmas have essence and function are all grasping. That afflictive obstacles exist in the remaining consciousnesses except the eighth means: The eighth consciousness continuously turns with subtle behavioral characteristics, therefore has no afflictive obstacles. However, among the seven consciousnesses, the self-view arising from the sixth and seventh consciousnesses constitutes self-grasping. The mind and mental factors corresponding with that, because they condition one object, are called grasping by association. Independent greed etc., because they do not calculate self, though afflictive obstacles, are not self-grasping. "Grasping is precisely the distinction" has two explanations. First: Though grasping and obstacles have no broad/narrow [distinction], because the doctrine differs from Dharma-protection, it says "grasping is precisely the distinction." Second: The location of grasping and the location of obstacles have different doctrines. In the seventh consciousness there is only person-grasping. In the fifth and eighth consciousnesses there is only dharma-grasping. The sixth consciousness has both graspings. Because of such distinctions, it says "grasping is precisely the distinction."

"From 'Master Dharma-protection' to 'grasping is precisely the distinction'": That the two obstacles both apply to the first seven consciousnesses means excluding the eighth consciousness - the first seven consciousnesses. Master Dharma-protection's sectarian intention is that obstacles and grasping are two different things. That is, if it is grasping, it is necessarily an obstacle. There are naturally [things] that are obstacles but not grasping. Namely, excluding

wisdom, the remaining mental factors. As explained in treatise fascicle eight. "Grasping is precisely the distinction" also has two explanations. First: Grasping and obstacles have broad/narrow [distinctions], and because the doctrine differs from Sthiramati, it says "grasping is precisely the distinction." Second: The location of grasping and the location of obstacles have different doctrines. The seventh and sixth both have the two graspings. The fifth and eighth consciousnesses both lack the two graspings, therefore it says "grasping is precisely the distinction." Question: The fifth and eighth consciousnesses both lack the two graspings. Why do the five consciousnesses have obstacles while the eighth has no obstacles? Explanation: The five consciousnesses have inferior power and only gain obstacles by being led by the sixth. The eighth is not thus, therefore has no two obstacles. Therefore the *Three Wisdoms Meaning Forest* says: Though the five consciousnesses are non-discriminative, by being led and produced by the sixth consciousness's discrimination, they have discriminative delusions etc. Question: The sixth and seventh consciousnesses have person-grasping, so they should be able to give rise to afflictions. The five consciousnesses lack person-grasping - how can they give rise to afflictions? Explanation: Through the sixth [consciousness's] person-grasping leading to the production of delusions in the five consciousnesses, though lacking grasping they have afflictions. Question: If so, through the sixth [consciousness's] discrimination, it should be able to lead to the production of the two graspings in the five consciousnesses. Explanation: Generally, giving rise to grasping occurs through sharp wisdom deeply calculating the self, then it can arise naturally. In those five consciousnesses there is no sharp wisdom and also no calculative discrimination, therefore no two graspings.

"From 'Karma generated by obstacles' to 'not retribution fruits'": If karma generated by afflictive obstacles, [it is] sinful, meritorious, and immovable karma. If karma generated by cognitive obstacles, it is dharma-conditioned discriminative karma. These two karmas exist only in the first six [consciousnesses]. The remaining seventh and eighth consciousnesses are neutral. Though having mental factors of volition, they are inferior in conditioning internal [objects].

deeply gives rise to shame. (Above is treatise text) The previous master explains: Since the treatise text already says "when manifesting transgressions at other places, [one] deeply gives rise to shame," it is clearly known that what is prevented - the non-virtues - also extends to other bodies. Through this [one] should know: the doctrine that others' four great [elements] produce one's own non-manifest precepts also has no obstruction. However, formless concentration-path concurrent precepts only follow past prevented other non-virtues' great element production (meaning). Now refuting: "The doctrine that others' four great [elements] produce this is not so." Because [they are] not one's own transgressions; because [one] cannot prevent [them], [they] should not be antidotes. This completes the repeated refutation.

From "This doctrine is named form" to "great [elements] produce present form": "This doctrine is named form, provisionally called produced" - production has two meanings. If real intimate production, [it] must be same-nature production, not different natures; must be same-realm production, not different realms; concentration and dispersion must be the same. If provisional production, [it is] remote interdependent production, following appropriately without obstruction. Now based on remote explanation, hence saying "provisionally named produced." Regarding remote mutual relationship, explaining remote partial antidote. Therefore [there are] no various faults as previously explained - if what is prevented has long been extinguished, there should be no establishing cause, etc. "Remotely preventing one's own past evil precepts, etc." - Master Lin says: Past world dharmas can also give rise to precepts. If [one] slanders and falsifies past buddha-dharma, [one] completely binds those transgressions. Hence knowing: [one] prevents and stops past objects. Future is also thus; all have precept-prevention. Also Buddha told Tiwei to take refuge in future sangha. Hence knowing: giving rise to precepts - those already arisen and not-yet-arisen matters are all in preventive suspension. Taking those past former existences, future should-have arisings, not taking what the two times lack (etc.). Now the chapter compiler's meaning is also the same. Hence saying "remotely preventing one's own past evil precepts, etc." Only preventing one's own body, not preventing other bodies. Hence differing from the previous

master. Question: If so, with firm intention desiring to kill all sentient beings, [one] completely binds those transgressions. Using this to test conversely, how can [one] not prevent other non-virtues? Answer: Mental dharmas have no location, their function pervades self and others. Though function pervades others, [it] returns to being one's own mind. Hence though desiring to kill all sentient beings, only in one's own mind [one] binds many transgressions. Hence no obstruction.

From "Or non-manifest precepts" to "because of complete establishing causes": This is the third explanation, precisely the chapter compiler's additional interpretation. Hence Master Ji's *Yogācārabhūmi* commentary volume two says: The five causes of arising, etc., are all contained in predominant [causation]. Either possessing five meanings or not possessing five - [one] need not necessarily possess [them]. Also says: Various sunlight, traveling fragrances, etc., because they are separated from great elements; concentration-path precept forms born in the formless realm have no four great [elements] (above is commentary text). Explaining: "Either possessing five" - the meaning concerns co-substantial production: only same-aggregate production, not different aggregates; only real production, not provisional. "Either not possessing five" concerns separated-substantial production: because power depends on those existences, [one] can remotely produce non-manifest precepts, etc. Having no co-substantial production meaning, hence not possessing establishing causes.

From "If taking dependent body" to "prevented great element production": This is precisely the chapter compiler refuting the previous first master's doctrine. "Then not Mahayana" - if following Mahayana, the formless [realm] also has meditative discipline, because *Yogācārabhūmi* 82 says: "In desire realm activities there are individual liberation disciplines; in form and formless realm activities, there are meditative disciplines." Also *Prakaraṇāryavāca* 13's meditative moral conduct - saying "equipoise" refers to formless concentration. If following Hinayana Sarvāstivāda, meditative discipline exists only in the form realm, not extending to the formless. If like the previous master, taking dependent body great [elements] to be named production, formless realm saints, having no

dependent body, should have no non-manifest [precepts]. If making this interpretation, [it] would be the same as Sarvāstivāda doctrine. Hence saying "then not Mahayana." Also contradicting *Prakaraṇāryavāca*, etc. - this is precisely *Prakaraṇāryavāca* volume one text. "Non-manifesting dharmas" refers to what is prevented - non-virtues. Depending on precept-maintaining power, those non-virtues do not arise. Hence saying "non-manifesting dharmas." If individual liberation precepts, through intention-seed power preventing non-virtues, non-virtuous body-speech then do not manifest. Regarding that non-manifestation, provisionally establish non-manifest [precepts]. If concentration-path precepts, regarding concentration-path associated intention, the meaning of prevented body-speech non-manifestation, provisionally establish non-manifest [precepts]. Therefore generally saying "various disciplinary forms depend on non-manifesting dharmas to establish form-nature."

From "Sustaining causes are precisely" to "should have interruption": In this text, from "sustaining causes" below to "causing non-cessation" is precisely *Abhidharmasamuccaya* treatise text. From "derived matter continuous arising" below to "should have interruption" is precisely the chapter compiler's explanatory text. Saying "sustaining causes are sustaining causes" also has two interpretations. First, taking sustaining meaning to briefly explain the name "sustaining." Second, precisely using *Yogācārabhūmi* treatise's sustaining causes to correspond and match with *Mahāyāna-abhidharmasamuccaya*'s possessed sustaining causes. Saying "sustaining" concerns sustaining results causing dwelling, thereby gaining the cause name. Hence named "sustaining causes."

From "*Yogācārabhūmi* volume three" to "equal measure indestructible": In the reconciling contradictions below, first presenting contradictory objections, then from "The *Abhidharmasamuccaya* depends on complete aspects" below, correctly addressing contradictory objections. This is precisely the beginning. In presenting contradictory objections, first citing *Yogācārabhūmi* text to challenge *Abhidharmasamuccaya*'s meaning, then raising actual matters to challenge *Yogācārabhūmi*'s meaning. Above, the chapter compiler explained *Abhidharmasamuccaya*'s meaning, saying derived matter's continuous arising depends on great [elements'] sustaining power; otherwise derived matter should have interruption. Precisely *Abhidharmasamuccaya*'s meaning concerns producing all forms - separated-substantial and co-substantial - to explain sustaining causes. Hence citing *Yogācārabhūmi* text to make the objection

saying: If already so, why does *Yogācārabhūmi* volume three say "because of following great elements' equal measure indestructibility, [it is] named sustaining cause"? Precisely *Yogācārabhūmi*'s meaning depends only on co-substantial derived matter to explain sustaining causes. Hence making this objection. How can [one] know? Master Ji's *Abhidharmasamuccaya* commentary volume one says: "Derived matter's continuous arising depends on great [elements'] sustaining power; otherwise derived matter would immediately be interrupted. If already so, *Yogācārabhūmi* volume three explains: because of following great elements' equal measure indestructibility, [it is] named dwelling-sustaining, etc." Already saying "if already so," then citing *Yogācārabhūmi* text, clearly knowing volume three text is precisely cited as objection. Also "sounds, light, etc. having different sizes" - later raising actual matters to challenge *Yogācārabhūmi* text, saying: Presently seeing sounds and light having different sizes, how can [one] only explain equal measure indestructibility? This objection's meaning: connecting to substance to emit sound, sound is then larger than substance. Also the solar disk measures fifty-one yojanas; light separated from disk substance pervades within one continent. Co-substantial four great [elements] and produced sounds and light have different measures. How can [one] only explain equal measure indestructibility? This completes presenting contradictory objections.

From "*Abhidharmasamuccaya* depends on complete [aspects]" to "explaining derived matter" - In correctly addressing objections there are two explanations. This is the first explanation. Production has two kinds: First, intimate proximate production - like five objects attached to substance all being equal to substance measure, hence named "equal measure indestructible." This is co-substantial production meaning. Second, remote distant production - like sounds, fragrances, etc. being separated from substance and remote; having departed, all are larger than substance. This is separated-substantial production meaning. *Abhidharmasamuccaya* treatise, regarding two kinds of production, explains sustaining cause meaning, hence saying "depending on complete aspects." *Yogācārabhūmi* treatise, regarding one kind of co-substantial production, explains sustaining cause meaning, hence saying "depending on partial aspects." Because what is regarded is not the same, [there is] no

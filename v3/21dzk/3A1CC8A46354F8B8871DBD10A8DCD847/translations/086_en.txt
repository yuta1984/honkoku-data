Resistant derived matters and mind-following non-manifest matters, regardless of which world they are in, are created by the great elements of that world. That is, past creates past, present creates present, future creates future. The creation time of various non-manifest matters is not like this. [Above is treatise text] As extensively explained there. Now in Mahāyāna, if same-world creation, it is only about the present world; if different-world creation, past creates present, present creates future. Only depending on this measure, different-world creation is explained. Now distinguishing Hīnayāna to manifest Mahāyāna meaning, hence saying "should only be as explained here." Past being present cause etc. - correctly manifesting Mahāyāna's different-world creation meaning. In Hīnayāna schools, past becomes cause for three worlds, but only past being present cause has meaning identical to Mahāyāna. Now distinguishing past being cause for past and future, hence saying "not past-future cause." The reason this can be known: *Vibhāṣā* says: "Are there past great elements creating past matters? Answer: Yes. All past resistant derived matters etc. are only created by past great elements. Are there past great elements creating future matters? Answer: Yes. Future non-manifest [matters] are only created by past great elements." [Above is treatise text] Future not being future cause etc. - Hīnayāna says future becomes future cause; now immediately distinguishing that, hence saying "future not future cause." Hence *Vibhāṣā* says: "Are there future great elements creating future matters? Answer: Yes. All future resistant derived matters etc. are only created by future great elements." [Above is treatise text] Question: If past and future are already non-existent, how can past be present cause and present be future cause? How can bodiless future await causes to arise? Explanation: Speaking of suspended creation regarding what was and will be, hence no obstruction.

From "this does not explain" to "analogous causes and effects": Not explaining past being future cause etc. - if following Hīnayāna, also explains past being future cause. Hence *Vibhāṣā* says: "Are there past great elements creating future matters? Answer: Yes. There are future manifest-originated non-manifest [matters], only created by past great elements." [Above is treatise text] Now distinguishing their calculation, hence saying "not explaining past being future cause." Also later periods not being causes for earlier periods etc. - *Vibhāṣā* says: "Are there future great elements creating past-present matters? Answer: No. There is no principle of results first, causes later." [Above is treatise text] Inverting cause and effect is what both Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna prevent. However, in Mahāyāna, though causes and effects are simultaneous, when results are not yet produced, causes are first and results later. These principles are common to both Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna. Hence saying "later periods not being causes for earlier periods etc." In the above cause-creation [section], Master Fan uses arising-understanding two causes etc., seven categories of various causes to explain the door of various causes' mutual inclusion. Fearing prolixity, temporarily stopping. Extensively as explained in that master's *Abhidharma* commentary volume one.

From "having distinguished cause-creation" to "no remaining two conditions": Great-derived mutually facing become one superior [condition] - greats facing derived matters, derived [matters] facing great elements, among the four conditions, only become one superior condition. Why no causal condition? Productive and produced are both manifest dharmas, only arising from their respective seeds in the foundational consciousness, then becoming causal conditions, intimately distinguishing essence, correctly producing results. Manifest [dharmas] mutually facing do not distinguish essence, hence not causal conditions. However, regarding this great-derived mutual facing becoming conditions, *Vibhāṣā* has two explanations. Hence that treatise one hundred thirty-one says: "Great [elements] are how many conditions for derived matters? Answer: Cause and superior. Cause means arising etc. five causes. Superior means not obstructing arising etc. Some say great elements become similar-type causes for derived tactile [qualities]." Also "Derived matters are how many conditions for great elements? Answer: Cause and superior. Cause means one retribution cause. Superior means not obstructing arising etc. Some say derived [matters] and tactile [qualities] become similar-type causes for various great elements." That treatise immediately refutes the second master saying: "This is not reasonable. Derived, tactile [qualities] and great elements are not similar types." [Above is treatise text] Present Mahāyāna intention accords with the first master's meaning. Hence saying "great-derived mutually facing become one superior." Arising etc. five causes are superior conditions. Immediate-sequence conditions and object-conditions only exist in mind etc. Great elements and derived matters are not mind etc. Hence lacking the remaining two.

[Content continues from previous section about causes and conditions...]

From "this cause-condition creation" to "all reasonably contemplate": This cause-condition creation - causes are ten causes and six causes. Conditions are the four conditions of causal conditions etc. The above-explained cause-creation and condition-creation depend on general characteristics. Other specific characteristic doors show abbreviation due to prolixity. Depending on conditioned-unconditioned and twelve sense-fields etc. - immediately showing abbreviation. Briefly indicating four doors to distinguish the abundance of causes and conditions. First, conditioned-unconditioned door. Great-derived both extend to conditioned-unconditioned. Second, three-category distinction door. Though great elements and derived matters extend to three categories, in the twelve sense-fields their functions are most manifest. Hence specifically raising them. Among twelve sense-fields, great elements exist only in tactile-field and dharma-field. Derived matters extend to eleven fields, only excluding mind-field. Third, three-nature distinction door. Unconditioned great-derived are all only wholesome. Conditioned great elements are only neutral-natured. Derived matters - real ones are only neutral-natured, provisional ones extend to three natures. Fourth, three-realm distinction door. Great elements and derived matters exist only in desire-form [realms], not formless realm. Speaking of nine grounds, bound by five grounds: desire realm and four meditations. Therefore when separating from fourth meditation's defilements, then ultimately severed. As explained in *Vibhāṣā* one hundred twenty-nine. Saying "mutually facing each other etc." - among twelve sense-fields, if following derived [matters] to discuss productive greats, there are eleven total: eye-field dependent great elements up to dharma-field, only excluding mind-field since it's not derived. Eye-field great elements, facing eye-field greats, become two causes one condition. "Two causes" means simultaneous causes and similar-type causes. Co-arising mutually facing become simultaneous causes; prior arising becomes similar-type cause for later arising. "One condition" means superior condition - not obstructing arising and only non-obstruction. If eye-field greats face other-field greats, only one superior. Should be known as before. Up to dharma-field great elements facing dharma-field greats become cause-superior. Facing other great elements, only one superior. Should be known as before. Like eye-field greats facing eye-field greats, and ear etc. greats distinguishing cause-condition abundance likewise. Other-field great elements facing other-field greats are all likewise. This uses greats facing greats to distinguish cause-conditions. Derived [matters] facing derived [matters] become three causes one condition. "Three causes" means simultaneous, similar-type, retribution three causes. "One condition" means superior condition. Among twelve sense-fields, mutually facing explanations should be reasonably contemplated following the above. Like twelve sense-fields mutually facing explanations, three-nature three-realm mutually facing explanations should be known following this. These meaning-doors are as extremely detailed and extensively explained in *Vibhāṣā* one hundred thirty-one. Fearing textual prolixity, temporarily showing one corner. However, in Mahāyāna, not yet seeing such texts. Principle must be thus. Hence saying "all reasonably contemplate."

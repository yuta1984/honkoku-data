Emptiness eternally transcends the eight sufferings, therefore it is explained as ultimate truth.

"Question: This school... only has such differences": This removes doubt through question and answer. The meaning of the question is: What is the difference between the two truths distinguished by this characteristic-negating school and the previous nature-negating two truths? "Ancient explanations say, etc." refers to Master Yuan's explanation. "Conditional provisional existence" refers to the principle-characteristic conventional truth within the nature-negating school. Namely, worldly dharmas' falseness, conditionality, and collective functions being truly so is called conventional truth. "Delusional existence" is the delusional conventional truth within the characteristic-negating school. This refers to the principles of worldly dharmas, which are all delusional existence, like mirage water, therefore called conventional truth. "Emptiness of naturelessness" refers to the nature-negating school's emptiness of naturelessness within causal combination and emptiness of naturelessness within dharma combination as ultimate truth. "Emptiness of characteristiclessness" means taking ultimate delusional imagination's empty quiescence as ultimate truth.

"Next, regarding the fourth... called the first": This fourth section below marks the doctrine of the reality-revealing school and corresponds to the sūtra text. Master Yuan says: Within the fourth school, conventional truth has two aspects: first existence, second non-existence. Within existence there are six types. First is phenomenal existence - referring to aggregates, elements, etc. This is the same as the first school's conventional truth phenomena. Up to the sixth is true existence - referring to the Tathāgata-garbha. What is called non-existence follows meanings and has four types. First is the absence of self and person in the aggregates. This is the same as the first school's ultimate truth principle. Up to the fourth is delusional non-existence, which is not the same as previous schools. Within ultimate truth, there are distinctly two meanings: first existence, second non-existence. Existence refers to the Tathāgata-garbha nature's countless buddha-dharmas. Within non-existence there are five types. First is true reality. The countless buddha-dharmas within the Tathāgata-garbha are collectively conditioned as one essence, with no single dharma separately maintaining self-nature, which is called

non-existence. Up to the fifth: within this truth there is no delusional emptiness of Tathāgata-garbha. These five generally regarding the Tathāgata-garbha essence within ultimate meaning, distinguished according to meanings, are all ultimate truth. The sūtra says: "Furthermore, good son, like one person having many abilities. When running, he is called a runner. Up to: depending on father and mother's combination for birth is called conventional truth; what is born from the combination of twelve-link dependent origination is called ultimate truth." The explanation says: The aspect of birth through father and mother is phenomenal dependent origination, which is conventional truth. The aspect of birth through dependent origination is dharma-nature dependent origination, which is ultimate truth.

"Ancient explanations say... therefore called the first": "Initial phenomenal conditionality" is also called phenomenal existence - referring to aggregates, elements, entrances, etc. This is the same as the initial conventional truth phenomena, therefore saying "as the Abhidharma explains." "Second dharma conditionality" is also called dharma-characteristic existence - namely suffering, impermanence, etc. This is the same as the first school's ultimate truth dharma. "Third provisional conditionality" is also called provisional name existence. This approach is the same as the conventional truth principle within the previous second school, therefore saying "as the Satyasiddhi explains." "Fourth delusional conditionality" is also called delusional existence. This approach is the same as the conventional truth principle within the previous third school. "Fifth delusional conditionality" is also called delusional existence. This clarifies that outside mind there is ultimately no nature, being only what deluded mind's false appearances see, therefore saying "like what is seen in dreams." "Sixth is true conditionality" is also called true existence - referring to Tathāgata-garbha dependent origination, which collectively forms saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. These latter two approaches are not the same as previous schools. Only one Tathāgata-garbha, following conditions, becomes buddha-nature and also becomes dependent origination. Buddha-nature and dependent origination are neither one nor different, therefore saying "like water arising from that."

"Though the above explanation is precise... the existing two truths": Below this, the chapter author personally states the correct doctrine. First refuting ancient explanations, then presenting current interpretation. This is the beginning. The commentary says: "The various Hīnayāna theories differ into twenty schools. How could Buddha have specifically explained two truths only for Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna schools? Though this reasoning is acceptable, it doesn't accord with the chapter author's intention of refuting the ancients. The chapter author's current intention is that various Hīnayāna theories differ into twenty schools. How could Buddha have specifically for future Tang China's needs had Master Yuan and others not explain other schools' two truths doctrines, but only separately explain the two truths of the two Hīnayāna schools of Sarvāstivāda and Satyasiddhi treatise? Such reasoning has no basis. Therefore one cannot say 'among the sūtra's seven rounds, the first three are the two truths distinguished within the nature-establishment school, the next two are the two truths distinguished within the nature-negating school.'"

"Therefore one should say... established in mutual opposition": This subsequently presents current interpretation. Master Yuan says: "Within the Nirvāṇa Sūtra, there are completely eight rounds explaining two truths. The first round clarifies two truths regarding persons, the latter seven rounds clarify two truths regarding dharmas." The chapter author's current intention is: among the latter seven rounds, the first round raises phenomena to explain the previous intention of establishing two truths based on persons; the latter six rounds are established in mutual opposition based on dharmas' superiority and inferiority. This explains dharma two truths. "The sūtra says: ordinary beings... called ultimate meaning": This cites text as proof. Among the latter seven rounds, explaining the first round's sūtra text. Since it already says "what ordinary beings know is called conventional truth, what sages know is called ultimate meaning," therefore we know this merely re-emphasizes previous meanings to make known that two truths are also established through mutual opposition based on persons. One cannot say "the first round corresponds to dharmas in distinguishing characteristics," which would contradict the sūtra's intention,

therefore.

"Though not clearly distinct... characteristics can be known": Below this addresses underlying objections to state correct doctrine. Question: "Among the latter seven rounds, if the first round raises phenomena to re-explain previous intention, the meaning can be understood. But why does the sūtra also explain the latter six rounds? What do they explain?" Therefore now generally responding: "Though not clearly differentiating and distinguishing, reasoning through meanings, this is precisely the four levels within this." "Explanations in Xianzang, etc." - Xianzang sixth says: "Worldly convention refers to establishing fields, houses, jars, bowls, armies, forests, numbers, etc., and establishing self, sentient beings, etc." Now briefly indicating one example, therefore saying "like self, sentient beings, etc." "Having name and reality called ultimate meaning, etc." - there are two explanations. First: the four types of ultimate meaning are generally called "having name and reality" because they all have name and essence. Second: only the three categories of dharmas are called "having name and reality" in contrast to self, etc. This can be understood from the text. "The treatise's explained four types of ultimate meaning" refers to Vijñāpti-mātra treatise ninth fascicle text. Namely in that treatise, it extensively explains the four truths.

"In the third round... all can be comprehensively formed": These two categories are: the category of self and sentient beings, and the category of aggregates, elements, and entrances. Question: "If self up to spinning fire wheels only have names without essence and function, why does the previous text say 'sentient beings, etc. lack function, fire wheels, etc. lack essence'? Since it says 'fire wheels lack essence' but doesn't say 'lack function,' why?" Explanation: If speaking of illuminating function, fire wheels also temporarily exist. If speaking of wheel function, only because they are not real do they lack function. Now saying "lack essence and function" means regarding

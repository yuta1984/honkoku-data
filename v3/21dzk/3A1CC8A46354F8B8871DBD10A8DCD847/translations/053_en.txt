"Now it is not so, up to 'because coarse and subtle differ'": The various masters of old, though each establishing different explanations, have not distinguished view-afflictions, cultivation-afflictions, and various consciousnesses. Therefore the doctrine is also incomplete. Hence [it] says "now it is not so." "Among the seven consciousnesses there are afflictive obstacles," etc.: Below [the text] explains the correct doctrine. Now [it] explains the principle of eliminating obstacles in the cultivation path. That afflictions arising from confusion about objects have many kinds of categories follows the coarseness and subtlety of objects, and afflictions are likewise. Within this, first [discussing] categories of obstacles, and later from "one should distinguish" onward, [it] clarifies the gradual or sudden [nature] of elimination. Within the former, first correctly determining grade numbers, and later from "the six innate afflictions' elimination is not the same" onward, extensively determining obstacles' grade numbers and briefly revealing elimination's gradual or sudden [nature]. This is the beginning. "Constituting eighty-one" clarifies cultivation-afflictions' grade numbers. "Because coarse and subtle differ" reveals view-afflictions' grade numbers. Coarse and subtle have two [types]: first, coarse and subtle of categories, explained according to nine grades; second, coarse and subtle of difficulty and ease, explained according to three minds. If according to categories, what is eliminated first is considered coarse. If according to difficulty and ease, what is eliminated first is named subtle. This has three sentences: some are difficult to eliminate yet not called subtle - namely the second and third grades among three minds; some are called subtle yet not difficult to eliminate - namely the first and middle grades among three minds; some are called subtle and also difficult to eliminate, like the lowest-lowest grade among nine grades. Also, by what counteracts and what is counteracted, [one] divides coarse and subtle. Among nine grades, following the characteristics of what is counteracted, each is called subtle. Among three minds, following the characteristics of what counteracts, [they are] called subtle. The ten afflictions of the seeing path, according to their correspondence, have two [types of] coarse and subtle. Therefore there are nine grades.

"The six innate afflictions, up to 'each ground [has] nine'": This later extensively determines obstacles' grade numbers and briefly reveals elimination's gradual or sudden [nature]. "Six innate afflictions," etc.: Among ten afflictions, view-afflictions have ten; cultivation-

afflictions only six - the remaining six afflictions excluding doubt and the latter three views. Hence [it] says "six innate afflictions." Though these six innate [afflictions] differ in elimination, namely self-view, extreme views, and corresponding pride and other afflictions are eliminated only at the ninth [grade]. Other independently arising greed, pride, ignorance, etc., are eliminated according to grade distinctions. However, their categories are also fixed, each [having] nine. Combining view and cultivation [afflictions], among ten afflictions, hatred [exists in] only one ground's nine; the remaining [exist in] nine grounds each [with] nine, totaling eighty-one grades.

Question: By what can [one] know that apart from self-view, there exist independent greed, etc.?
Answer: *Commentary* fascicle eight quotes *Dependent Origination Sutra* volume one saying: If dharmas are desire realm's defiled-neutral and have no superior function in generating various formations. Using this text as proof, apart from dharmas arising together with self-view, there also exist independent love, etc. that are neutral, namely [those] objectifying future existence, arising love and moistening birth, love, etc. Also *Commentary* fascicle ten says: Discriminative self-view, etc. within the sixth consciousness are called superior grade; independent greed, etc. within the sixth consciousness are called middle grade, because [they] extend to unwholesome. Through these two texts, [we] know independent greed, etc. extend to both unwholesome and neutral natures.

"Within the seventh consciousness, up to 'its own category has nine'": *Commentary* fascicle five explains these two doctrines. This first teacher's intention: the seventh [consciousness's] defiled dharmas, when the three realms are compared, though having nine grades, because [they] are the lowest grade in each ground, [they] are included in the ninth grade. The reason for this: this seventh [consciousness's] afflictions have no nine grades within their own ground, [and] resemble the ninth grade self-view within the six consciousnesses of their own ground. At vajra-mind, together with non-conceptual [realm's] ninth grade, [they are] suddenly

eliminated simultaneously. Therefore, within their own ground's nine grades, each is included in the ninth. This ninth grade's own category also [has] nine. Even up to non-conceptual [realm] should be known likewise. Hence [it] says "nine grounds are only the same as non-conceptual [realm's] ninth grade category."

Question: Sentient beings' seventh [consciousness], up to reaching non-defiled stages, has increases and decreases, therefore should be capable of perfuming. Non-sentient beings' seventh [consciousness] ultimately has no time of fluctuation. Since [it] lacks the third meaning of having increases and decreases, [it] should not be capable of perfuming.

Answer: This has two explanations. First: From beginningless [time], characteristics turn dark, moment by moment, manifestation and seeds increase. Like non-discriminative wisdom entering sagehood gradually becoming more luminous. However, [it is] extremely difficult. The reason for difficulty in understanding: sage wisdom gradually increases, ultimately reaching Buddha[hood] and becoming complete. Non-sentient beings' seventh [consciousness], exhausting future eons, what grade should [it] achieve? Second: When born in upper and lower [realms], ground-binding's coarseness and subtlety have increases and decreases, therefore [it] can perfume. Also there are separate explanations, as explained in *Commentary* fascicle five.

"Like supreme wrong [views], up to 'therefore constituting capable of perfuming'": This raises an analogy for explanatory confirmation. Just as root-severing wrong views, though only ninth grade, create nine grades and can sever good roots, this seventh [consciousness] afflictions should be known likewise. Because within one grade [it] divides into nine grades.

Question: By what can [one] know that root-severing wrong views are ninth grade yet also create nine grades to sever good roots?

Answer: *Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā* fascicle thirty-five explains: Among four types of nine grades, what is called "counteracting nine grades" means lowest-lowest grade brightness treats highest-highest grade ignorance, up to highest-highest grade brightness treats lowest-lowest grade ignorance. "Root-severing nine grades" means lowest-lowest grade wrong views sever highest-highest grade goodness, up to highest-

【Lower Section】
highest grade wrong views sever lowest-lowest grade goodness. If following the "root-severing nine grades" explanation, those wrong views have nine grades. If following the "counteracting nine grades" explanation, those wrong views are only one grade, because [they] counteract nine grades. *Abhidharmakośa* fascicle seventeen also explains similarly: Root-severing wrong views are included in the lowest-lowest grade among counteracting nine grades' treatments, therefore only ninth grade, yet creating nine grades, [they] can sever good roots.

Question: Speaking of "severing good," does [it] sever manifestations or sever seeds?

Answer: Due to the power of wrong views that slander cause and effect, [they] obstruct the manifestations produced by those naturally-arising good seeds, causing [them] not to continue. [This is] called severing good roots. Therefore [they] only sever manifestations, not severing seeds. This meaning of severing good is as explained in *Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā* fascicle thirty-five, *Abhidharmakośa* fascicle seventeen, *Yogācārabhūmi*, etc.

"Another position: nine grounds, up to 'grade numbers eliminated'": Within *Compilation* [this] explains this teacher's intention: Within nine grounds, each has nine grades. If finely divided, [they] would constitute eighty-one grades. Why not say each of nine grounds has nine grades, but say each has one grade?

Answer: Though having nine grades, because grade numbers are the same, and because coarseness and subtlety are the same as highest ground's lowest-lowest grade afflictions, [it] says "each has one grade." In principle, [one] should say each has nine grades. These eighty-one grades of afflictions, because their power each equals non-conceptual [realm's] lowest-lowest grade afflictions, [they are] suddenly eliminated simultaneously at vajra-mind.

However, regarding these two explanations, *Commentary* fascicle five judges saying "the former explanation is superior." In this present chapter, [it] does not judge which is superior.

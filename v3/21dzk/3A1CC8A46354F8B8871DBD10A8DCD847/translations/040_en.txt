It appears to eliminate karmas and results separately obtaining conditioned cessation. Now this is not the case. Previously during the with-remainder stage, one has already obtained the conditioned cessation of the essence of without-remainder. Now when entering without-remainder, the existing karmas and results ultimately become non-arising and obtain unconditioned cessation. It is not obtaining the extinction of those things and separately obtaining conditioned cessation. Now saying "nirvana without remainder is already conditioned cessation" is speaking by association. Taking afflictions as cause and karmas-results as effect. The effect follows the cause, thus explained as conditioned cessation. This text is somewhat profound. Students should contemplate it.

"From 'Saṃdhinirmocana' to 'all are also what is eliminated'": These are the next two texts. They prove that karmas and results generated by cognitive obstacles are all what is eliminated. "Various karma-destiny ignorance" displays the mistaken transgressions of the three actions it generates. Because they are not singular, it says "various." Ximming's explanation says: "Destiny" is the meaning of proceeding toward created matters. Cien's commentary says: This karma can obstruct the pure precepts of the second ground. Therefore it is called "destiny." Taking disparagement as the name. Like calling humans "evil destinies." One should not say "taking destiny to name as destiny." Because it does not take evil results. Being a category of ignorance. "Mistaken transgressions of three actions" means that first-ground bodhisattvas, though having no transgressions of natural prohibitions, regarding interdicted prohibitions, unconsciously have transgressions. Therefore the *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* says: "Because of extremely distant separation from the defilement of transgressing precepts." Vasubandhu's commentary says: "Natural precepts are accomplished. Not like the discriminating protective precepts of the first ground." The *Pivotal Essentials* below says: "Second-ground bodhisattvas, when walking, insects naturally divide the path, effortlessly not harming them. Therefore there are no mistaken transgressions. The first ground is not thus. Still has mistaken transgressions." Question: Treatise

fascicle eight says: "Those cognitive obstacles also cannot generate karma." Explaining: Commentary fascicle ten says: "If cognitive obstacles that generate karma and attract birth-and-death, they also cannot. Because they are not dharmas of bondage. In the previous fascicle eight, by this it explained non-generation. If the three actions that obstruct wisdom, even if not attracting evil results, these can also generate. What this text clarifies are only resultant and predominant karmas and results." Question: Dharma-grasping already applies to unwholesome. Why is it not bondage? Explaining: Not because unwholesome nature is bondage itself. Like mind-kings etc., whose nature is not bondage. Dharma-grasping only because it is associated with afflictions, therefore causes it to become unwholesome. Its nature is not bondage. Question: If so, why does it not induce retribution? Explaining: Though associated with unwholesome mind, it is still called morally neutral. Bodhisattvas and two-vehicle practitioners have different perspectives. Since it applies to both obscured and unobscured neutral states, it cannot attract retribution results.

"From 'In the Buddhabhūmi treatise' to 'both are what is eliminated'": In the text below, this is the sixth passage. It proves that dharmas like karmas and results of the two obstacles are all what is eliminated. Within afflictive obstacles, there are karmas and results. Sinful, meritorious, and immobile karmas are called "generated karmas." The coarse-characteristic results of segmented birth-and-death are called "obtained results." Within cognitive obstacles also, there are karmas and results. Various discriminative pure undefiled wholesome karmas are called "generated karmas." The fine-characteristic results of transformational birth-and-death are called "obtained results." Such karmas and results, using the root to include the branches, are all included within. Therefore it says "all are included in the two obstacles."

"From 'The essence of what eliminates obstacles' to 'gradually and suddenly subduing them'": Above explained what is eliminated. Below explains what eliminates. Subduing the power of seeds, not allowing them to manifest, therefore called "path capable of subduing." This applies to both contaminated

and uncontaminated, etc. Mahāyāna master Ji says: "Contaminated path means the six practices, etc. Uncontaminated path means, for instance, through the power of the third ground's non-discriminating wisdom eliminating cognitive obstacles associated with attachment to samādhi-dharmas, causing afflictions also not to manifest, this is called subduing afflictive obstacles. It is not separately arousing a path called subduing afflictions. Cognitive obstacles can be understood similarly. Also like separating from desires of the third dhyāna, subduing delusions of the fourth concentration and above, entering cessation concentration."

This means using subsequent wisdom to subdue the two obstacles. Ximming's explanation says: "Contaminated subduing paths have two meanings. First, learning the six-practice observation, subduing delusions eliminated by cultivation in lower realms, not allowing them to manifest. Second, learning the two-emptiness observation, generally subduing the two obstacles, not allowing them to manifest. This treatise's intention takes the latter, not the former, explaining subduing and eliminating the ten grounds' obstacles. This applies from pre-grounds through the seventh ground. If uncontaminated subduing paths, they generally include the four of preparatory, uninterrupted, etc. Regarding what they themselves eliminate, they are called eliminating paths. Regarding obstacles of other categories, they are subduing paths. Because what they face differs. With this meaning, therefore it says 'this applies to both contaminated and uncontaminated paths, preparatory and other three wisdoms.' 'According to their correspondence, gradually and suddenly subduing them'" means if preparatory paths can gradually subdue, fundamental and subsequent wisdoms suddenly subdue. Or fundamental and subsequent can also gradually subdue. There are none among preparatory paths that can suddenly subdue. Question: Do preparatory wisdoms apply to uncontaminated? Explaining: They do not apply. From the eighth ground upward there are no preparatory wisdoms. Also no contaminated minds. Question: If so, why does *Abhidharmasamuccaya* fascicle ten say: "Diamond mind has two. First, included in preparatory path. Second, included in uninterrupted path." Explaining: There is no contradiction. Using uncontaminated mind, effortlessly entering fundamental wisdom, therefore explained and called preparatory path. Not preparatory wisdom. Preparatory wisdom has seeking toward that. This is just the previous

preparatory path, not seeking, therefore. Preparatory wisdom does not apply to uncontaminated. Or there are two explanations. As in commentary fascicle ten.

"From 'This displays preparatory' to 'not hearing-contemplating wisdom'": That preparatory wisdom can gradually subdue and the other two wisdoms can suddenly subdue - in sudden and gradual subduing, the commentary states two explanations. One says: Preparatory gradually subdues. Correct wisdom and subsequent [wisdom] suddenly subdue. One says: Fundamental and subsequent generally can gradually subdue. There are none among preparatory paths that can suddenly subdue. In this present text, it provisionally presents the first explanation. Question: If preparatory wisdom only gradually subdues and has no sudden subduing, then the supreme worldly dharma position subduing discriminative delusions - this is sudden subduing. How can it now say "only gradual with no sudden"? Explaining: From previous gradual subduing, when reaching the final position, it is then called sudden subduing, but it is not now reaching that point and additionally arousing separate wisdom to suddenly subdue those delusions. Therefore there is no contradiction. "Through this power, etc." means through the three wisdoms causing present non-arising, calling this subduing. Not necessarily the six practices - this displays that the six practices of rejoicing in higher and being disgusted with lower, separately creating preparatory practices, are then called subduing. This meaning generally displays that there are two types of subduing. First, power subduing. Second, preparatory subduing. Direct realization is only power subduing. Not preparatory subduing. When the path simply arises, being contrary to that, naturally not arising, this is called subduing. The six-practice observation, etc., is preparatory subduing. Arousing separate intention, subduing those delusions. If the expedient six practices approaching the noble path are distinctions of preparatory wisdom's behavioral characteristics, not separate

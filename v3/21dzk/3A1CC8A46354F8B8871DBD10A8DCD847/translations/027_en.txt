The sequence is not fixed.

"Furthermore good son... ultimate truth": This seventh round explains through analogies. The dharmas and analogies explained in this seventh round generally clarify that the essence of two truths has no distinctions. Following that person's wisdom and the fourfold two truths of emptiness-existence, phenomena-principle, shallow-deep, and designation-meaning within dharmas, superiority and inferiority mutually form conventional and ultimate. Therefore worldly people only know birth from parents and call this conventional. Transcendent people know dependent origination and call this ultimate meaning. This divides two truths following human wisdom. Calling the coarse and shallow provisional phenomena of birth from parents conventional, and calling the fine and deep real dharmas of dependent origination ultimate. This divides two truths following dharmas. Generally clarifying the distinctions of two truths through dharmas and analogies, with no separate approaches. Carefully observing the sūtra's meaning, though having seven levels, reasoning through principles shows no difference from treatises. Details follow the explanation below.

"Ancient explanations... Nirvāṇa etc.": What follows relates Master Yuan's explanations. From "ancient explanations" to "according to the sixth therefore called first" - this page and a half of text is from Master Yuan's Nirvāṇa Sūtra Commentary, volume five. There are no differences. Scholars should investigate. "Roughly dividing into two etc." means calling nature-establishment and nature-breaking "lesser," calling characteristic-breaking and reality-revealing "greater." "Finely dividing into four etc." - Master Yuan says: These four are named dharmas in relation to meanings; sūtras and treatises have no names. Though sūtras and treatises lack these names, they truly have these meanings. Within greater and lesser, each divides shallow and deep, thus having four schools. Speaking of the nature-establishment school, also called the dependent origination school. This is the shallow within Hīnayāna,

proclaiming that all dharmas each have essential nature. Though explaining having nature, all arise from conditions, not the same as heretics establishing natural nature. This school corresponds to Abhidharma. Next, the nature-breaking school, also called the provisional name school. This is the deep within Hīnayāna, proclaiming all dharmas are empty and provisional without nature. Not the same as the previous school establishing dharma's self-nature. Though dharmas are natureless, they are not without provisional characteristics. This school corresponds to the Satyasiddhi treatise. Next, the characteristic-breaking school, also called the non-true school. This is the shallow within Mahāyāna, clarifying that the empty and provisional characteristics in the previous school also have no existence. Like a person viewing a mirage from afar as water, viewing closely reveals nothing originally there. Not only is there no nature, but even water's characteristics are absent. All dharmas resemble this. Though explaining no-characteristics, it hasn't yet revealed dharma's reality. Later, the reality-revealing school, also called the true school. This is the deep within Mahāyāna, proclaiming all dharmas exist due to false imagination. False imagination has no essence; when arising it must depend on the real. The real means the so-called tathāgatagarbha nature - countless dharmas of the Ganges sands sharing the same essence in conditional gathering, inseparable and undetached, unbroken and undifferentiated. This true nature's dependent origination assembles and completes saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Being gathered by the real, nothing is not real. Explaining this real nature is therefore called the true school.

"Among these four... therefore discussing all": In this text, using the deep to encompass the shallow etc. - Master Yuan says: Regarding schools to explain truth approaches, there are separately four: first, regarding schools to divide dharmas; second, using deep to encompass shallow; third, proceeding through dharmas to discriminate; fourth, explaining unity and separation. Now matching the seven rounds to the four schools refers to the second approach of deep encompassing shallow. Therefore saying "in this text using deep to encompass shallow." If within Hīnayāna, the nature-establishment school is shallow, breaking nature is deep. If within Mahāyāna, breaking characteristics is

shallow, revealing reality is deep. Also like the dharma-characteristic conventional truth in the nature-breaking school. Saying all dharmas are impermanent etc., because this is dharma's real characteristic, it's called conventional truth. This conventional truth is the ultimate truth dharma of the nature-establishment school. All others should be understood accordingly. Within deep schools' conventional, because it encompasses shallow schools' ultimate, it's called "using deep to encompass shallow." Details follow that master's chapter commentary explanations.

"Regarding the initial school... cannot elaborate extensively": "According to Vibhāṣā etc., fully explaining seven rounds etc." - Saṃyuktahṛdaya, Abhidharmakośa etc. also explain two truths. Following Abhidharmakośa twenty-two's explanation: Regarding that thing, when the pot is not yet broken, when water is not yet broken, using worldly conceptual names to provisionally establish pot and water. Because provisionally established as existing, called conventional. Depending on conventional principle, explaining pot etc. as real is called conventional truth. If there's a thing's essence different from these pots etc., it's called ultimate truth. That thing's awareness - even when breaking that thing, that awareness doesn't disappear, and when using wisdom to analyze away, if that awareness still exists, one should know to call that thing ultimate truth. One should understand that explanation. Saṃyuktahṛdaya treatise, also as explained next below. Now being equal to that treatise, therefore placing the word "etc." Vibhāṣā treatise seventy-seven has eight different explanations. Extensively explaining two truths, following meanings and fully discussing, not exceeding seven rounds, therefore saying "fully explaining seven rounds."

"First, emotional-rational division... as ultimate meaning": What follows draws the sequence of seven round approaches following meanings. This is the first approach. According to tradition, among the seven, the sixth lacks text. The remaining six rounds all have authentic texts. Now I consider this incorrect. All seven exist. In this text, among these seven rounds, the second and seventh depend on Saṃyuktahṛdaya text.

The remaining five rounds depend on Vibhāṣā explanations. Vibhāṣā seventy-seven has eight different explanations. Now this first approach corresponds to that sixth meaning, therefore that text says: "Again making this explanation: Following and according with worldly explanations is called conventional; following and according with noble sages' explanations is called ultimate." How can this be known? This chapter immediately says: "First, initially regarding emotional-rational to divide into two. Calling the combination of five aggregates 'so-and-so.' Ordinary beings follow what they call, calculating there are self and persons. This is called conventional truth. Sages understand there is no 'so-and-so' in the aggregates, and apart from aggregates there is also nothing. Called ultimate meaning." By this it's clearly known to correspond to the sixth meaning.

Question: Self etc. are what emotions consider existent, originally absent in dharmas. What is explained as truth? Master Yuan says: Ordinary beings take aggregates as self. Aggregates following emotional grasping are called self and persons, explained as conventional truth. Not completely without dharmas. That ultimate truth - sages know aggregates are not the self's possession, from sage understanding explaining as selflessness, called ultimate truth. Also not without dharmas.

"Second, provisional-real division... explaining ultimate meaning": This second round depends on Saṃyuktahṛdaya text. Dharmas like pots and clothes, having names without reality, are called conventional truth. Dharmas like aggregates etc., having names and reality, are explained as ultimate truth. "If analyzing dharmas etc." is text from Saṃyuktahṛdaya treatise volume ten. Therefore that text says: "What are the equal and ultimate meaning's characteristics? Answer: When analyzing phenomena, if abandoning names then explaining as equal; when analyzing without anything to abandon, this is ultimate meaning." That treatise's explanation says: "When analyzing phenomena abandoning names" - this is equal phenomena. That text

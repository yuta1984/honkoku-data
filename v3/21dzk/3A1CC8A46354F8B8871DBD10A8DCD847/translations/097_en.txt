These eleven forms all mutually interpenetrate, combining to form one place without separate locations. This is the meaning of same-place non-separation. Saying "in one aṇu form there are eight" refers to the four great elements and four dusts. "Adding sound makes nine" means if there is sound in one subtle particle, then divine ears, wheel-turning kings, and final-body bodhisattvas hear it.

From "or eye, body, earth" to "combining to form aṇu." This clarifies the meaning of non-separation regarding seven phenomena, while distinguishing from other schools. The seven phenomena of eye, body, earth, etc., mutually correspond and interpenetrate, dwelling in the same place. This is the meaning of same-place non-separation. Saying "one cause and one effect together in one place" uses this text as proof. Because among those seven phenomena there are six created forms, the creating earth great element also has six earths. But collectively calling them earth is because the meaning of earth is equal. If not so, with one cause and six effects, how could one explain "one cause, one effect"? Using six creating elements corresponding to six created forms, each cause and effect being one, establishes "one cause, one effect together in one place." Unlike the Sarvāstivāda school, etc. - the Sarvāstivāda school holds that subtle particles are separate yet aggregate together, with different substantial subtle particles collecting to form color aggregates, etc. Also, Sautrāntika masters accumulate small to form large. If following those schools, various color subtle particles dwell in two places. Then same-place and the other three non-separations would all lack distinction. Now distinguishing these, hence saying "not like, etc."

From "now the Mahāyāna" to "non-separation." If Hīnayāna, etc., originally there are subtle particles whose substance is real and constant, though equally dwelling in one place, their substances are separate. Now the Mahāyāna

never has subtle particles arise. The treatise says "if arising from self-seeds, they necessarily arise as aggregates - sometimes fine, sometimes medium, sometimes large. Following size, they are immediately one substance, not collections of different substances." All same-type and different-type great elements and created forms have no separate subtle particles. Following whatever aggregates exist, all mutually interpenetrate - this is called non-separation. Like when subtle particles of form, etc., reach the aṇu level, if following places without faculties, in rootless forms there are eight aṇu. Adding sound makes nine. If adding forms with faculties to these rootless forms, adding body makes ten; following other faculties makes eleven. These various forms, following their correspondences, whether many or few, equally dwell in one place, mutually interpenetrating with no difference in location. The reason we can know there are so many forms in one dust-place is that the faculties universally function there. Eyes see forms, noses smell fragrances, tongues taste flavors, bodies feel tangibles. Hence we know one earth great element place contains all dusts. Depending on faculty-consciousnesses arising, each knows its object. Hence saying "because mind knows objects, etc." This is same-place non-separation.

From "harmoniously mixed non-mutual" to "mixed non-separation." Harmoniously mixed non-separation - the meaning of dwelling together in one place mutually interpenetrating is identical to the previous same-place non-separation. The chapter master's Yogācāra commentary says: "Also, same-place non-separation means following within all great element subtle particles with and without faculties, there are immediately all created form subtle particles according to correspondence, further mutually interpenetrating to combine forming one thing, without separate subtle particles dwelling in two places. Harmoniously mixed non-separation means immediately these single great element subtle particles with all other great elements and created

subtle particles. Though equally in one place, they do not form one substance. Because their natures are separate and their functions different. We know they are not one nature. Because faculties universally function among them without mutual obstruction, we know they are in the same place. This is called same-place non-separation. Because natures are separate and functions different, it is called 'mixed'; because same place, it is called 'harmonious.' Places are not two; though both depend on one location, substances remain separate." [Above commentary text]

Question: What is the difference between these two? Explanation: The meaning that faculties universally function without mutual obstruction is same-place non-separation meaning. The meaning that natures and functions are separate yet places are not two is harmoniously mixed non-separation meaning. It is not like calling the meaning of things like sesame and beans being analyzed and dwelling together in one place mutually intermixed "harmoniously mixed non-separation." Hence saying "however, cannot be explained, etc."

From "also explaining great elements and created" to "not same place." This is the second explanation. Among the four dusts, the great elements and created forms of the form dust are called same-type; other dusts corresponding to this are called different-type. Now regarding same-type great element created forms, explaining harmoniously mixed non-separation meaning, hence two distinctions. In Hīnayāna other schools, even subtle particles within same-type great elements and created forms dwell in two places; different-types are also thus. Now distinguishing these, hence saying "not like other schools where same-type and different-type subtle particles are separate and not in the same place."

From "question: matured existence" to "hence not immediately that." This is the fifth question. This question and answer are both text from Yogācārabhūmi fifty-four. Hence that text says: "Question: Matured continuity sometimes also has obtainable growth and expansion. Why is the matured inclusive stream not immediately nourishing? Answer: Because there is separately a nourishing continuity that can embrace and maintain the matured equal-flow stream,

there is present growth." [Above treatise text] Explanation: The chapter master's Yogācāra commentary says: "Using nourishing stream to resource and nourish the matured stream, separately there is nourishing - nourishing is not immediately matured." [Above commentary text]

Master Jing's commentary says: "The question's meaning is that the matured form substance continues from before, from beginning as infant to completion of growth, during which sometimes fat as infant and thin as child, or fat as child and thin as youth. Then the matured substance also has growth. Why only embrace matured and not immediately be nourishing? Saying 'because separately there is nourishing continuity, etc.' - the answer's meaning is that matured form goes from small to large, from beginning as infant to child form, etc. When infant reward form repays causes, then definitely there is no dependence on conditions for fat or thin. Simultaneously there are separate nourishing root great elements; depending on present conditions, sometimes fat, sometimes thin. Child reward form, by previous karma power, greatly differs from before; youth-time form is even larger than before, also by past karma. Yet in each position, separately there is nourishing depending on conditions for increase or decrease, moment by moment repaying causes - small rewards naturally cease, large reward forms increase. Yet within each moment of matured continuity, there are nourishing forms that accord with and maintain the matured. These nourishing forms, depending on conditions at that time, have characteristics of fat, thin, increase, decrease, etc. Hence it is not that matured immediately has that nourishing." [Above commentary text]

"Like outer ramparts defending and supporting the inner city" - this is Abhidharmakośa text. Hence that treatise's second fascicle says: "Nourishing continuity constantly can protect and maintain matured continuity, like outer ramparts defending and supporting the inner city." Now quoting that text immediately proves the Yogācāra meaning.

From "question: are they one four" to "creating one?" This is the sixth question. The question immediately depends on the Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā.

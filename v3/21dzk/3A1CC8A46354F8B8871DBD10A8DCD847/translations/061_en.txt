[one] cannot become a sage. Hence [it serves as] the leak-essence. The previous three fruits, etc., though having cultivation delusions, still can become sages, hence cultivation leaks are also [considered] leak-instruments. If according to the two eliminations, seeing leaks are precisely seeing-eliminated, thinking leaks are cultivation-eliminated. Love, mindfulness, etc. five correspondingly pervade both. This seven leaks doctrine is as explained in the *Nirvāṇa Sūtra*, *Satyasiddhi Śāstra*, etc. Also in *Āgama Sūtra* volume two, in the section on leak-exhaustion-extinction, [it] explains seven elimination-leaks. Extensively as explained there.

"Seventh, eight divisions... eight mutually contradictory": Dharma-essence means knowing the essence of form, etc., taking names from objects. Hence [it is] called "intrinsic-nature discrimination." Distinctions mean regarding that essence, discriminating the distinct meanings of visible, invisible, etc. In total-grasping discrimination, self, sentient beings, etc., and the fourth self and fifth self-possession - what differences do these have? Explanation: According to Mahāyāna Ji, the previous total-grasping [concerns] the two graspings, having distinctions due to discriminating self and self-possession. Among the eight discriminations, the first three are dharma-grasping expedients, four and five are person-grasping expedients, the latter three are three-poison expedients. Also, the first three are expedients pervading the two graspings, four and five are only person-grasping expedients. These eight discriminations all do not take the time when dharma-grasping properly arises. Because dharma-grasping does not produce karmic results. The Great Tang Tripiṭaka says: "The eight types of discrimination all take undefiled-neutral matured-arising wisdom as their intrinsic nature." Alternatively possible, investigation-analysis serves as intrinsic nature. As explained in *Ximing's Deep Secret Commentary* volume two. The *Compilation* says: "These eight discriminations are all dharma-grasping. Because that ignorance is deluded about suchness, discriminative grasping turns regarding form, etc. affairs. The fourth and fifth, though object to self-realms, because [they are] not defiled, [are] included in dharma-grasping."

Also, the first three types are separately-arisen dharma-grasping. The latter five are precisely dharma-grasping having the same essence as affliction-obstacles. The fourth and fifth, because [they] arise with the same essence as self-view, following self's operational characteristics, discriminate self-other distinction, etc. characteristics. The latter three are precisely the same essence as greed, etc., following greed, etc. activities, discriminating opposing, concordant, and neither characteristics. The present chapter author's intent - that doctrine is not so. Since [it] already says "through eight discriminations [one] can generate three affairs," hence know [it] takes dharma-grasping, etc. expedients. Why do the latter three not take fundamentals? Explanation: [To] distinguish the different intents of expedient-generation and fundamental-generated, [and] manifest the latter three as expedients capable of generating the fundamental three poisons, hence also taking expedients.

"First three generate text... principle pervades seeing-elimination": The first three generate discrimination's dependent-conditioned affairs, etc. - the dependence is precisely the sentient world, the conditions are the instrumental world. The latter two affairs are both the sentient world. The first three discriminations, when wanting to arouse the fundamental three dharma-graspings, condition the self-dependent body and the transformed-aspect-divisions of the instrumental world, perfume and form the seeds of self-body and instrumental world, generating that later time's self-body and instrumental world. Self-body is called dependence, external instruments are called conditions. When dependence-conditions are already generated, [they] immediately generate the fundamental three types of dharma-grasping. Hence [it] says "the first three generate discrimination-grasping dependent-conditioned affairs." Establishing the next two discriminations as expedients, [they] can arouse fundamental self and self-possession grasping and pride. Without discussing perfuming seeds, [they] generate later self-view, etc. The latter three discriminations mutually serve as expedients, drawing forth fundamental greed, hatred, delusion, etc. Also without discussing perfuming seeds, [they] accordingly generate greed, etc.

"Again there are eight entanglements... principle also pervades seeing": Among these eight entanglements, the first two obstruct lifting, the next two obstruct stopping, the next two obstruct abandoning, the latter two obstruct precepts. Explaining by constraining nature, principle pervades seeing and cultivation. Because [they] arise following the power of the two afflictions. Extensively as explained in treatises.

"Eighth, nine bonds... bonds pervade cultivation-elimination": Nine bonds means love-bond, anger-bond, pride-bond, ignorance-bond, view-bond, grasping-bond, doubt-bond, jealousy-bond, and stinginess-bond. Explanation: Regarding these nine bonds, there are three meanings. First is intrinsic nature, second is function, third is positional distinctions. Speaking of "intrinsic nature": love-bond means three-realm greed, anger-bond means desire-realm anger, pride-bond means seven types of pride, ignorance-bond means three-realm ignorance, view-bond means self-view and extreme views. Grasping-bond means view-grasping and precept-grasping, doubt-bond means hesitation regarding the four truths and three jewels, jealousy-bond means secondary afflictions, stinginess-bond is also secondary afflictions. Speaking of "function": those having this do not become weary of the three realms. Through this, [they] successively manifest unwholesomeness and wholesome does not manifest. Speaking of "position" - at what position? Namely at the position where different fruits arise in future lives. Extensively as explained in *Abhidharmasamuccaya* volume six. The two-elimination discrimination can be known from the text.

"Ninth, latent tendencies... explaining elimination boundaries": Among the nine latent tendencies, the first three are precisely the seeds of fundamental delusions, hence all three are called latent tendencies. Among them, anger only takes seeds, greed and delusion also pervade the manifest. Innate [tendencies] deluded about principle that do not generate evil actions are all included in the first three. Also anger has [instances] arising together with views and doubt. Since these are not what the worldly path can subdue in manifestation, [they] can also be included in the first three. Though [their] nature is unwholesome and exists only in the desire realm, because [they] arise in the bodies of those free from desire, [they] can also distantly support and generate immovable karma, but because [they] do not directly generate, [they] are not bound to the upper realms. Like the Tathāgata's arrival depending on lower ignorance, yet that ignorance is not bound to the upper realms. Fourth, three-poison supreme mind - "supreme" means superior, only taking desire-realm delusion about affairs that arise, [being] coarse-grade delusions subdued by the worldly path. Fifth, ignorance-dwelling-ground - this is precisely included in cognitive-obstacle categories, [being] various afflictions whether manifest or seed. Calling this "afflictions" is said in comparison to the coarse. Sixth, eliminated by seeing truth, etc. - not entering the first ground, afflictions in human bodies capable of obstructing the seeing path are called "eliminated by seeing truth." Afflictions in three-vehicle sages' bodies capable of obstructing the cultivation path are called "cultivation-eliminated delusions." These two delusions are obstacles pervading the three vehicles. Hence know [they are] afflictions, not cognitive [obstacles]. All afflictions before the seventh ground are called "impure ground delusions." All afflictions from the eighth ground up are called "pure ground delusions." These two delusions are only bodhisattva obstacles, hence [they] are cognitive [obstacles]. Extensively as explained in *Ratnagotravibhāga* and *Buddhadhātu [Śāstra]*. Sixth, only seeing, etc. - [this] is two-elimination discrimination.

"Ninth, ten afflictions... positions and sequences of elimination": Ten afflictions means opening the views among the six afflictions into five, hence becoming ten. Ten scatterings means among the tenth scattering-discrimination of the fundamental discrimination, etc. ten discriminations, there are again ten types. Namely no-nature discrimination, existence-nature discrimination, augmentation discrimination, diminishment discrimination, single-nature discrimination, different-nature discrimination, intrinsic-nature discrimination, distinction discrimination, following-name-meaning discrimination, and following-meaning-name discrimination. These ten discriminations

[about] the inclusion of that many phenomena of aggregates." If regarding non-separation inclusion, whether internal or external, among all existing aggregates, following within these aggregates, as long as one can obtain that many dharma-characteristics, one explains this as "that aggregate includes that many phenomena." This should be understood.

Explanation: The chapter master's *Yogācāra Commentary* says: "Mutual inclusion means inclusion regarding essence. Each includes itself with its own essence. Realm inclusion means contrasting essence with function. Non-separation inclusion means essence and function do not separate." [Above is commentary text] Now saying "like stones, maṇi jewels, etc." refers to non-separation inclusion to clarify the many and few of aggregates. Hence the treatise text says: "Sometimes in aggregates only one great element can be obtained, as in stones, maṇi jewels, pearls, lapis lazuli, conch shells, jade, coral, etc. Or as in pools, marshes, ditches, channels, rivers, etc. Or as in flames, lamps and candles, etc. Or as in four-directional wind wheels, dusty and dust-free winds, etc." [Above is treatise text]

Explanation: The treatise extensively lists fourteen actual phenomena. Now this chapter briefly lists eight phenomena: First, stones; second, maṇi jewels - these two are only earth element. Third, rivers; fourth, pools and marshes - these two are only water element. Fifth, flames; sixth, lamps and candles - these two are only fire element. Seventh, dusty wind; eighth, dust-free wind - these two are only wind element. Regarding "dusty wind, etc.," the *Abhidharmahṛdaya* ninth [fascicle] says: "What is the difference between wind and wind-realm? Some say wind is wind-seed, because it is not worldly nomenclature. Some say this is also worldly nomenclature. Dusty wind is like this comparison." [Above is treatise text] Also in the *Benevolent Kings Sutra*, it explains "there are five-colored winds." In that sutra's commentary it says: "By the seashore there are five-colored sands. When great winds arise, sand flies following the wind. All worldly people call it five-colored wind." These comparisons are called dusty wind.

From "or only two great elements" to "or all four great elements together." "Like hot maṇi jewels, etc." - the original treatise text says: "Sometimes in aggregates two great elements can be obtained, as in snow-wet tree leaves, flowers, fruits, etc. Or as in hot maṇi jewels, etc. Sometimes in aggregates three great elements can be obtained, as in hot trees, etc. Or as in shaking movement. Sometimes in aggregates four great elements can be obtained - namely in internal form aggregates. As the Blessed One explained: In each separate internal body, hair, body hair, etc., down to excrement, are the internal earth realm. Urine, etc. are the internal water realm. Whatever warmth exists in the body is the internal fire realm. Upward-moving winds, etc. are the internal wind realm. Thus if in this aggregate those characteristics can be obtained, those characteristics are said to exist. If they cannot be obtained, those characteristics are said to not exist." [Above is treatise text]

Explanation: Hot maṇi jewels - "hot" is fire element. The maṇi jewel's substance is hard, hence earth element. Snow-wet trees - "snow-wet" is water element. The tree's substance is firm and strong, hence earth element. The rest should be understood by analogy.

Question: According to the Mahāyāna school, in hot maṇi jewels, since there is no hot nature, how do they later transform into hot, etc.?

Explanation: Speaking precisely, creating [elements] arise separately moment by moment from seeds. Hence at the later time of heat, etc., now they are not the old earth elements, etc. This means the formerly non-hot maṇi jewel arose together from one earth element seed. Up to the later transformation stage, they arise suddenly from four great element seeds. However, in this text, based on manifest characteristics, through similarity it explains that former maṇi jewels transform into present heat. This is because in consciousness, having those seeds, when meeting conditions they immediately arise. *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-four says: "What is seed-arising? All forms each arise from their own seeds. Like hard aggregates - sometimes meeting conditions they produce flowing wetness.

Flowing wetness meeting conditions again produces hardness." Up to saying: "Through such [processes], though lacking intrinsic characteristics, they have their realms, and from those aggregates, differences in form-dharmas arise - this is called seed-arising."

From "or only having form" to "when vessels have sound": Below separately clarifying the increase and decrease of created [forms]. This is the chapter master, based on the *Abhidharma Treatise* and *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-four, etc., explaining the increase and decrease of created [forms]. *Yogācārabhūmi* third does not explain this text. *Abhidharma Treatise* sixth, after explaining the increase and decrease of creating [elements], says: "Created forms are also thus. Sometimes aggregates have only one created form, like light, etc." Up to saying: "Sometimes there are four created forms, like sugar lumps, etc. Sometimes there are five created forms - namely when this has sound. Extensively as explained there."

Explanation: Though creating [elements] exist together, they need not necessarily be in the same location. Therefore separately explaining the increase and decrease of created [forms]. Because various sunlight travels alone, and fragrances, etc. are separate from great elements. The forms of concentration and path precepts arising in the formless realm lack the four great elements. If so, how do great elements have the meaning of dependent cause regarding created forms?

Explanation: If power depends on that existence, all have dependent causes. Extensively as the chapter master's *Yogācāra Chapter* explains. "If there is taste-tangible, there must also be fragrance-form" - though the form realm has tangible, it need not necessarily have fragrance. Now speaking about the desire realm, hence no obstruction. "Or only having four" etc. means among the five objects, excluding sound, the remaining four - namely form, fragrance, taste, tangible.

From "or there is body faculty" to "with sound making seven": The *Compendium* revises this text saying: "In faculty-possessing aggregates, separated from other faculty locations, there are six co-arising - namely the four of form, etc., together with body and earth element. Having other faculty locations, sometimes seven co-arise - namely adding any one from eye, etc." Immediately refuting the chapter master, saying: "In faculty-possessing aggregates, there is no separation from great elements. One cannot say body [has] five, others [have] six."

Now rescuing this, saying: Though creating [elements] exist together, among those created, manifest quantity is indefinite - sometimes one, sometimes two, up to sometimes seven. Now clarifying these differences and manifest quantity, hence saying "body five, others six." Namely wishing to show that in faculty-possessing aggregates there are necessarily great elements together, hence repeatedly in the next text saying "like the above created forms, body increased by earth makes six, up to increased by sound makes eleven." Hence the chapter master's explanation accords with profound intent. The deep meaning-ocean of texts - how could shallow wisdom not be confused?

From "like the above created forms" to "increased by sound makes eleven": The third below clarifies the characteristics of increase and decrease where creating and created mutually do not separate. Saying "like the above created forms" refers back to what was explained above. "Body increased by earth makes six" - in the above separate explanation, "sometimes there is body faculty together with form, etc. four" only clarified the characteristics of being together with five in created faculty-possessing aggregates separated from other faculty locations, but had not yet separately clarified the characteristics of being together with creating [elements]. Now pointing to that, hence saying "body increased by earth makes six." Immediately adding any one faculty from eye, etc. to these six, hence saying "eye, etc. increased makes seven." Immediately adding any one great element from water, fire, wind to these seven makes eight. Immediately adding any one great element from water, fire, wind to these eight makes nine. Immediately adding any one great element from water, fire, wind to these nine makes ten. Immediately adding sound to these ten makes eleven. To manifest this meaning, *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-four says:

Question: In the form aggregate, by how many things is the eye included? Answer: If according to mutual inclusion, there is only one thing - namely the pure form that eye-consciousness depends on. If

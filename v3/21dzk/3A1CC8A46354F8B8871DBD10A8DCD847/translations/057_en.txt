[One] attains that fruit. "Once-returner" means obtaining the path in the human realm, being born in the desire heavens, then coming back to the human realm to attain the ultimate fruit. If stated completely, one should say "one who goes and returns once," but now the character "going" is abbreviated. Not saying "one going" but naming it "once-returner" is because if one comes there must be going, but having going does not necessarily mean coming. Because [one] comes once, [it is] named "once-returner." Regarding gradual non-returners, etc.: Advancing from the previous once-returner fruit, [one] eliminates the ninth grade afflictions of the desire realm, and when abiding in the liberation path, this is called the non-returner fruit. "Non-returner" means [one] will definitely not be reborn again in places where [one] was previously born, hence [one] receives the name non-returner. "The remainder reaches up to the Peak of Existence, etc.": When the nine grades of desire [realm afflictions] have been eliminated, [one] immediately receives the name non-returner. Up until before the uninterrupted path that eliminates the ninth grade afflictions of the Peak of Existence, all are called non-returners, hence [it] says "nine grounds indefinite."

"Those who transcend... afflictions including five grades of cultivation": Below this clarifies transcendent fruit attainment. Regarding transcending the first fruit, etc.: Transcendent people again have two types: first, transcendence in the ordinary stage; second, later transcendence in the noble stage. Regarding ordinary stage transcendence: The previous three fruits can have transcendent meaning, but definitely not the fourth, because Peak of Existence afflictions cannot be subdued and eliminated by worldly paths. Among those who transcend the previous three, those who transcend stream-entry use worldly paths during the heterogeneous stage, capable of subduing one grade, two grades, up to five grades of desire realm cultivation-eliminated afflictions. Later, because [they] properly cultivate according to Buddha's teaching and enter seeing truth, at the time of the sixteen-mind path-class wisdom, [they] realize stream-entry fruit and are named "transcendent." Using worldly path to subdue desire realm cultivation-eliminating afflictions and various view afflictions, using one path to suddenly eliminate [them] is called "transcendent stream-entry." That is, using the seeing path, [one] is capable of departing from the first five grades of cultivation afflictions, hence explained as named transcendent. Another explanation:

Stream-entry fruit definitely has no transcenders. Because there definitely is no previous fruit that can be transcended. In various sacred teachings, [they] do not explain stream-entry as being named transcendent. This explanation seems superior. [One] should further examine the texts. Question: If the previous three fruits can have transcendent meaning but definitely not the fourth, because worldly paths cannot subdue Peak of Existence afflictions, then why does the *Bodhisattva Dwelling in the Womb Sūtra* volume five, Conduct Chapter, say: "There are beings whose stage, from ordinary person ground, does not turn toward faith ground, dharma ground, stream-entry, once-return, non-return, [but] takes arhatship, extensively explained"? The text being already clear, how can there be no ordinary persons transcending the previous three fruits to take arhat fruit? If permitting this, how could [they] use worldly paths to eliminate Peak of Existence afflictions and view afflictions? Even subduing is difficult to attain, how much more achieving elimination? Explaining: Examining that sūtra text, the practice-creating bodhisattva raises the karmic results of twenty-five types of conduct and asks the Buddha. The World-Honored One first sets aside past and future karmic results of conduct, only answering the karmic results of the Tathāgata's present body's conduct, not yet answering the karmic results of the remaining twenty-four types of conduct. Now saying "there are beings who do not turn toward faith ground, dharma ground... up to non-return, taking arhatship" refers to the karmic results of the seventeenth type of conduct among the twenty-five. Since the Buddha has not yet answered, who dares to explain it? However, according to principle, what that sūtra explains - that there are beings who from ordinary person stage take arhat fruit, or there are beings who, heading toward arhatship, return and fall back to ordinary person ground, etc. - this is provisional, not actual, because [it] draws in the timid and weak. Like Pure-Eye Heavenly Son, Dharma-Wealth King, Śāriputra, etc. in the *Fundamental Activities Sūtra* who regress and enter into ordinary person unwholesome dharmas - this is precisely that example. This meaning is still difficult; scholars should contemplate [it].

"Once-returner transcendence... non-perception cultivation nine existences": Regarding those who transcend once-return: First, in the alien birth stage, using conventional paths to subdue desire cultivation afflictions, having already exhausted six grades or seven to eight grades of afflictions, later entering the seeing path and attaining once-returner fruit. This is called "transcending once-return." Because this person does not take stream-entry fruit and transcends the previous fruit, [they] receive the name transcendent. Regarding those who transcend non-return: First using worldly paths to subdue desire cultivation afflictions, because the nine grades are exhausted, [in] the four grounds of the form realm and lower three of formless [realm], in these seven grounds, perhaps separating from one grade of afflictions, again completely empty. Following what is appropriate, later entering seeing truth, at the time of path-class wisdom, [one] attains non-returner fruit. Not taking the previous two fruits but attaining non-return, [it is] explained as being named transcendent. Also, non-returner fruit depends on the cultivation path to be attained, but now if attained in the seeing path, [it is] also named transcendent.

"There is stream-entry transcendence... hence named stream-entry": Above clarified first ordinary stage transcendence; now in this text passage [it] precisely clarifies later noble transcendence. The *Abhidharmasamuccaya* explains that stream-entry fruit has two departures: first gradual, second sudden. Sudden departure means having entered truth direct realization, depending on calming not-yet-attained concentration, manifesting supramundane path, suddenly eliminating all afflictions of the three realms. If eliminating grade by grade separately, only two fruits are established: stream-entry fruit and arhat fruit. Eliminating grade by grade separately means suddenly eliminating the supreme-supreme grade latent afflictions that are eliminated by cultivation in the desire, form, and formless three realms. Thus up to the warming grade, extensively as explained there. Explaining: Having attained the first fruit, generally bundling the eighty-one grades of cultivation-eliminated afflictions of nine grounds, using nine uninterrupted and nine liberation paths, capable of exhausting all outflows. Like breaking bamboo to cut [them].

The path that eliminates one grade of desire [afflictions], this very [path] can eliminate supreme grade of Peak of Existence. All noble paths, up to

the lowest-lowest should also be understood thus. When having eliminated six grades of desire [afflictions], if [one] eliminates six grades of the eight upper realm grounds, [it is] not called once-return. [If one] eliminates nine grades of desire [afflictions] and also nine grades of the eight upper realm grounds, [it is] not called non-return. Because [one] suddenly goes from stream-entry to arhatship, in stream-entry's uninterrupted [continuation], immediately establishing arhat fruit, not taking the middle two is called "noble stage transcendence."

"Arhat alone... precisely concentration obstacles, etc.": Above clarified voice-hearers' gradual and sudden fruit attainment; now in this text passage [it] precisely clarifies pratyekabuddhās' obstacle elimination and fruit attainment. Pratyekabuddhās' learning stage is the same as transcending non-return. If reaching no-more-learning, [it is] also the same as arhat fruit. Question: Why in pratyekabuddhās does [the text] not mark the names of the previous three fruits but only marks the arhat fruit name? Explaining: Master Long said: Pratyekabuddhās' fruits have subtle and difficult-to-know differences between approaching and [attaining] fruit, hence only one fruit name is established. "Precisely concentration obstacles, etc.": What was explained above as partially eliminating cognitive obstacles refers to concentration obstacles, etc. *Sixty-two* says: "Also, all liberations are manifested through liberation from cognitive obstacles. Through this, voice-hearers, pratyekabuddhās, etc. necessarily attain liberation from cognitive obstacles." Now precisely pointing to that, hence [it] says "precisely concentration obstacles, etc."

"Bodhisattva people... all as in constant explanations": Above clarified two vehicles; now in this text passage [it] precisely clarifies bodhisattvas' obstacle elimination and fruit attainment. This means bodhisattvas are capable of eliminating. "All three vehicles are capable of subduing the manifest activity of two obstacles, etc.": This generally distinguishes the differences in subduing afflictions. However, "bodhisattvas subdue and attain concentration to attain fruit" refers to attaining cessation of perception and sensation concentration. Among bodhisattvas, some enter the first ground and attain cessation concentration; some reach the seventh ground's full mind before attaining cessation concentration, as explained in the treatise. "Attaining fruit" means attaining dharma

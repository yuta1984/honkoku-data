called developing cause. Rice again produces rice, millet again produces millet - this serves as self-seed cause, now called determining-difference cause. Gathering the previous seven causes, harmoniously accomplishing results serves as collaborative cause, now called cooperative cause. Frost and snow hindering growth while causing grain and fruit to bear fruit serves as conflicting cause. Wind and sun causing drying, obtaining non-decay serves as non-conflicting cause. Grain seeds obtaining fruit thus possess ten causes. All other neutral things follow this example. However, the ancient teachers' explanation of causes - producing all dharmas with complete ten causes - this third explanation corresponds to the ancient teachers' doctrine. Various ancient worthies including [certain] Dharma Master all made this explanation.

From "six causes produce" to "all are dominant conditions": Speaking of "six causes": first, similar-type cause; second, universal cause; third, simultaneous cause; fourth, corresponding cause; fifth, retribution cause; sixth, productive cause. Explaining briefly their essence: first, similar-type cause involves only conditioned dharmas, with produced results necessarily having the same type. Another explanation: suchness first hidden, later revealed - since nature-types are equal, [this is] also similar-type cause. Second, universal cause: taking only conditioned defilement categories as this cause's essence, also extending to both proximate and distant [relations]. According to Sarvāstivāda's eleven universal servants and simultaneous dharmas as universal cause essence. Under suffering [truth] there are seven: five views, doubt, and delusion; under origination [truth] there are four: two views, doubt, and delusion. "Two views" refers to wrong view and view-grasping. These eleven universally bind the five gates, universally producing all defilements, hence being universal causes. Following Mahāyāna, collectively taking what is eliminated by insight as this cause's essence. Since confusion about truth-principles is the root of defilement, all have power to increase defilement. This extends to both seeds and manifestations. Also, according to principle,

explaining [this], it also extends to what is eliminated by cultivation. Like how Manas defilements universally increase defilement - how could this not be this cause? The cultivation-eliminated defilements arising in the other six consciousnesses also have mutual enhancement meanings through successive [influence], hence also universal causes. It's not necessarily only universal object-engagement and universal binding. Third, simultaneous cause: taking only the conditioned, because this cause's essence arises simultaneously with results. The unconditioned has no arising, hence not this essence. In Mahāyāna, the four great [elements] sometimes simultaneous, sometimes not; sometimes one great [element] first, then the remaining greats arise; sometimes greats arise first, derived matter arising later. According to Sarvāstivāda, taking greats facing derived [matter], derived [matter] is not simultaneous inclusion due to different natures. According to Mahāyāna school, [it's] also simultaneous cause. What mutually produces intimately necessarily has same nature. Even with different natures, having simultaneous power is also simultaneous cause. Fourth, corresponding cause: taking only conditioned mind-clusters as essence. Only having object-conditions. If present mental factors are distant, corresponding causes must be simultaneous. If using mind's seeds to produce present mind and mental factors, [they] necessarily simultaneous with results. When receiving results, definitely not same moment. Seeds in this consciousness producing correspondence, hence named corresponding cause. Fifth, retribution cause: taking only unwholesome and contaminated wholesome as this cause's essence. If neutral nature, conceptual seeds producing retribution are similar-type causes, not retribution causes. Sixth, productive cause: taking all dharmas as essence. All dharmas facing produced results either abide in non-obstruction or can pull and generate - all having function to produce results, hence named productive. This briefly explains the six causes' essences. Speaking of "manifest six causes," *Xiǎnyáng* eighteen explaining "all are dominant conditions" - [this] is not exact treatise text. Taking the meaning and citing it. *Xiǎnyáng* eighteen specifically lists six

names, only excluding retribution, refuting the other five causes. Sarvāstivāda holds there are six causes - five causes are causal condition nature, productive [cause] is dominant condition. Now that school's teachers, depending on manifest dharmas, establish six causes, holding there are causal conditions. Hence the treatise master refutes [this]. That retribution cause - wholesome and unwholesome karma attracting neutral results - has no doctrinal differences, hence not refuted. That treatise, following other schools' intention, describes manifest six causes. Now indicating this meaning, hence saying "all are dominant conditions."

From "*Abhidharma* fourth" to "establishing the other five causes": That treatise's fourth, explaining causal condition characteristics, says: "Also due to self-nature, due to differences, due to companions, due to equal activity, due to enhancement, due to obstruction, due to support - these are causal condition characteristics." Up to saying "self-nature" refers to productive cause's self-nature. Depending on cause's self-nature, establishing productive cause, therefore know: all causes are included in productive cause. To manifest difference meanings, again separately establishing companion and other causes. Explaining: the reason for naming productive cause as "self-nature" is because depending on cause-essence having function to produce results. Regarding cause-essence, establishing productive cause. Question: If taking cause's ability to produce results as naming it productive cause, then all causes produce results - all causes should be included in productive [cause]. How can there additionally be the other five? To answer this question, hence saying "know that all causes are included in productive [cause]." To manifest that productive cause has many differences, outside productive cause, additionally establishing the five of companions, etc. What the other five don't include all enters the initial productive cause's inclusion. Hence outside the five causes, separately having productive cause - this is self-nature, extending to six causes' essences. That productive also extends to the latter five. Speaking of "differences

etc." explains the second phrase. Because productive is broad and universal, hence pervading all causes. Within productive [cause], having companions and other superior powers, when name-essence characteristics are manifest, five causes should be established. The other five's inclusions all return to productive, hence within productive [cause] there are still many dharmas, hence saying "differences." Within productive [cause] there are twenty types of differential meanings, as extensively explained in treatises - [I] temporarily stop due to complexity.

From "if depending on causal conditions" to "because not causal conditions": *She Dacheng Lun*, *Weishi*, etc. explain seeds facing manifestations, etc. Examining the two treatises' originals, there's no text about seeds facing manifestations becoming productive, simultaneous, corresponding, universal, etc. Now taking the meaning and pointing to texts, hence saying "explains." *She [Dacheng] Lun* second, *Weishi* second both say: Ālayavijñāna and defiled dharmas mutually serve as causal conditions, like wick and flame successively arising and burning, also like bundled reeds mutually depending and abiding. Only depending on these two, establishing causal conditions. Other causal conditions cannot be obtained. Up to Wuxing's commentary saying: If explaining the five causes as causal conditions, this differently explains Ālayavijñāna. The three causes of similar-type, universal, and retribution - if separated from sustaining-perfuming cause-nature, don't correspond. Up to the two causes of corresponding and simultaneous, as extensively explained there. Explaining: mutually serving as causal conditions - Kuo says: traditionally transmitted, the meaning of mutual causation has five different explanations. However, correct doctrine says: old seeds producing manifestations are simultaneous and simultaneous causes. Manifestations facing old seeds are simultaneous but not causes. This manifestation newly perfuming-accomplishing seeds are simultaneous and simultaneous causes. New seeds facing manifestations are simultaneous but not causes. Though seeds have new-old differences, if regarding moments

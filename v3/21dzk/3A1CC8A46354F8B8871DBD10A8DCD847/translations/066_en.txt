The reason Śāriputra retreated was that when he offered his eye, the recipient disliked its smell and trampled and crushed it with his foot. Thereupon he immediately retreated and aroused the śrāvaka mind. This is extensively explained as in that sūtra.

"Question: What kind of name... also called eliminating bonds": This raises a question based on *Yogācārabhūmi* volume 58. That text says: "Question: When various practitioners eliminate afflictions, do they abandon bonds or abandon latent tendencies? By eliminating what is it called elimination? Answer: They only abandon latent tendencies, because affliction bonds have already been abandoned previously" up to extensive explanation. Bonds and latent tendencies ultimately do not arise. However, this chapter's text says "fifty-nine," but the character "nine" is probably an error. "Affliction bonds already abandoned previously" means: the preparatory path subdues bonds, the uninterrupted path eliminates seeds. Hence it says "bonds already abandoned previously." If one only eliminates latent tendencies, bonds then do not arise, hence it says "ultimately do not arise, also called eliminating bonds."

"This explains the noble path... explaining it as elimination": The above are all treatise texts; this is precisely the chapter master's text. That the noble path correctly eliminates latent tendencies means: broadly explaining the meaning of elimination, there are generally two types. First, eliminating seeds etc. to make them permanently without remainder. Second, merely suppressing to make seed power decline and not generate present delusions. If eliminating seeds, only uncontaminated wisdom [can do this]. If making power decline, both contaminated and uncontaminated wisdoms can achieve [this]. Now this only explains the meaning of using uncontaminated wisdom to eliminate seeds. If [one objects that] seeds cannot be simultaneous with the path, how can it be called eliminating seeds? Though also not simultaneous with the path, concerning the before-and-after continuity of one body, through the power of cultivating the noble path, making the fundamental consciousness etc. separate from latent tendencies in all three times, hence it is explained as eliminating seeds of the three times. These various meanings

have already been explained previously. Hence it says "as previously explained meanings, explaining it as elimination."

"Question: Three minds true... because of coarse two minds": This is the fourth question, which the chapter master himself raises. This question's intention also manifests [the following]: If the three-mind seeing path is [taken as] true seeing, dharma-emptiness observation is subtle and necessarily includes person-emptiness. If so, the second mind should also simultaneously eliminate person-attachment. That is, person-attachment is eliminated in three minds, while dharma-attachment is eliminated only in two minds? Subtle dharma observation should be eliminated within three minds, while coarse person-emptiness observation is eliminated in two minds.

"Answer: Though dharma observation... otherwise violates the treatise": This answer's intention manifests [the following]: Though dharma observation is subtle and necessarily includes person-emptiness, the second mind does not eliminate person-attachment. Like dharma observation eliminating delusions in the ten grounds - though eliminating affliction habits, it does not remove latent tendencies. Because it is not a proper obstacle to the ten grounds path, [it] does not seek [to eliminate it] during preparatory mind time. The *Kuiji* commentary says: "The ten grounds are still like this, because of intentional retention. Seeing delusions are not like this. How do [they] not eliminate?" [One] should answer: Though the second mind includes person observation, because it follows other power, though arising it does not eliminate person-attachment. If it eliminated person-attachment, [it] should also be called "residual emotion." If so, the three minds should have no distinctions. Hence each eliminates in two grades. [There is] no violation of principle and teaching. This precisely dislikes the chapter master's intention. Hence now rescuing, [it] says: If the person observation carried by the second mind does not eliminate person-attachment because it follows other power, then the carried person observation in the third mind also should not eliminate person-attachment because it arises following others. By this reasoning, [one] should accord with deep principle like the chapter master. "Both eliminating in two grades" etc. means: person and dharma attachments are eliminated in parallel two grades.

first and third eliminate person-attachment, the second and third eliminate dharma-attachment, hence it says "both eliminating in two grades." *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-five says: "The first mind eliminates inferior person-attachment, the second mind eliminates inferior dharma-attachment, the third mind simultaneously eliminates superior [grades of] both attachments." If [one] does not speak of "two grades," then [it] violates this treatise. Hence it says "otherwise violates the treatise." Question: The third mind is precisely the liberation path. How can [it] be explained that this can eliminate everything? Explanation: Elimination has three meanings. First, called elimination because of suppression - this is the preparatory path. Second, called elimination because of correct elimination - this is the uninterrupted path. Third, called elimination because of prevention - this is the liberation path. Preventing future types of the previous two grades, making [them] never arise, hence explaining [it] as capable of eliminating all coarse heaviness.

"Question: Is it total condition... capable of eliminating afflictions": This raises a question based on the *Abhidharmasamuccaya* etc. This question's intention manifests [the following]: This so-called elimination - is it capable of eliminating through total-condition wisdom, or capable of eliminating through particular-condition wisdom? What fault is there in this? If total-condition wisdom can eliminate, total-condition wisdom is not self-characteristic wisdom. How can shared-characteristic inferential wisdom be capable of eliminating delusions? If particular-characteristic wisdom can eliminate, then [it] violates the *Abhidharmasamuccaya* and fifty-nine etc. texts. Hence *Abhidharmasamuccaya* seventh [volume] etc. says: "Question: What kind of mental attention can eliminate? Answer: Through total-condition mental attention observing all dharmas as having no self-nature, [one] can eliminate afflictions." Siṃhābodhi says: "Total-condition mental attention means making [one] condition all dharmas, shared-characteristic mental attention." The *Kuiji* commentary says: "Fifty-nine says 'Only through total-condition mental attention can [one] eliminate afflictions' - if so, observing true self-characteristics should

not eliminate delusions." The meaning is also the same as this.

"Answer: *Buddhabhūmi* treatise... because of self and shared characteristics": Like the explanation in *Buddhabhūmi* treatise volume six: "How can Buddha know shared characteristics? Since shared characteristics are established depending on inference, could Buddha's knowing shared characteristics be inference?" There are three explanations there. This is the first explanation. "Though this master says..." below is the chapter master's text. This master's intention says: The *Pramāṇasamuccaya*'s explanation of the two valid cognitions of direct perception and inference are in scattered mind states, established depending on self and shared characteristics. [It] does not explain being in concentrated states. If in concentrated mind, conditioning all characteristics are all included in direct perception. Through this, total-condition wisdom is also included in direct perception, hence eliminating delusions has no fault. Precisely because concentration illuminates the essence of shared characteristics, [it] explains concentrated mind as direct perception. The *Kuiji* commentary says: "If depending on this explanation, having already permitted concentrated mind to universally condition self and shared [characteristics], only [that which] conditions shared [characteristics] can eliminate afflictions. Emptiness and no-self observation observes shared characteristics." The meaning is also the same as this. However, regarding emptiness and no-self observation, there is total and particular. However, what the first master takes has not yet been detailed. It is difficult to determine by analogy.

"The second master says... not shared characteristics": This is entirely treatise text. "Concentrated mind only conditions self-characteristics" etc. means: All concentrated minds only condition self-characteristics, all being direct perception, naturally having knowable self-characteristics. However, being led by shared-characteristic expedient means, conditioning various shared characteristics and manifesting self-characteristic principles - concerning expedient means [it] explains and names [this] "knowing shared characteristics." If not thus concerning expedient means explaining conditioned objects, [it is] named knowing self-characteristics. Also, the Tathāgata has no non-concentrated mind, only knowing self-characteristics. This is because [it] is direct perception. Through this, the two emptinesses' capability to designate suchness as expedient principle, sometimes explaining suchness

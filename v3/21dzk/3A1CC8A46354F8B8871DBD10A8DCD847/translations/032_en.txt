That is, the collar of clothing. In phonetics it is also the character "jin" (襟). "Eryi" (而已) means "er" (耳, only). Du Yu said "er is a grammatical particle." The pronunciation of "yun" (允) is hou-min-fan. It means trustworthy, accomplished.

"How can we know... not called real truth": The meaning of this question says: How can we know that the two-emptiness suchness revealed through the designating approaches of what can be burned, cut, etc., when formed against the one real suchness without burning, cutting, etc., belongs to the ultimate meaning of ultimate meaning? "What is called real truth is named true dharma, etc." - this uses seven meanings to explain the meaning of real truth: 1) true reality, 2) non-inverted, 3) non-false, 4) called Mahāyāna, 5) spoken by Buddha, 6) one pure path, 7) having permanence, bliss, self, and purity. Due to these meanings it is called real truth. This explains the first meaning.

"Good son, reality... because it is most excellent": This explains the latter six meanings, which can be understood in sequence. "Taking suchness without burning, cutting, etc. as truth" means the one real suchness. Truth means reality. Because it is only the inner realization of sages, it is called ultimate meaning.

"Mañjuśrī... no difference": This is Mañjuśrī's challenge. Among the previous seven meanings, he challenges each in sequence. In this text, he first raises one challenge, saying: If reality is taken as real truth, and reality is namely Tathāgata, space, and Buddha-nature, then if these three are equally called real truth, these three dharmas should have no differences. This will be understood below.

"Buddha told Mañjuśrī... not truth but reality": This is the general answer. Among the Four Noble Truths, each has three levels: "having suffering" refers to the matter of the truth of suffering; "having truth" refers to the principle of suffering; "having reality" refers to

the suchness of the nature of the truth of suffering. The other three truths should be understood accordingly.

"Mañjuśrī... also thus": This provides explanation by quotation. Following sequence, it explains the meaning of the Four Truths. In this text, it first raises the truth of suffering and abbreviates the other three truths. "What is called suffering" is quotation. "Due to the characteristic of impermanence" is explanation. Because of impermanence there is suffering. "This is the characteristic of what can be eliminated" - the contaminated can be eliminated. Because the cause of accumulation is eliminated, the fruit of suffering is accordingly eliminated. This is the provisional characteristic in the conventional. Like knowing conventional objects, this is made real truth. "The nature of Tathāgata" - this ultimate truth, because it is the truth of Tathāgata, is called Tathāgata-nature. This nature lacks the characteristic of oppression, therefore it is not suffering. Lacking the characteristic of flux, it is not impermanent. Lacking the characteristic of what can be eliminated, it is not the characteristic of what can be eliminated. It is the place where characteristics are eliminated. This is made real truth. "Space and Buddha-nature are also thus" - this can be understood by analogy. Because they are free from the three characteristics.

"The meaning of this sūtra text... only belongs to reality": "What is in bondage is called Buddha-nature, etc." - one real suchness has three names according to position: first, what is in bondage is called Buddha-nature; second, what is in the fruit is called Tathāgata, also called Dharmakāya; third, what pervades both positions is called space. This is explained from what reveals, not from essential emptiness. Question: Is emptiness the same? Is wisdom the same as emptiness? Is emptiness different from wisdom? Explanation: Emptiness is the object of wisdom. The essence of emptiness is not wisdom. When wisdom knows that emptiness, it reveals this suchness. Therefore this sūtra's meaning, based on abandoning designation and discussing the purport of the one true dharma realm, establishes these three names. Question: These three names are all designating approaches. Depending on what designation reveals, this is the third truth. How can it now say "Tathāgata, space, Buddha-nature are all the fourth truth"? Explanation: Raising designation to take the purport. If designation is not raised, how can wisdom arise? Now since we are discussing the purport instead, it is the fourth truth. This meaning should be contemplated. Question: Suffering, accumulation, cessation, path are the matters of the Four Truths. Then excluding cessation, the other three, being conditioned, can be called matters. Cessation truth is unconditioned - how can it be called matter? Explanation: Buddha's explanation of cessation truth is like gardens, like forests, like the other shore, etc. This is called the matter of cessation. As explained in Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā fascicle 77. "Truth namely four principles" refers to the principles of cause and effect. "Four suchnesses" refers to the suchness of four natures.

"Also as previously stated... also has differences": The general meaning of this text is that the Four Truths are established approaches, while the one truth is non-established. Therefore the Nirvāṇa [Sūtra] explains it as "neither suffering nor truth," but only belongs to reality. To prove this meaning, various texts are now quoted to explain the meaning of non-establishment. Yogācāra fascicle 64 and Xianzang fascicle 6 say: "Non-established reality refers to the true suchness real nature of all dharmas." Among truths, the first three are the same as the latter three conventional [truths], which is why they are not explained. Also, regarding the difference between differentiation and non-differentiation, it explains "truth is only one." Speaking in terms of principle and reality, truth can also be four. In Vijñāpti-mātra Treatise fascicle 9, the four truths are complete. Showing superiority over conventional [truth], it also shows there are differences. Therefore truth is also four. Extensively as explained there.

"Śrīmālā's one truth... meaning refers to the noble path": The meaning of the Śrīmālā Sūtra is that among the Four Noble Truths, three are impermanent and one is permanent. Based on the fourth truth, it explains the meaning of cessation truth. Therefore that sūtra's One Truth chapter says: "Cessation truth is free from conditioned characteristics. What is free from conditioned characteristics is permanent. What is permanent is not false dharma. What is not false is truth. This is permanent, this is refuge. Therefore cessation truth is ultimate meaning." "The two truths of the Benevolent King each belong to their own categories" means if conventional, it belongs to worldly truth; if ultimate, it belongs to

ultimate meaning truth. "First is provisional conventional, etc." - the Madhyāntavibhāga Treatise fascicle 2 explains that conventional and ultimate meaning each have three types. Namely, the imagined nature among the three natures, originally lacking essence and having only nominal designation, is called provisional conventional. The dependent nature, when the meaning of flux predominates, is called active conventional. The third conventional, because it is revealed through the second conventional, is also called conventional, though its essence is also not real. "Meaning-ultimate meaning" - the uncontaminated contemplative mind is called superior wisdom. Since suchness is its object, it is called ultimate meaning. Since meaning is object, to distinguish it from the latter two ultimate meanings, it is called meaning-ultimate meaning. What is now called "meaning" is namely benefit, because it can accord and benefit. Since this nirvāṇa's essence is superior fruit, it establishes the name "superior." Also because it is benefit, it is also called meaning. "Active ultimate meaning" - wisdom is conditioned, therefore called active. Taking superior dharma as meaning, it is called ultimate meaning. Extensively as explained in that treatise and commentary.

"This section's conventional... easy to understand": Below this, the three truths and three conventional [truths] explained in treatises like Madhyāntavibhāga are compared with the four-level two truths explained here for mutual inclusion. "Provisional worldly truth" - actually lacking essential nature to be called conventional, having only its name, it is provisionally called conventional. It belongs to the first conventional among the four conventional [truths]. The second essence is conditioned activity. Since its essence is properly conventional, to distinguish ultimate truth that is also conventional, it is called active. Therefore the old Madhyāntavibhāga calls it "grasping active conventional." Being only conditioned dependent [nature], among the four conventional [truths] it belongs to the second and

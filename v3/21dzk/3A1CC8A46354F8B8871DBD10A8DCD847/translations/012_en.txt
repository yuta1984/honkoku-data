The five vehicles are each different. To guide one category of beings, therefore the One Vehicle is taught. It is not that there is only one vehicle without two, three, etc. However, teaching one or teaching two etc. all have meanings of expedient means and ultimate truth.

In teaching one, if concealing two etc. and teaching only one, this is expedient teaching, like the latter eight meanings among the ten causes. If teaching one without concealing two, this is ultimate teaching, like the first two meanings among the ten causes. Therefore the Mahāyānasaṃgraha says: "The first two cause verses are taught with definitive meaning, the latter eight cause verses are taught with hidden meaning." The reason for this is that the first two distinguish capacities and do not conceal two. The latter eight do not distinguish but broadly extend to others. That the first two distinguish capacities as definitive teaching means: the capacities being guided reach fruit that is only the one Buddha Vehicle, without other two or three. By this, the words teaching One Vehicle are as they explain, with no confusion in meaning. Therefore it says "the first two distinguish capacities as definitive teaching." Teaching the teachings of two etc. should also be understood likewise. Teaching one and teaching two etc. already has two paths. If one becomes attached to either, none accords with principle. To manifest this meaning, it says "vehicles are not only one without two, three, etc."

Regarding the text "The Lotus Treatise says... not the other two types." From here below, texts are cited to prove the above meaning. According to the Lotus Treatise, since Buddha does not give predictions to those heading for extinction, it is clearly known that vehicles are not only one without two, three, etc. However, examining the treatise text, it says "determinate śrāvakas," not "extinction-bound." To show that "determinate" is an alternate name for "extinction-bound," one name is mentioned accordingly. The Commentary says that the extinction-bound śrāvakas explained in Yogācāra and the determinate śrāvakas of the Lotus Treatise have completely different natures.

The reason for this is that there are two types of determinate. First is ultimately determinate. Originally having only śrāvaka nature, being śrāvaka nature, they permanently have no meaning of transcending to the Great Vehicle. This is the extinction-bound explained in Yogācāra. Second is temporarily determinate. Because their faculties are immature in one teaching period, they cannot turn toward [the Great Vehicle], so they are called determinate. It is not that they ultimately do not turn in later times. This is the determinate explained in the Lotus Treatise. Because the treatise explains generating great aspiration in later times. One should know that the meanings of extinction-bound and determinate in the two treatises are each different. The present interpretation is not so. Since the treatise text already says "to transform those who retreat and emanations, therefore the World-Honored One gives predictions, not to the other two types." The text is already clear. How can one rashly determine with emotion? Therefore extinction-bound and determinate are both two vehicles without Buddha-nature.

Regarding the text "Emanation śrāvakas... this is exactly it." From here below explains that for the two people - emanations and those who retreat - Buddha gives predictions. "That is, what the sūtra explains" etc. is text from the General Chapter of the ninth volume of the ten-volume Laṅkāvatāra. The Commentary says that those intoxicated with samādhi explained in Laṅkāvatāra are the same as the determinate explained in the Lotus Treatise. Because they cannot turn through Buddha's one teaching, they head toward the thought of extinction and dwell in cessation concentration. Though they cannot yet attain transformational birth-and-death, because they are sustained by the power of concentration, their supporting bodies dwell in nirvāṇa through many eons. The explanation that stream-enterers reach [Buddhahood] after eighty thousand eons etc. should also be the same as this - this is incorrect. Regarding those intoxicated with samādhi explained in Laṅkāvatāra, broadly observing the sūtra text, it seems to explain actual bodies. However, examining that sūtra, the Transformation Chapter of the eighth volume says: "Mahāmati, in this world and other buddha-lands, there are sentient beings who practice bodhisattva conduct yet also delight in

śrāvaka dharma practice. To turn them toward attaining great bodhi, emanation buddhas become emanation śrāvakas and give predictions. It is not that reward buddhas or dharma-body buddhas give predictions. Since it says emanation buddhas give predictions for emanation śrāvakas, it is clearly known that those intoxicated with samādhi extend to both transformation and actual. The chapter master's present intention uses the meaning of general transformation to cite sūtra texts, so it does not contradict the sūtra. Therefore teaching One Vehicle for emanations etc." - what follows is the chapter master's text.

Regarding the text "Śāriputra etc... five various natures." That they "first generated great aspiration" etc. means that at the place of twenty billion buddhas in the past, serving as good friends, they constantly taught the Great Vehicle transformation. Śāriputra at that time also accordingly received teachings, therefore he first generated great aspiration. Examining the Upāsaka Precepts Sūtra, it says: "Śāriputra once for sixty eons practiced the bodhisattva path. A brahmin requested his eye from him. Śāriputra gave it. After obtaining and observing it, [the brahmin] threw it on the ground, trampled it with both feet, reviled [Śāriputra] and left. Śāriputra became regretful and remorseful and consequently retreated from great aspiration." Because this explains that time, through giving the eye, he retreated to seek small fruit. Question: As the Fundamental Activities Sūtra says, before the seventh abiding is called the retreating portion. If one does not meet good friends, in one eon or up to ten eons, one retreats from bodhisattva aspiration. Like Prince Pure-Eye, Dharma-Talent King, Śāriputra etc., wanting to enter the seventh abiding, meeting evil friend conditions in the middle, they retreat and enter among ordinary beings' unwholesome evils. Among these two types explaining Śāriputra, some are expedient, some are real. Interpreting with two explanations: First says the Śāriputra explained in the two sūtras is all real, not expedient. However, that the Fundamental Activities says falling into unwholesome evils clarifies the retreating characteristic,

not reality. Second says the Śāriputra in the Upāsaka Sūtra is the same as the Lotus Treatise's retreating from bodhisattva aspiration. Since he receives predictions, therefore he is real. The Śāriputra explained in the Fundamental Activities Sūtra, since it says retreating into unwholesome evils, therefore we know this is expedient. The category of Śāriputra etc. is not only one.

Regarding the text "Also the Nirvāṇa [Sūtra] says... as explained in this." The meaning of this text manifests that teaching One Vehicle is not all definitive meaning. Master Yuan says: One Vehicle means the vehicle practice is one. One Path means the dharma path is one. One Practice is this vehicle. One Condition is the essence of dharma path. Because dharma is the condition for practice, it is called having conditions. Based on the great encompassing the small, being only one, all should become buddhas. Foolish people hear without understanding and immediately say they will definitely become buddhas. When the Tathāgata later explains that stream-enterers etc. attain small nirvāṇa, foolish people don't understand and immediately say two vehicles definitely do not become buddhas. Regarding not becoming [buddhas], one cannot have partial attachment, because sentient beings' natures have distinctions. Master Baosheng says: From here below reconciles the dispute between One Vehicle and Three Vehicles. One Vehicle is the hidden-intention One Vehicle. One Path is like the Saṃdhinirmocana explaining that the three vehicles equally depend on the three natureless having one path etc. One Practice One Condition is the same as Mahāyāna-saṃgraha's non-discriminating activity characteristics - non-discriminating characteristics. This follows the Lotus and Nirvāṇa. There is dispute with previous sūtras, so this preserves three while teaching one. At different times it teaches sameness. It is not wanting to clarify that all three vehicles attain Buddhahood. Like insects eating wood - though this is not understanding writing, though the same as later teachings, because it is not the previous sūtra's meaning, it becomes dispute. The chapter master's present intention is that the One Vehicle explained in various sūtras before and after is not wanting to clarify that all three vehicles attain Buddhahood. Through the ten intentions, generally

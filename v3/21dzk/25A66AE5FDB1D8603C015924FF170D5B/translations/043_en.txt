"Question: Real cognition of body-faculty etc." - the marginal commentary says: This question and answer speaks about non-theists [etc.].

The question's intention is: non-theists consider that words obtain fire's self-characteristics, and real cognition relating to these words can also obtain fire's self-characteristics. Like body-faculty touching fire. Therefore this question arises. Regarding equally obtaining self-characteristics, since their extent is already equal, why does it burn the body but not burn cognition [meaning]? Regarding the answer's intention, the marginal commentary says: If fire opposes mind, its function is most weak. If opposing faculties, its function is strong. Therefore there is burning of faculties but not burning of mind. This is the non-theists' answer [etc.]. Therefore, to show the extent of non-theists' understanding, there is this question and answer.

"Answer: These universal characteristics [...] universal characteristics as foundation" - the Continued Commentary says: Answer: The self-characteristics that direct perception obtains through relating can be distinguished as having substance. It also relates to dharmas having substance. Because it harms the self-substance. If inference relates to both particular and universal types of subject and predicate, relating to the three characteristics of reasons, these universal characteristics ○ [below as in the main commentary, etc.]

"Even if concentrated mind relates through those conventional expressions etc." - Dō says: Concentrated mind seeking names and relating to fire, according to Consciousness-Only, is included in universal characteristics. Because this can be spoken. If according to Hetuvidyā, it is included in self-characteristics. Because each relates by thanking its own substance [etc.]. The marginal commentary says: Bei says: Based on this text, it is clearly known. Concentrated mind seeking names and relating to fire is already universal characteristics and also self-characteristics [etc.].

"However, not permitting names ○ therefore saying obtaining self-characteristics" - Dō says: Hetuvidyā's self-characteristics [etc.]. "These universal characteristics" - Dō says: Hetuvidyā's universal characteristics [etc.].

"Same as conventional expressions indicating foundational universal characteristics" - the marginal commentary says: Hetuvidyā's universal characteristics are the same as Consciousness-Only's universal

characteristics. Foundation means because it is the foundation of what indicates [etc.].

The Mingdeng Commentary says: According to the Buddhabhūmi-śāstra, Hetuvidyā's two characteristics are not the same as the sūtras. Hetuvidyā's intention is: all dharmas' real meaning is called self-characteristics. Also, scattered mind's discrimination and provisional establishment is called universal characteristics. What the sūtras explain as universal characteristics is included in self-characteristics within Hetuvidyā treatises. The reason for this is: regarding dharmas, self-characteristics and universal characteristics each attach to their own substance, not shared with others. Because they are not provisional establishments, they are called real meaning. Not waiting for provisional cognition's discriminative establishment, following dharma-nature's principle, following self-nature, therefore called self-characteristics. That is, the realm of direct perception mind. Suffering, impermanence etc. - their substance-nature is not non-existent, pervading all dharmas, commonly possessed by all dharmas, therefore the Buddhabhūmi-śāstra calls them universal characteristics. If the universal characteristics explained in Hetuvidyā are only superimposed provisional establishments on self-characteristics. Same names but different meanings. Therefore with the sūtra's intention, the meaning does not contradict.

○ Why now say "these universal characteristics completely lack substance"? Explaining: Universal characteristics are merely conventional expressions' superimposed provisional establishments. It is not that universal characteristics' substance exists apart from self-characteristics. That is, though provisional cognition indicates, it does not obtain self-characteristics. However, because there is no way to establish apart from self-characteristics, in response to conventional expressions and discriminative cognition, they superimpose and establish on dharmas' self-characteristics. Having no separate self-substance, this is called provisional. Blocking obtaining self-characteristics, explaining self-characteristics, explaining universal characteristics' names. Therefore, though explaining "what names obtain are not real dharmas," Consciousness-Only also says "because of this, they only operate depending on seeming things." Seeming means superimposition - not actually existing characteristics. Buddhabhūmi also says "like the universal characteristics explained in Hetuvidyā treatises are necessarily scattered mind's discriminative provisional establishments." Based on these texts, universal characteristics lack substance. Therefore saying "these universal characteristics completely lack substance." The text "Even if concentrated mind relates

therefore also reaching no error" ○ This is because it creates understanding based on names, therefore relating [investigation: the character for "relating" is unclear, possibly repeated] - this is provisional cognition called obtaining self-characteristics. Also called direct perception because it is not the same as inference's discriminative provisional establishment calculating that names and meanings are definitely mutually attached ○ "Same as conventional expressions indicating foundational universal characteristics" - the superimpositions taken by provisional cognition and indication are called foundations. What is this meaning? Depending on beginningless internal mental calculation, on ineffable dharmas, discriminatively superimposing, then producing conventional expressions. Depending on these conventional expressions, further producing provisional cognition. Their superimposed language pervades here and there, therefore called universal characteristics. These universal characteristics are the foundational places where names and sentences arise. Because foundation is immediately universal, called foundational universal characteristics etc. [etc.].

[Indented one character]
Therefore, following these explanations, considering the two teachings' two characteristics having or lacking substance: Hetuvidyā's universal characteristics are substanceless provisional ones. Hetuvidyā's self-characteristics are immediately esoteric teaching's universal characteristics - these are substantial provisional ones. Esoteric teaching's self-characteristics are truly substantial. Because they are immediately dharma-nature. These are immediately true direct perception's realm. Is it like this?

"If (also saying) Buddha-mind relates to inference's universal characteristics etc." - the Mingdeng Commentary says: Regarding Buddha relating to universal characteristics, there are immediately two explanations. One says: Causal stage direct perception is inferior, only able to relate to self-characteristics. If relating to universal characteristics, this is included in inference. Fruition stage is already omniscient, also able to relate to universal characteristics. However, through non-discrimination, it is still included in direct perception. Calling the ability to relate to universal characteristics "inference" only speaks about causal stage scattered mind. One says: Buddhabhūmi-śāstra objects to "universal characteristics explained in Hetuvidyā treatises are necessarily scattered mind's discriminative provisional establishments." Since Tathāgatas already lack inference's scattered mind, how do Buddhas relate to universal characteristics? ○ Now this commentary master follows the first explanation [etc.].

The marginal commentary says: Yup says: This explains Buddha-mind relating to universal characteristics that are inference's objects. It does not mean Buddha-mind has inference [text].

Also says: Bei says: Buddha relating to ordinary beings' inferential mind's object universal characteristics is also substanceless [etc.].

"Therefore Nyāyamukha says [...] then becomes direct perception" - this explains the treatise text [because the present treatise has words like "having etc.", completely same as Nyāyamukha] greatly having two meanings [seen].

[Indented three characters]
First Explanation

[Indented one character]
Far from all types [Vaiśeṣika's great existence, sameness-difference, Sāṃkhya's three qualities etc.'s discriminations], conventional provisional establishments [calling short "long" etc., all not according to reality, conventional discriminations], non-difference [discriminations operating based on universal characteristics], various approaches [discriminations of permanence, impermanence etc. among the six categories] discriminations.

[Indented three characters]
This explanation generally eliminates inferential and invalid cognition discriminations [meaning].

Second Explanation

[Indented one character]
Far from all types of [because conventional expressions are not one, called types] conventionally established non-difference [depending on these conventional expressions, provisionally establishing one dharma, pervading all dharmas, called non-difference] various approaches [calling interpenetrating schools, definitely existent, different-pervading, non-existent etc. "various approaches"] discriminations.

[Indented three characters]
This explanation only eliminates inferential discriminations [meaning]. Or possibly "various approaches being various non-theists etc." - this is one meaning explaining the words "various approaches" in this explanation [seen as such].

"This immediately does not eliminate completely" - this explanation does not eliminate invalid cognition discriminations. Therefore elimination is incomplete [meaning].

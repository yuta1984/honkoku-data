is the cause. The cognition of the produced fire is the manifest result. Understanding what is constructed is the inferential cause. The cognition understanding the thesis is the inferential result.
[See Collected Records] "Yogācāra and Prakaraṇa... do not separately establish" explains that because Yogācāra and Prakaraṇa do not establish same-class and different-class separately, and also do not establish combination-conclusion. "Abhidharma and Asaṅga... thereby eight" explains that because Abhidharma does not establish same-different separately, and also establishes combination-conclusion. "Following the previous master" means revealing as a cause that Asaṅga followed Maitreya in making eight the means of proof. "General and particular of cause": simply saying "verbal cause" is general; the three characteristics of cause are particular. "General and particular of example": simply saying "establishing example" is general; same and different are particular. "Since separate examples are already deficient, combination-conclusion is added" means that separating examples into two matters has already deficient reasoning. Therefore making examples one and adding combination-conclusion. "Although combination-conclusion is separate from cause-example" and following addresses hidden difficulties and determines the principle that combination-conclusion should be established. "In examples there is no combination... therefore generally abbreviated" - according to Myōtō Commentary: This explains why combination-conclusion as two members are not established in Abhidharma treatise. No-combination and inverted-combination are faults within examples. In principle, combination-conclusion could be established following that pattern. But separated from cause-example there is no superior essence, therefore not explained. Simply explaining cause first with examples following, etc. explains why conclusion-member is not established. Collected Records says: Ying says this means Vasubandhu criticizes Abhidharma for establishing combination-member. Because combination's meaning is not clearly manifest. In example-faults this is established as example-fault. However in genuine means of proof, combination-conclusion do not separate from cause-example. Therefore combination-conclusion members are not additionally established. Saying "analogical establishment" means analogical conclusion [a certain commentary agrees]. Later records say: "In examples there is no combination... therefore explained as fault" - this text is concessive. "Separated from cause and example, entirely without superior essence" and following is called

deprivation.

"The three of direct perception, etc." refers to direct perception, inference, and scriptural authority.

"After Chen-na there are briefly three interpretations, etc." - according to Myōtō Commentary: Among these three interpretations, the first is expression-expressed correspondence, also called word-meaning correspondence. The second is total-aggregate partial correspondence, also called general-particular correspondence. The third is dependent-support correspondence, also called combination-separation correspondence.

A certain record says: "Dependent combination-thesis" means inseparable nature is called combination-thesis. This very combination-thesis is called dependent. This interpretation is incorrect. Ancient masters had not yet established the name "inseparable." How could inseparable be called combination-thesis? Therefore know it is incorrect. Who transmitted these three interpretations? The first interpretation was transmitted by Master Jōshō [requires re-examination]. The second interpretation was transmitted by Master Bunki. The third interpretation was transmitted by Daijō-ki. For the first two transmissions, see their respective commentaries. The third transmission is precisely this text. In the first interpretation, "that [treatise] explains in the treatise, etc." - Collected Records says: Yup says this proves that words expressing the thesis are also what-is-to-be-established. Question: That treatise only says "Why establish the thesis first? In order to first reveal the thesis-doctrine one loves." It does not say thesis-words are also what-is-to-be-established. How does this serve as proof? Answer: Since it says "reveal the thesis-doctrine one loves," therefore know this is precisely words expressing the thesis. Since it says "Why establish the thesis first?" therefore know thesis-words can become what-is-to-be-established. That treatise also asks "Why next explain the cause?" Also asks "Why next cite examples?" Since cause-example, etc. all do not use the word "establish," only regarding that thesis alone is it called "establish." Through this therefore know that words expressing

the thesis can be called what-is-to-be-established. Now according to the meaning of capability-to-establish, it is explained as means-of-proof.

[Indented one character]
My private reading of the text says: "Although also what-is-to-be-established, explaining that in the treatise, why establish the thesis first? Because one loves the thesis-doctrine. Although also what-is-to-be-established, it is not definitely what-is-to-be-established. Because it has the capability to establish meaning." The meaning is that "Why establish the thesis-doctrine first?" [○ is probably the character "者"] is text from the Yogācāra treatise. That is, citing text that makes thesis the means-of-proof. Why? Since it says that stating the thesis before cause-example is to first reveal the thesis-doctrine one loves. Clearly know that thesis-words are themselves means-of-proof, their meaning is what-is-to-be-established. Therefore this text is cited. The current general meaning says: Because thesis-words are established by cause-example, although also what-is-to-be-established, Yogācāra explains them as means-of-proof [this foolish inference should especially be considered].

The general meaning of the second interpretation: First, regarding the five aggregates, the total aggregate's self-nature and particulars of doctrinal principle are correspondingly what-is-to-be-established. Within this totality, one part stated in opposition to opponents - sound-impermanence, etc. - whether words or meaning, both are means-of-proof. Regarding this there are doubts. As in Collected Records, etc. This should be examined.

"Various treatises only... immediately revealing their faults" - "various treatises" according to ancient notes: Śataśāstra and Ratnakaraṇḍaka. Question: What is the meaning of fault-revealing refutation? It should be called revealing-established-faults refutation. Answer: "Opponent faults" means faults examined by the opponent [meaning]. It is not that the opponent has faults. Question: What is the meaning of "establishing syllogisms immediately reveals their faults"? Answer: Syllogistic refutation is also immediately fault-revealing refutation. Various treatises cite the broad fault-revealing refutation [meaning]. That is, fault-revealing refutation is broad - all means-of-refutation reveal others' faults. Syllogistic refutation is narrow - within that revealing others' faults, it is one part of establishing syllogisms to reveal faults. However, constantly saying "fault-revealing refutation" excludes that one part of syllogistic establishment, referring to the remainder like non-establishment, indefiniteness, etc.

"Lacking one, there are eight; lacking two, there are twenty-eight; up to lacking seven, there are eight; lacking eight, there is one" - lacking one, there are eight; [up to] lacking seven, there are eight; lacking eight, there is one. Easy to understand. Now "lacking two, there are twenty-eight" means: first taking thesis as head, opposing the remaining seven, combining each one-by-one to form one sentence each. That is, thesis-cause lacking, thesis-example lacking, etc. The remainder can be known by analogy. Therefore with thesis as head, there are immediately seven sentences. Likewise, next taking cause as head, opposing the remaining six below, there are immediately six sentences. Next taking example as head, opposing the five below, there are five sentences. Likewise with same[-class] as head there are four sentences, with different[-class] as head there are three sentences, with direct [perception] as head there are two sentences, with inference as head there is one sentence, with scriptural [authority] as head there are

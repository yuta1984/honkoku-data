"Negation etc." presents the fault of violating reason. The thesis and reason fully take negation-affirmation. The example only takes negation. This would violate logical error. Because the three - thesis, reason, and example - all have meaning, they must possess negation-affirmation. "Or it may violate that" etc. presents the fault of violating teaching. In Akṣapāda's original Hetuvidyā treatise, the three - thesis, reason, and example - must possess negation-affirmation. This is regarding having meaning. If they are meaningless dharmas, they should be complete according to circumstances. Since worldly outsiders take Akṣapāda's teaching as definitive inference, it should be called violating teaching [etc.]

Meaningless dharmas are the inferential forms where the three members are merely negative. Meaningful ones are inferences where the three members have negation-affirmation. Now the Sound school's inference against the no-space theory is a negation-affirmation inference. Yet it requires a merely negative example, therefore it becomes a fault. The meaning is as above.

"Questioning all created things" etc. - The Ming Deng Commentary says: The meaning of this question says: When saying "all created things are impermanent," does it only conjoin the created-impermanent on jars etc., or does it also conjoin the created-impermanent on sound? "Not conjoining thesis and reason" means: does it also conjoin the created-impermanent on sound? [etc.]

"Some say not conjoining" etc. - The Ming Deng Commentary says: This is Master Gui's explanation. Therefore his commentary says: The opponent permits the created-ness reason. Because it conjoins with the word "all," it can serve as reason. Others do not establish "sound is impermanent." How does it conjoin with the words "all impermanent"? Though the wording differs slightly, the meaning is the same.

[Lower Section]

Now "not conjoining" (the words "some say not conjoining") means: it only exists in the thesis statement. Because it permits reason-conjunction [etc.] Therefore Wengui's meaning is: the words "all created things" include both the created-ness of jars and the created-ness of sound. The words "all seen as impermanent" only have the impermanence of jars and do not include the impermanence of sound. Therefore this master's meaning is: the conjunction method correctly uses the impermanence of jars to make it belong to the created-ness of jars. Does he think this makes one know that created sound is impermanent?

"Now I say this is not so" etc. - The Ming Deng Commentary says: This is the commentary master refuting Master Gui's explanation. ○ Therefore saying "all created things" immediately encompasses all created things of jars and sound. "All are impermanent" immediately conjoins all impermanence of jars and sound [etc.] Therefore the correct meaning is: the words "all created" also include the created-ness of jars and sound, and the words "all impermanent" also include the impermanence of jars and sound. Thus encompassing and using impermanence to make it belong to created-ness. The meaning that created sound is impermanent is thus established [so to speak].

"Yet speaking inversely saying all impermanent things" etc. below

"Violating one's own doctrine and mutual accordance" etc. - The marginal notes say: Due to inverse conjunction, using impermanence that is not mutually accepted to establish created-ness that is mutually accepted. Since this violates one's own intention, it is called "violating one's own doctrine." Also, since using impermanence to establish created-ness, it is called "mutual accordance" [etc.] Therefore now saying "violating the doctrine" refers to the fault of "establishing what was not originally stated" clarified earlier (middle volume).

"Later questioning pseudo-example faults with pseudo-reasons" etc. - The marginal notes say: Bei says: The meaning of this text says: Are both

non-establishments also probans non-establishment? Down to: is basis non-establishment also probans non-establishment? etc. Also using the 1,458 types of uncertainty faults of pseudo-reasons, when equating them with the 42 pseudo-example faults, the number becomes infinite. "Same" means "meeting" [etc.] Is there an original text that makes the word "question" the character "same"?

"Because of explaining that empty space has permanent nature" etc. below
[End of indent]

"The negative example is merely negative [...] are both not eliminated?" - Regarding saying "there is no both-non-elimination," presenting the method of "no both-non-elimination," why say "there is no" - this is the question. Namely, establishing a merely negative inference saying: "Empty space should not exist, because of being unmade, like rabbit horns." This inference partially negates existence and establishes the meaning of non-existence. Therefore if inversely using existence as the negative example, there would be no fault. But when accordingly using non-existence as the negative example, it commits "no both-non-elimination." That is, taking rabbit horns as the positive example and now using sky-flowers as the negative example. Namely, the separation method says: "All permanently existing things are not non-made, like sky-flowers." When separating like this, nothing is separated at all. Because on sky-flowers there are both non-existence and non-made-ness. This is already a merely negative negative example yet both are not eliminated. Why say "there is no substanceless both-non-elimination"? [so to speak]

"Answer: Previously regarding one thesis [...] therefore not opening two" - The meaning of this answer says: That there is "no lacking both-non-violation" in both-non-elimination discusses this regarding one affirmative inference. That is, the previous both-non-establishment, regarding one thesis, [establishing a negative non-thesis, establishing an affirmative

existence thesis] both prepare existence and non-existence, therefore raising one existence inference opens two faults. The current both-non-elimination, regarding one thesis necessarily has one; regarding separate theses immediately has two. That is, in an existence thesis there is only existence both-non-elimination without non-existence both-non-elimination. This is what the treatise explains. In a non-existence thesis there is only non-existence both-non-elimination without existence both-non-elimination. What is now raised in the question is this. This means in existence, non-existence can constitute the different; in non-existence, existence can constitute the negative example. Therefore in one thesis, existence and non-existence both-non-elimination do not coexist. Thus raising one existence inference only clarifies one both-non-elimination and does not open two. The questioned non-existence both-non-elimination was not originally not permitted [so to speak].

Question: If so, positive examples lacking example-basis constitute a fault, therefore there is lacking both-non-establishment. Negative examples lacking example-basis have no fault, therefore there is no lacking both-non-elimination - this reasoning doesn't hold. Now since it's already permitted that in merely negative cases lacking example-basis in negative examples, there immediately is lacking both-non-elimination.

Answer: That lacking basis in positive examples constitutes a fault means: although the merely negative positive example of negation-affirmation inferences establishes the two positions on the negation side, lacking the affirmed example-basis becomes a fault causing it to fall into lacking both-non-establishment. That negative examples lacking basis have no fault means: the negative example of negation-affirmation inferences, being merely negative, can violate the two positions, and lacking the affirmed example-basis should not become lacking both-non-elimination [so to speak]. Who says that merely negative negative examples from the beginning completely fail to violate the two positions,

There is no lacking both-non-elimination.

[Three character indent]
Merely negative inferences have this. Do merely affirmative inferences lack this? Because affirmation necessarily carries negation. Because negation does not necessarily have affirmation. Therefore, generally there are two types: merely negative inferences and negation-affirmation inferences. [Taking negation as primary while including affirmation, taking affirmation as primary while including negation are also separate.]

Therefore the Nyāyamukha says [...] "Showing the example through the fifth case, knowing the reason through conjunction" - the Continued Commentary says: ○ Knowing the reason through conjunction. This meaning is through the fifth [there may be a character missing after "fifth"] case declension, arising from created-ness. Therefore this is impermanent. Also through "and dependent," like the correct example explanation, showing that in the example the reason is conjoined to make it clear [etc.]

The marginal notes say: The Ximming Commentary says: The first half verse, like the sequence, versifies the positive and negative examples of the preceding prose. The latter half verse versifies the above expedient means. Because it is explained through the fifth case declension, speaking of two examples means: because the conjunctive example method in positive examples serves as expedient means, it reveals the created-ness and other reasons on the subject. Based on this meaning, briefly distinguishing the seven case declensions: 1) explanatory voice; 2) objective case, like saying "cutting wood"; 3) instrumental case, like "person and axe"; 4) purposive case, like saying "cutting wood for kings etc."; 5) ablative case, cutting this wood to build a hall; 6) possessive case, like wood belonging to officials; 7) locative case, like roots depending on farmers' homes etc. Now in explaining the two examples, the ablative case of causative voice is used. Therefore know: these are the positive and negative examples explained through expedient means [etc.] The meaning says: "All created things are seen as impermanent." These words "all" are the cause that makes the created-ness and impermanence on sound

mutually belong. This refers to the conjunction of positive examples. If referring to the separation of negative examples: "All non-permanent things are seen as non-made" [should the character "non" not exist, or should a □ character be added below the inverted "non" character?] The words "all" are what makes permanence and non-made-ness on sound distant and separate. Therefore it says "showing the positive and negative examples by depending on the causative voice of the fifth case declension." Therefore the above text says: "Inversely showing accordance with the words 'all,' definitely conjoining the created-ness on sound with that impermanence, making them belong as cause [etc.]" Cause means causative. [Above from marginal notes]. The above text refers to the above text in the commentary, namely the text "at this place there is no conjunction" below.

"Like explaining the absence of obstructive things" etc. below

"This has two faults, as distinguished in the correct and different" - the marginal notes say: The meaning says: inverse separation has two faults. Namely: 1) establishing what was not originally stated; 2) committing the fault of mutual accordance [etc. The Zhou Record is the same. Inverse conjunction and inverse separation each have these two faults].

"As distinguished in the correct and different" refers to the middle volume.

"Furthermore, for self-awakening, one should know that there are only the two inferences of perception and inference" below
[End of indent]

"Like two lamps and two torches mutually illuminating each other" - the marginal notes say: The meaning says: like two lamps illuminating each other mutually. Also like two torches illuminating each other mutually. In true and pseudo probans there is also self-awakening. In true and pseudo inference there is also awakening others. Yup says: In the two probans and two inferences each have intimate and distant aspects. The text only raises the intimate to show the two distant ones [etc.] Zhou says: Since this lamp casts the shadow of that lamp, that lamp also casts the shadow of this lamp. Torches are also like this. Self-awakening and awakening others, mutual shadows are also thus [etc.]

Torch [torch, bundling firewood, lighting]

"Extensively explaining these two inferences as fully distinguished in the chapter" - I privately say: Examining Cien's Seven-Volume Chapters, there is no two-inference chapter. Zizhou's Supplementary Chapters correctly has a two-inference chapter. Examining this, from "probans non-establishment" onward, both the original and continuation are generally Zizhou's composition. Although this matter is not clear proof, it is taken as embellishment. If according to the doctrine that the original is Cien's composition, then in the Seven-Volume Chapters, although there is no separate doctrinal section, there is the meaning of two inferences. Where two inferences are conveniently explained, this definitely exists. Now pointing to that is therefore not proof. But still examining this is sufficient as proof. Why? If although not a separate doctrinal section, if it merely points to places explaining two inferences, then among the hundred chapter-commentaries composed by Cien, are not the texts merely clarifying the characteristics of perception and inference found everywhere? Why especially point to the chapters? Moreover, if not separate

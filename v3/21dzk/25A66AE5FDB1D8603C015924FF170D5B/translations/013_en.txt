"Cause has three characteristics" below

"Therefore the Reason Door Treatise says: due to enabling function." This quotes the text of the Reason Door Treatise. This is evidence of productive cause. Although it says "not like such," the productive cause characteristic to be blocked can accomplish the present evidence. Therefore it quotes this. "Like a lamp illuminating objects" are the commentary master's private words, explaining the illuminating cause characteristic. Regarding "conforming cause is not effect, namely wisdom-producing cause": Question: What is wisdom-producing cause? It is the establisher's wisdom. This is immediately the two validities of direct perception and inference. However, when direct perception and inference arise, they all have their conditions. Those conditions are causes, and those direct perceptions and inferences are effects. Why say "only cause, not effect"? Answer: This doubt is immediately the meaning of the question in the Bright Lamp Commentary. Explaining this doubt means: the present "only cause, not effect" discusses this in the context of enlightening others. In the context of self-enlightenment, it is like the doubt and does not dispute this. Therefore there is no fault [meaning]. [The commentary should properly be consulted.] Regarding "wisdom-object distant-broad" etc.: The meaning of Collected Records says: The opponent's evidential wisdom is illuminating cause. This wisdom's realm is broad, and the verbal meanings of the other five causes that are effects all become its objects. This realm is immediately the effect. Wisdom as illuminating cause is most distant regarding this effect. It cannot produce and generate that effect. It only illuminates and manifests. Therefore it is named "distant." The words of what-establishes are productive cause. This cause's effect is narrow. It only regards the opponent's evidential wisdom. Yet it is most intimate and can produce and generate that wisdom [meaning]. [Later records and Guangding should be consulted. Now only the meaning is recorded.] Regarding "meaning-words have two functions toward effect" etc.: Establisher-wisdom and opponent-wisdom are each only one. Within one there is no division of productive-illuminating. Therefore regarding the four essences, there is no dispute about becoming those two. Therefore this is temporarily set aside.

[Lower Section]
Now meaning-words each divide productive-illuminating, so among the four essences, relating to those two is difficult. Therefore the present text explains the reason why meaning-words are only two essences, combining the two wisdoms to call them four. Regarding "same-different dharmin are not what-establishes": Question: Taking the two categories of same-different and naming them dharmin is not the usual pattern. What is this meaning? Answer: Generally the form of inference is like establishing a drum, using two things as prior thesis and later example, using one meaning as middle cause. If this is reversed, the example-essence is immediately dharmin. This dharmin is the thing-essence. Examples are separate things. Therefore they obtain the name dharmin.

Regarding "using that total sound" etc.: The present character "sound" has the meaning of "name." Namely this text's meaning says: using that total ○ to burn clothes - although the thesis name is the total name of subject-predicate, this total name also transforms to separate dharmin [meaning]. "If using within thesis [up to] completely having two name-derivations" means: predicate-dharma thesis has the two name-derivations of karmadhāraya and tatpuruṣa. "Now cause name dharma" etc. means: cause-dharma only has the one name-derivation of tatpuruṣa. Regarding "also not using dharma to establish dharmin" etc.: The present dharma is cause. Not using cause to establish dharmin [meaning].

Only due to dharma (▢dharma) [▢: cause?] therefore accomplishing that dharma (predicate dharma) [two character blank] thus accomplishing (▢dharma) [▢: cause?] dharmin

[Indented two characters]
"Thus establishing dharmin" is to include reasoning that disputes essence. Reasoning that disputes meaning should be exhausted in the phrase "only due to dharma therefore accomplishing that dharma."

Regarding "immediately unable to manifest that cause is dharmin-thesis's dharma-nature capable of accomplishing dharma": Question: Although the words "thesis dharma-nature" manifest that cause is dharma-nature above dharmin, they do not extend to manifesting capability of accomplishing predicate dharma. Why explain it thus? Answer: Temporarily, "produced-impermanent" is only dharma-nature above sound. However, manifesting that this one part's produced dharma-nature is dharma-nature above sound-thesis. That this produced meaning accomplishes the present one part impermanent dharma is self-evident. Therefore it is explained thus.

"Like Sarvāstivāda establishing life-faculty against Mahāyāna" etc.: Question: Using this reasoning's cause as evidence of having-separate-essence cause, I cannot grasp the meaning. Although karma and life-faculty are separate, the part now taken as cause does not directly require karma. "Due to having karma" means there is the meaning of having karma above life-faculty, using this as cause. If so, it is always without-essence cause. Why explain it thus? Next, this reasoning is already the Lesser Vehicle establishing the meaning of real existence of non-associated [formations] against Mahāyāna. Why use this as the basis of correct cause and blame it as not correct cause? Answer: With such doubt, there should be no having-separate-essence cause. All reasoning is like this. However, now dividing having-separate-essence and without-separate-essence: like the sound-impermanent reasoning does not rely on separate things. It just directly takes the meaning above dharmin as cause. Therefore this is without-separate-essence cause. Like the present Sarvāstivāda reasoning: above life-faculty, relying on karma to create the cause-essence. Therefore it is named having-separate-essence cause. It requires karma as separate essence from life-faculty, and this cause is then accomplished. Next, although the present correct cause has separate essence, pervading the thesis is necessarily the cause's portion. Does this reasoning lack other faulty characteristics? Therefore there is no fault. Regarding "one part each-one combined three basis non-accomplishment" etc.: The present

[Lower Section]
"each-one" is not the fault of each-one non-accomplishment. Other's one part basis non-accomplishment, self's one part basis non-accomplishment are called "one part each-one." Regarding "complete part six kinds basis non-accomplishment": Question: In the above one part faults, only having-essence three basis non-accomplishment are given. In the present complete part faults, having-essence without-essence six kinds basis non-accomplishment are comprehensively given. What reason is there for this difference? Answer: The present having-essence without-essence refers to cause's existence or non-existence. Like sound theorists establishing against Buddhist disciples "sound is permanent, because visible to eyes" is having-essence. Both establisher and opponent have this cause. Like sound theorists establishing against Buddhist disciples "sound is permanent, because basis of qualities" is without-essence. Both establisher and opponent lack this cause. However, in one part faults not giving without-essence basis non-accomplishment has the greatest reason. If there is no cause-essence, with what can one judge regarding dharmin that half lacks basis? Therefore it is limited to having-essence self-other-both three. In complete part faults, now adding without-essence three is because there is no cause-essence, therefore that cause completely lacks basis. It extends to without-essence self-other-both three. Using the cause "due to being included in qualities," this should be considered. ○ Regarding "if only saying verbal presentation [up to] all should have no four": Bright Lamp Commentary says: ○ If only taking the intrinsic characteristic of verbal presentation dharma and naming it what-is-established, places having this dharma being named same category, then there are only dharma intrinsic-characteristic contradictory causes, conveniently lacking the other three contradictory causes. ○ Not sufficient for the number four. Therefore it says "there are no four contradictory causes." Inference contradiction has four what-is-established. Namely dharma intrinsic-characteristic, dharmin intrinsic-characteristic, dharma differentiation, dharmin differentiation. Definitive contradiction also has four theses. This is only within thesis having these four meanings. ○ The reason for this is: four contradictory causes necessarily require original causes.

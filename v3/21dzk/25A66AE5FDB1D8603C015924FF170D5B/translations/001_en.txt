Private Notes on the Great Commentary on Buddhist Logic [Beginning of Upper Volume]

This is excerpted based on the intent of the Myōtō-shō (Bright Lamp Commentary) and the Collective Records. The general approach follows the Myōtō-shō.
Since there is no time to cite the concluding passages, I have included a few on-the-spot evaluations and personal interpretations.

First, the preface has five sections:

Speaking in detail: Kōsō enlightened the sage and aided the six positions to illuminate the mysterious principle. Kurai raised the immortal and expounded two volumes to reveal the truth. How could this compare to wisdom being perfect in the ten powers, cultivating myriad phenomena to establish norms, and compassion reaching its ultimate in the three wheels, expanding the five vehicles to establish standards? Therefore, responding to the capacities of beings at the twin trees, the supreme teaching spreads throughout the dusty continents; returning to true tranquility at the two rivers, the remaining influence shines through sand-numbered kalpas. How great it is! Truly difficult to name or describe!

This is the first section, describing how the Buddha's realm of wisdom is extremely profound and difficult to fathom. Within this section are two parts. From "Speaking in detail" to "reveal the truth" first presents the subtlety of external teachings. Kōsō is the name of a mountain. The place where Confucius was born has this mountain, so the name of his birthplace is used to refer to Confucius. The six positions refer to the six lines of the hexagram. Speaking approximately in terms of human affairs: the first position is the yuan-shi (lowest official), the second position is the minister, the third position is the three dukes, the fourth position is the feudal lords, the fifth position is the emperor, and the sixth position is the ancestral temple. However, since three lines only begin to create myriad phenomena but do not exhaust them, there are six lines. The three

lines represent the three powers. The three powers are Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. This is the meaning of Confucius's Confucian teaching.
Kurai is also a place name. Laozi was born in Lai village, Ku county of Chu. Therefore, the name of his birthplace is used to refer to Laozi. The two volumes refer to Laozi's upper and lower volumes of eighty-one chapters and over five thousand words. Heaven is above and Earth is below. Heaven generates through the four seasons, and Earth completes through the five elements. This is Laozi's Daoist teaching. Confucius's teaching is called Confucianism, and Laozi's teaching is called Daoism.
The above completes the description of the subtle principles of the two teachings of Confucianism and Daoism. "How could this compare to perfect wisdom" etc. next clarifies that the inner canon of Buddhist teaching is extremely profound and difficult to fathom. Saying "how could this compare" refers to the superiority and inferiority between inner and outer teachings. The ten powers are as usual: the power of knowledge of what is possible and impossible, etc. Myriad phenomena refers collectively to the two truths of nature and characteristics as myriad phenomena—the forms of formlessness. "Cultivating" means nurturing or expanding. The three wheels are turning, illuminating, and upholding, not the three wheels of mind-reading, etc. From "Therefore" to "dusty continents" clarifies that while the Buddha's opportunities for connection in one lifetime were limited, the benefits are inexhaustible. The twin trees refer to the sala grove in Kushinagar. This reveals the achievements during his lifetime. "Returning to true tranquility" etc. clarifies that because compassion and wisdom are inexhaustible, he still creates conditions for liberation for beings after his passing. Regarding the two rivers, there are many interpretations. One explanation says: first he bathed in the Nairañjanā River, then approached the Ajitavatī River and entered true tranquility. Hence it says "returning to true tranquility at the two rivers." [This is the meaning of the Myōshō-shō] Another explanation says: the source of the Ganges is one stream, but when it reaches the area of the twin grove [Note: perhaps "divided area"], it divides into two streams. The southern one is called the Golden River, and the northern one is called the Turbid River. After reaching the east of the twin grove, they merge into one again. The grove is located in the center, and the World-Honored One entered nirvana there.

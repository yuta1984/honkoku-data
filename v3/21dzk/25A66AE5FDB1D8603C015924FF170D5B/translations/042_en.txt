It does not burn the mind. The mind only cognizes that tactile heat. If so, even though the mind obtains fire's self-characteristic and takes it through contact, it is also not burned. Why say "because concentrated mind takes through separation, it is not burned" [meaning]?

"The previous rescue and objection both become wrong" - this is the general conclusion. The successive rescue and refutation-breaking that Master Ki describes are all equally wrong [meaning]. Generally, because the five sense-faculties are material dharmas, they are definitely separate from the function of contact and separation. Because mind has no distinction of being here or there, it is neither separate nor in contact. However, when judging according to the functions of the supporting faculties, sometimes contact, sometimes separation, sometimes connected to both separation and contact. Therefore, speaking according to reality, because there is no separation or contact, one should not say "concentrated mind takes separate objects." If again judging by principle, because it takes both contact and separation, one also should not say "because it takes separate objects, it is not burned." Also, because mind has no form or substance and is not the four great elements, it is not damaged. Whether obtaining self-characteristics through contact or obtaining self-characteristics through separation, fire should not burn mind. Why specially say "because it takes separation, it is not burned"? Also, because mind originally has no location and is neither contact nor separation, yet both contact and separation, even when fire comes and contacts the body, body-consciousness and mental consciousness are not burned, and even when fire comes without contact, concentrated mind can obtain fire's self-characteristics. This is because separation and contact are difficult to determine, and the function is inconceivable. If determining it as uniformly separate, how could it obtain self-characteristics? Carefully considering Master Ki's explanation, there are such doubts. Because the commentary master maintains this point in his discussion, he probably investigates and refutes it in various ways.

"If like saying fire obtains fire's self-characteristics [...] mind should feel heat" - this is the commentary master explaining the doctrine of objecting to non-theists. If it were like today's main commentary text, there are two doctrines. The first doctrine objects to "should burn the mouth." The latter doctrine - "should burn the mouth" is not the correct objection. The correct objection should be: "If conventional language obtains self-characteristics, then when relating to fire's conventional language, that

[Lower Section]

mind that seeks the name and takes fire should feel tactile heat. Because conventional language already obtains fire's self-characteristics, and fire's self-characteristics are tactile heat [meaning]." This is because non-theists' names obtain self-characteristics, so the mind that relates to those names also obtains self-characteristics. Therefore this objection exists. If it were like the continued commentary text, because there are three doctrines, the text says: "If like saying fire obtains fire's self-characteristics, it immediately burns and heats the mouth. This is based on saying fire being in the mouth. If saying obtaining self-characteristics, self-characteristics also do not leave the mouth. Therefore it should burn the mouth. Or possibly, this is a suppressed objection. It does not correctly object to 'the mouth being burned.' Because the mouth is the condition for producing speech, not actual speech, the correct objection is that the sound should be burned. Same as body-tactile dust, both have obstruction. Or possibly, objecting to that mind that seeks names and takes objects, it also obtains self-characteristics. Those who obtain self-characteristics - their minds should feel heat [etc.]." The first doctrine is the objection "should burn the mouth," the next doctrine is the objection "should burn the sound," the latter doctrine is the objection "mind relating to names should feel heat."

"If others make counter-objections [...] because of knowing according to objects" - if non-theists make counter-objections to our Mahāyāna, you non-theists should submit yourselves. That objection does not concern our Mahāyāna school [meaning]. This is regarding the final objection among the many objections above, which should be counter-objected to. The non-theists' objection-intention says: If your Mahāyāna objects to us saying "minds that seek names and relate to fire should feel tactile heat," then minds in your school that seek names and relate to fire should also

feel heat [meaning]. Mahāyāna's intention says: If making counter-objections like this, this objection does not involve our school. Why? Because your minds that seek names and relate to fire obtain self-characteristics, therefore one objects that they should feel tactile heat. I do not say "provisional cognition seeking names obtains self-characteristics," therefore one cannot object "should feel tactile heat" [meaning].

"If feeling tactile heat etc." - the intention says: In our school, minds that know the self-characteristics of tactile heat are immediately not provisional cognition seeking names. Because they know according to objects [meaning].

"Even in concentrated mind [...] the accompanied image-aspects also have no heat etc." - the Mingdeng Commentary says: Above clarifies that scattered mind's provisional cognition seeking names does not obtain self-characteristics. Now this text clarifies that concentrated mind's provisional cognition seeking names also does not obtain self-characteristics. Question: If seeking names and relating to fire etc. in concentrated mind is also provisional cognition not obtaining self-characteristics, why do all places say "all concentrated minds are direct perception"? ○ Answer: Pure minds arise relating to teachings. However, being free from discrimination, there is no different-activity transformation. Therefore pure minds are all called direct perception. All contaminated concentrated minds of conditioned-characteristic paths, compared to characteristic-less cognition, are called having discrimination. However, regarding objects, they distinguish like objects, without different-activity transformation, therefore all are direct perception. ○ "Like provisional-characteristic concentration transforming water, fire etc." - when two-vehicle practitioners and ordinary beings perform ten-totality contemplations etc., this is called provisional-imagination concentration. ○ These performed imaginations are only internal mental thinking, unable to actually transform, therefore called provisional imagination. If bodhisattvas who have entered the grounds perform such contemplations in pure mind, this is real, not provisional. ○ Question: If bodhisattvas transforming water, fire etc. is real, not provisional, when their bodies are in it, do they have burning, warming etc. functions? Answer: Though having the function of benefiting others, there is no function of harming oneself. Because mind attains mastery. "Like concentrated mind relating to lower-realm

[Lower Section]

fire etc." - this only speaks about concentration mental-consciousness relating to lower-realm fire. That is, sole-reflection objects having no real function [etc.]. Therefore the main intention of responding to non-theists' counter-objections is: whether scattered mind or concentrated mind, minds seeking names and taking objects are all provisional cognition. Because they are provisional cognition, they do not obtain true self-characteristics. Because they do not obtain self-characteristics, there is no counter-objection "should feel heat" [meaning].

"Like provisional-imagination concentration" - this presents the substance of mind seeking names in concentrated mind not obtaining true self-characteristics. However, because these obtained characteristics are not like what inferential mind obtains, though also called "obtaining self-characteristics," they are not true self-characteristics [meaning]. Therefore, though being direct perception, seeking names ○ still does not obtain true self-characteristics. Therefore there are no real functions like burning [meaning].

"Like the above concentrated mind etc." - this presents evidence that though being direct perception, the transformed image-aspects have no real function. This is to prove the doctrine that provisional-imagination concentration, though being direct perception, does not obtain true self-characteristics.

"Question: If so, actually transforming etc." - this raises the eighth consciousness's transformations and the Tathāgata's and great bodhisattvas' transformations etc. - real-function transformed water, fire etc. - to question the previous doctrine. The intention is: if various provisional cognitions of concentration and scattering do not obtain true self-characteristics, therefore transformations have no real function and do not feel heat, then if such minds can obtain self-characteristics and transformations have real function, should those minds feel heat etc. [meaning]? Though seeming to question the presence or absence of real function, those minds are also like this.

"Answer: Though having function etc." - though the eighth's transformations have real function, because they naturally transform fire-substance self-characteristics within, they do not burn mind [meaning]. Not burning mind means not feeling heat [meaning].

"Concentrated mind is also thus" - the Tathāgata's and great bodhisattvas' concentrated minds' transformations are also like this [meaning].

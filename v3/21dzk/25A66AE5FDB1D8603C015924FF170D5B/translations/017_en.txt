Then within same examples there is also inseparable nature. Namely, the impermanence of pot, the pot of impermanence - like this, while mutually different, they have inseparable nature. Therefore thesis and example are similar.

Question: Regarding judging same examples in relation to the established dharma, what is the meaning of this "established dharma"? "Established" refers to what is established by the general thesis of inseparable nature. "Dharma" refers to the predicate. When we now say "established dharma," it is unclear whether "established" is identical to "dharma" or whether it is "dharma of the established."

Answer: The Bright Lamp Commentary has two interpretations. First: the meaning of established-as-dharma. This tradition's intention sees "impermanence of sound" as the established. This is the thesis of inseparable nature where established is identical to predicate dharma. Second: the meaning of dharma-of-the-established. This tradition's intention places "established" and "dharma" separately. The present predicate dharma is seen as the dharma of the established general thesis. Therefore both traditions are correct in judging same examples in relation to the predicate. Details are in the Bright Lamp Commentary, which should be consulted.

Question: "If so, regarding sound's upper [qualities]..." This question's meaning concerns "therefore raising this dharma to reflect that collection." If so, when first establishing the inference of sound's impermanence, that impermanence meaning becomes what the cause establishes, so other meanings like no-self should not be what the cause establishes. Therefore they cannot be thesis. Since not being thesis, they cannot exist in the thesis. Since absent from thesis, the no-self meanings on pots should necessarily reside in different categories. Since there is no established here [meaning].

Answer: "If they do not accept that..." This answer's meaning says: What is now questioned - do they accept those no-self meanings as meanings above the subject, or not? If not accepting, then indeed as questioned, they should reside in different categories. Having no established and cause not operating. If accepting subject meanings,

[Lower Section]
this question should not arise. What collateral intention accepts can all become what cause accomplishes. Moreover, no-self etc. being meanings above the subject sound is inevitable. Therefore taking no-self etc. on pots as same category, they should not reside in different categories. Due to this logical force, there are also things of subject-distinction contradictions [meaning]. Taking what words state as established means there cannot be subject distinctions etc. Back-writings etc. do not accord with this meaning? This should still be considered.

"Here already explaining different categories of thesis..." From above up to the present text, same categories and different categories in the text specifically have examples relating to thesis, establishing same-different categories. Therefore specifically thesis same-different. Therefore this text is also necessary. Comparing sound and space, saying "calling it non-produced," raising different categories of cause also serves to explain universal absence [meaning].

"Productive nature cause [up to] three characteristics all universal, energetic cause accomplishing same definite others universal..." When using productive to establish impermanence, it is not same category definite existence. Therefore saying "three characteristics all universal." When using energetic to establish impermanence, lightning-pot serve as same examples. Having in pot but not in lightning. Therefore only saying "same category definite existence," not saying universal. In first-last two characteristics, both causes do not differ from the two causes. Judging universal-definite is easy to understand.

"If productive cause also can establish verbally stated suffering etc. and impermanence thesis intentionally accepted suffering etc." - verbally stated suffering etc. refers to established inferences etc. in the text below. Taking collaterally intended accepted suffering to separately make inferences.

And impermanence thesis intentionally accepted suffering etc. just uses collateral meaning analogously placed in thesis - suffering etc. meanings. This

section's main meaning is: all various meanings existing above sound cannot all become what productive cause accomplishes. According to appropriateness and correspondence, these should be established. Among the various meanings of so-called emptiness, no-self etc., first the suffering meaning should not become accomplished. If becoming accomplished, there would be faults of indeterminacy etc. [meaning].

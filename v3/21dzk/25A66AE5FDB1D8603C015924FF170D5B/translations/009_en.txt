others," not saying "self-understanding," etc. [etc.]. The present text has this meaning. Although the original intent of fallacious establishment and fallacious refutation is to enlighten others, they ultimately do not elicit others' understanding. When others in turn criticize their errors, one consequently [考note: perhaps "still" in the original text] generates understanding. Therefore it definitely connects to self-understanding. However, the original intent is to enlighten others. Witnesses immediately understand right and wrong. Therefore both relate to understanding others [meaning].

Also saying "The prose is the same as what Hetucakra explains," etc. Bright Lamp Commentary says: Examining the text of the entire Hetucakra, there are three major sections. From the initial "For the purpose of selection and retention" down to "For opening and enlightening others, explaining these means of proof and fallacious means of proof," it clarifies the true-fallacious means of proof in the gate of understanding others. The second, "For self-opening and understanding, there are only direct perception and inference" and below clarifies the true-fallacious perception-this in the gate of self-understanding. The third, "Having explained means of proof and fallacious means of proof, should explain means of refutation and fallacious means of refutation" and below - although the treatise does not mark this as the gate of understanding others, according to this small treatise, this interprets the true-fallacious means of refutation within the gate of understanding others. Among the three major sections: in the first section, true-fallacious two establishments are made into separate two sections. In the second section, true perception-inference are combined into one section. In the third section, true-fallacious both refutations are made into separate two sections. Generally six sections interpret the meaning of eight gates. Therefore this small treatise's prose six sections are the same as Hetucakra. ○ The method of hetuvidyā is first establishment then refutation. First establishment means the first four sections among the six sections. Although perception-inference true-fallacious are not true establishment, being components of establishment, they are generally called first establishment. Later refutation means the latter two sections among the six sections. Although fallacious means of refutation cannot refute others, being a type of refutation, they are generally called later refutation, etc. [etc.].

Does Hetucakra lack text combining fallacious perception-fallacious inference into one section? However, since true perception-true inference are combined into one section, perhaps the meaning is obtained by being categorically included therein?
[End indentation]

Also saying "Both proximate and distant means of proof have true-fallacious, clarified through individual characteristics." Collected Records says: Ying says: That is, in relation to the thesis to be established, proximate and distant are distinguished. Proximate means cause-example. Distant means direct perception-inference. ○ The commentary's "clarified through individual characteristics" means: after true establishment, fallacious establishment is clarified; before fallacious cognition, true cognition is clarified [etc.].

Question: Looking at the commentary text, in the second interpretation, although it explains the similarities and differences in sequence between verse and prose, it does not harmonize the differences in opening-combining. Why is the answer lacking? Answer: Opening-combining same meaning, harmonizing interpretation is like the first interpretation. Should this be maintained? Therefore yielding to the previous and omitting?
[End indentation]

In the third interpretation, "Although essence and words have no difference in object," etc. The meaning says: True establishment-fallacious establishment, true cognition-fallacious cognition all have separate essences. However, establishment and establishment components are all included in establishment. Therefore as one category they are initially listed. Means of refutation-fallacious refutation both have separate objects. However, their establishment objects should be stated later. Therefore as one category they are listed later [meaning].

Another version says: "Objects have no difference" [etc.]. This meaning is: the previous version making objects separate is because fallacious and true differ. This version having no difference in objects is because although true-fallacious differ, the essence is one establishment. Like this version: the upper four sections, having separate essences, form one listing. The lower two sections, having same objects, form one listing [meaning].

"Following what the eight accomplish ○ revealing existent things as the essence of means of proof." Bright Lamp Commentary says: "Following what the eight accomplish," etc. - the first interpretation's meaning says: The eight meanings are what accomplishes; thesis is what is accomplished. What accomplishes and what is accomplished have no meaning of separation. Through having what is accomplished, there begins to be what accomplishes. If abandoning what is accomplished and independently discussing what accomplishes, then one does not know what these eight meanings accomplish. ○ Still mutually influencing. That is, these three interpretations all shadow the treatise's text. Saying the eight meanings are what accomplishes, then one shadow-knows that thesis is what they accomplish. ○ This is the mutual opposition of what accomplishes-what is accomplished. Also "thesis-what is established follows within means of proof," etc. is the second explanation's meaning. Although in words it indicates eight gates means of proof, in meaning it implicitly permits that the thesis to be established is also therein. Like under the indicating one cause-word, there must be indication of three characteristic meanings. ○ Saying eight gates are means of proof, then one shadow-knows that what is established is therein. ○ This is the mutual opposition of means of proof-what is established. ○ Also "all existent things in the meaning of observation," etc. is the third explanation's meaning. The dharma to be established is called the meaning of observation. That is, the thesis to be established. The dharma that can accord is called all existent things. That is, the cause-examples of means of proof. The meaning of eight gates is generally called all existent things. The cognition that can observe is the perception-inference two cognitions among the eight meanings. Saying perception-inference are what can reveal, then one shadow-knows that what is observed is in that thesis. ○ Not raising that thesis, what does one observe? - that is, among the eight meanings, raising the cognition that can observe, not shadow-raising that thesis which is observed. Perception-inference cognition - what do they observe? This is the mutual opposition of what can observe-what is observed. ○ A record says: This third

interpretation discussing the reason why prose raises thesis is incorrect [etc.].

Collected Records says: Zhou says: This third interpretation discusses the reason why prose raises thesis. Eup says: This commentary does not answer the immediate question. It is just repeatedly explaining in detail the meaning of "thesis etc. multi-words means of proof" in the treatise. ○ That is, making three explanations. First: raising the thesis to be established, mutually taking cause-examples as means of proof. Second: words do not violate ancient explanations, thesis etc. as means of proof. This third interpretation: raising the thesis to be observed, revealing existent things as the essence of means of proof. However, the previous question-answer about verses not including thesis is just riding on the previous two explanations, consequently having intervallic generation. In the textual momentum, it is not completely separate [etc.].

Yogācāra also says: Six types of discourse are: discourse, advocacy, disputation, slander discourse, accordance-generating teaching discourse, path discourse. The essence of these six corresponds to word-producing, word-understanding, cognition-understanding.

Answer: "Hetucakra says: In logical formulations etc. explaining these multi-words ○ therefore examining in detail that ancient and modern means of proof completeness necessarily depends on multi-words" - within this there are two sections of expressing and blocking. Hetucakra saying [...] called means of proof expresses the reason for taking multi-words as means of proof. The general meaning says: World-relative and other ancient explanations take multi-words as means of proof. Therefore not violating them. Also taking multi-words as means of proof. Seeking those multi-words, they are the three characteristics of cause. Not thesis etc. Therefore words do not violate the ancient, meaning differs from the ancient. This reveals the completeness of meaning. Necessarily [考note: perhaps "depending on" in original text] relying on multi-words [meaning].

Also "words of one or two" and below blocks the tendency that words of one or two are insufficient for means of proof. That meaning is easy to understand. "Perhaps contrary establishment dharma" - if same class lacks different examples, although comparing and attaching to thesis, able to

Therefore it says "returning to true tranquility at the two rivers." [This is one interpretation among the many explanations cited in the Collective Records. Although there are many explanations, the above two explanations seem credible. Therefore I record them.]

The above concludes the first section.

Now the twenty-eight views swarmed like ants in the five heavens, and the sixteen masters spread like hawks over the four lords. Here there was a bodhisattva named Śaṅkara. He was a disciple of the sage Nāgārjuna (Dragon Tree). Having already received good guidance, he truly had the title of "much learning." He drew from the ocean of wisdom in his deep heart and erected the mountain of meaning in his inner recesses. Therefore he carved through the thorny peaks to mine uncut gems, and wandered the shell-bearing shores to seek pearls. With secret contemplation concentrated, he finally composed a great treatise. Its purport was complex but its writing concise; its principles profound yet easy to understand. Truly it was the pivot of the dharma gate and the key to the mysterious portal. It finally caused the Sāṅkhya and Vaiśeṣika schools to be like high mountains crushing spring eggs, and made the theories of eternal sound and manifested sound like startled whirlwinds scattering autumn leaves.

This is the second section, clarifying how the Bodhisattva Īśvara composed the "Treatise on Entering Right Reasoning" and explained the eight principles of Buddhist logic found in the Buddhist scriptures. The twenty-eight views are: view of characteristics, view of diminishing establishment, view of diminishing discrimination, view of diminishing reality, view of grasping texts, view of reversal, view of no fault, view of liberation, view of contempt, view of indignation, view of inversion, view of generation, view of not establishing positions, view of deception, view of reverent service, view of stubborn ignorance, view of fundamentals, view of having no view regarding views, view of abandoning skillful means, view of non-liberation, view of obstructive augmentation, view of generating wrong theories, view of no merit or result, view of accepting humiliation, view of slander, view of being unpraiseworthy, view of vastness, and view of pride. The sixteen masters refer to the ninety-five categories of non-Buddhist schools, whose general meaning does not exceed sixteen different theories. The sixteen different theories are as usual. The four lords are

human lords, jewel lords, etc. "Good guidance" refers to what the Analects says about Yan Yuan: "The Master was gentle yet persistent in his teaching." This means the Master properly used this way to encourage people with proper sequence. The Master refers to Confucius. "Gentle persistence" means proper sequence. Thus receiving the Buddha's guidance, Ānanda gained the title of "much learning," and receiving Nāgārjuna's guidance, Īśvara gained the epithet of "much learning." Inner recesses refer to the heart. Generally speaking, "heart" is the common name for the six organs and five viscera. Thorny peaks refer to mountains in Jing Province. Jing Province is probably Chu. In the mountains of that province, one particularly receives imperial orders to mine uncut gems. Shell-bearing shores refer to shores near the South Sea. Shells emerge from the shores. Pearls are found within the shells. This is used as a metaphor for Īśvara gathering the true principles from Buddhist scriptures and collecting the profound essence of the logical treatises. High mountains - "high" means lofty, so lofty mountains are called "high mountains." Startled whirlwinds are great winds, hence startling great winds.

From that time forward, doctrinal contemplation spread like waves, victorious traces began to manifest, and devoted study expanded. [Note: the commentary text says "ended." The collator says: what follows is stated in the notes] [The commentary text refers to the Kenwu 2nd year honorific manuscript kept at the original Kasuga Logic Hall] Truly, the golden form adhered to dreams and the jade tablets illuminated the dawn. Although the supreme teaching had already flourished, this classic was not yet complete.

This is the third section, clarifying that the original [Note: the text collation says "former" perhaps] dynasty's Tripiṭaka masters and others were wrong. From "from that time" to "expanded" first describes the flourishing in India. The meaning is that Dignāga and Īśvara each composed these treatises, refuting the false and establishing the correct. From then on, all the worthies of the five heavens revered this Buddhist logic. Doctrinal contemplation means teaching and contemplative thought. Victorious traces - "traces" means tracks, so victorious tracks are called "victorious traces." "Truly" and following clarify that it had not yet been practiced in the Han lands. Golden form refers to Emperor Ming of Han dreaming of a golden figure.

Jade tablets refer to the transmitted scriptures. "Tablets" refers to bamboo slips, the common designation for scriptural texts. These are palm-leaf manuscripts. In contrast to "golden form," they are called "jade tablets."

Only our personal teacher, the Tripiṭaka master, whose way penetrated the five sciences and whose reputation echoed through a thousand ages. Lamenting the ever-increasing distance from the sages and grieving that the ice in his heart had not yet melted, he finally shook his staff in the central region to set out from the land of enlightenment, sought teachers in the western lands, and went directly to Gṛdhrakūṭa mountain. He investigated what the ancient sages had not heard, encompassing it all in his mind's depths; he mastered what previous worthies had not witnessed, thoroughly penetrating the pivot of emotion. Thereupon palm leaves were selected for subtle words, and he returned to his homeland by divine powers. The foreign language was already translated and the principles of the Way were fully expressed.

This is the fourth section, clarifying that Xuanzang Tripiṭaka's translation is correct. Regarding the central region to the city of enlightenment: Among the five heavens, Magadha is the greatest country. The city of Gayā is in this country. Not far from that city [the Buddha] achieved perfect enlightenment, so saying "the land of the city of enlightenment" now combines both general and specific. That is, Magadha country is general, while Gayā city and the Bodhi tree location are specific. Now combining general and specific, it says "the land of the city of enlightenment." [Meaning of the Bright Lamp Commentary]
One explanation says: The place where the youth Sudhana first aroused the aspiration for enlightenment is called the City of Enlightenment. This is explained in the Avatamsaka Sutra. The new Avatamsaka calls it the City of Fortune. Since the master set out from here, it is used as a metaphor. [Meaning of the Collective Records]
Central region: India is called the central region, or the great Tang dynasty is called the central region.

Ji humbly joined the ranks of disciples, rejoicing in dying in the evening after hearing in the morning. Fearing this Way would not be practiced, he briefly composed this explanatory commentary, showing the essential principles and presenting the hidden doctrine. May those enlightened ones who suspend the mirror of wisdom kindly apply their minds and

illuminate and examine it.

This is the fifth section, describing Master Ji's modesty and composition. "Ranks of disciples" means participating and joining the equal ranks of disciples. "Rejoicing in dying in the evening after hearing in the morning" refers to the Analects saying: "If I hear the Way in the morning, I can die in the evening without regret," etc. Explanatory commentary means simplifying and opening up. This refers to the present great commentary.

The above concludes the preface.

Now regarding "The Buddhist logic treatise has its source only in the Buddha's teaching," etc. Question: The source of Buddhist logic is what was expounded by Akṣapāda at the beginning of the kalpa. Even if it exists in Buddhism, the source is only the teaching of non-Buddhists. How can one say "only the Buddha's teaching"? Moreover, in which Buddhist scripture are the methods of the three members [of a logical argument] enumerated? Answer: The Bright Lamp Commentary says: The nature of dharma is extremely profound; only omniscient wisdom can exhaust it completely. ○ The individual characteristics of all phenomena are not definitely one or different. Both existence and non-existence are incorrect; the path of mind and speech is cut off. ○ But without words there is no way to generate the four wisdoms; without wisdom there is no way to explain the two emptinesses. Therefore, the Dharma King, according to the superiority and inferiority of faculties, briefly opened the scriptures of the two piṭakas and, following their inclinations, extensively explained the teachings of the five sciences. ○ This is precisely why the Tathāgata's original teaching arose. However, later supreme teachings have profound intent. Therefore various heterodox teachers composed treatises according to their understanding. ○ Now marking its source, it therefore says "the source is only the Buddha's teaching." [And so forth. One should examine from beginning to end.]
I privately say: This meaning is that Akṣapāda's teaching at the beginning of the kalpa has its source in the teaching of past Buddhas, perhaps. The Collective Records say: The commentary's "Buddhist logic ○ only the Buddha's teaching" - Yui says: Like the Nirvana Sutra, it refutes the ten non-Buddhist schools, contains thesis, reason, and example, and correctly clarifies establishment and refutation. What the various scriptures call individual and universal characteristics are precisely the manifest [teachings] of Buddhist logic.

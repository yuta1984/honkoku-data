Inference contradiction and definitive contradiction necessarily must change other causes. Since the meaning is already differentiated, therefore only within the thesis are there these four meanings. They do not extend to cause and example. If one only takes the intrinsic characteristic of verbally presented dharma and names it what-is-established, and names places having this dharma as same category, then inference contradiction etc. should all lack the four [etc.]. Regarding "if completely same on dharmin [up to] also no different category": Bright Lamp Commentary says: Someone says that equal-meaning category refers to all dharmin except the thesis, all being named meaning-category. If that meaning-category has what-is-established dharma and is all equal to what the thesis establishes, such meaning-category is finally named same category. Now refuting this explanation, it therefore says "then no same category etc." If excluding the thesis, all dharmin are named meaning-category, and what is same as this meaning-category is named same category, then dharmin like pots do not resemble the thesis dharmin, therefore cannot be named "same." Therefore it says "then no same category." If that person tries to rescue by saying that although not resembling, they are called same, then different categories like space should be same category. Therefore it says "also no different category" [etc.]. Regarding "thesis has one part accordance" etc.: Bright Lamp Commentary says: When establishing the thesis "sound is impermanent," although that impermanence meaning contradicts others and accords with oneself, being a correct true thesis, among all meanings on dharmin, self and no-self etc. are commonly accepted by both establisher and opponent, becoming what cause accomplishes. Since establishment is already accomplished, it is called "one part accordance" [etc.]. Regarding "however treatises often explain" etc.: Same category in treatises is often called same category, while cause same category is often named same dharma [meaning]. Now explaining the reason for speaking thus. Below where different category is explained also has this text. That also has this meaning. Regarding "depending on the above two characteristics" etc.: These are the first two among the three characteristics of cause. The meaning of the present Reason Door Treatise's challenge is: regarding the confrontation of the first two characteristics, how can what universally is thesis dharma also be definitely present in same category? Namely, the produced cause follows and attaches to the thesis sound, using this to regard the produced aspect of pot - this is already a place of difference. How can it then turn to the produced aspect at the pot's place and be definitely present? [meaning].

[Lower Section]
Regarding "or the produced cause" etc.: This is the second explanation of grasping the meaning of the Reason Door challenge. The meaning of this explanation's challenge is: the produced cause is a separate dharma above sound, each being separate regarding sound. Since this cause is also sound's meaning, regarding pot it is also a separate place. Regarding thesis and regarding example, all are separate. How does the universal characteristic penetrate thesis and example? [meaning].

[Indented one character]
Generally, the meaning of grasping cause-essence has two considerations. Temporarily regarding produced cause: First, it says the produced contained within this cause is only the produced meaning above sound. It does not accommodate the produced meaning of pot. Pot's produced aspect is just what equals this. It does not enter within cause. Second, it says: penetrating pot's produced aspect has no fault. Universal characteristics are originally like thread, being only one thing. Although sound and pot differ, the produced meaning above them originally penetrates.

These two meanings are evaluations from the current scholarly session.

"Namely among nine sentences, fourth and sixth [up to] do not completely include the rest":
[Indented two characters]
Fourth sentence construction [same category non-existent, different category existent]
[Indented one character]
Sound is permanent because of produced nature. Same example like space. Different example like pot.
[Indented two characters]
Sixth sentence construction [same category non-existent, different category existent and non-existent]
[Indented one character]
Sound is permanent because of nature produced by effort without interval. Same example like space. Different examples like lightning and pot.

The present explanation is that in these two constructions, there are faults of dharma intrinsic-characteristic contradiction. The other three contradictory causes do not completely include them. One should examine by seeing the constructions. Collected Records and Bright Lamp Commentary explain them in detail. They should be consulted.
[End indentation]

Regarding "among these first three sentences, only a small part of the third sentence is correct cause": Collected Records says: Question: In this fourth sentence also there is a small part of correct cause. Why speak only of the third? Answer: Although reaching the fourth sentence there is a small part of correct cause, saying "correct cause" now only discusses the second characteristic. Therefore not taking the correct cause within the fourth is immediately included in the third characteristic [etc.]. This meaning is: the present section explains same category definite existence. Therefore judging correct cause at this characteristic's side exists only in the small part of the third sentence among the first three of these four sentences. The fourth sentence is the both-not sentence, not same category definite existence. Since it makes sentence-essence regarding different category universal non-existence, although it has the 2-8 correct causes, it concludes "only a small part of the third sentence is correct cause." Nevertheless, since it is actually correct cause, below the fourth sentence it judges "2-8 correct causes, fifth indeterminate." Therefore ultimately, if explaining the section on different category universal non-existence, one should also judge correct cause regarding that characteristic. Regarding "category means collection-type, not essence-type meaning [up to] following essence having existence or non-existence": Question: Taking those with essence or without essence, accordingly making them examples applies to both same category and different category. Yet why say "different category is not essence-type meaning, same category is essence-type meaning"? Answer: Although their meaning is actually equal, same category is the gate of positive statement. Whether positing existence or non-existence, expressing thing-characteristics necessarily makes comparisons, so it is necessarily essence-type meaning. Different category is the gate of negative statement. Therefore it does not discuss having essence or lacking essence.

[Lower Section]
Now only the meaning of the portion lacking what-is-established is different category. Therefore it is said to be non-essence-type meaning. Explaining the meaning again: ultimately, same examples necessarily have both example-basis and example-essence complete. Since that basis is thing-essence, same example category-words are essence-type meaning. Although different examples necessarily have example-essence, example-basis is not necessarily complete. Even without that thing-essence, just with the meaning-portion of lacking what-is-established, they are created as different examples. Therefore different example category-words are non-essence-type meaning. Space, turtle-hair etc. are still things having example-basis. Now lacking example-basis means completely lacking name-essence. Nevertheless, following same category, inferring that meaning makes different examples. Therefore different examples also necessarily have example-essence. Example-essence is meaning. Regarding "should have three categories [up to] then becomes third category" etc.: Like ancient masters explained, if taking contradictory harm as different category, outside same-different two categories there should be non-same non-different category. Namely, temporarily establishing good thesis, what accords with this becomes same category, unwholesome becomes different category, neutral should become the third non-same non-different category. Since neutral is not same category, its meaning is easily known. Also not different category, because it does not contradict good. Everything is like this. Therefore it becomes three categories. However, according to Dignāga and others, places lacking what-is-established are definitively named different category. When temporarily establishing good thesis, neutral and unwholesome both lack what-is-established. Therefore they are included in different category. They do not become three categories. Regarding "if different from dharma [up to] all different dharmas should be named same" etc.: This challenge's meaning says: The opponent does not accept predicate dharma thesis. Temporarily, the opponent does not accept that there is impermanence above impermanent sound. Therefore before the opponent, there is permanent meaning above sound. Since this is so, when predicate dharma thesis judges same-different regarding space, it is completely not different category. Predicate permanence and space are same category. That lack of

Against the no-space theory, establishing this inference has absolutely no fault of both non-establishment. The reason is as stated in the commentary text. The meaning of the text is stated in the marginal notes: Yi says: "This old commentary provisionally narrates the Sound school's defense, saying: 'The permanence and non-obstruction on the sound thesis both possess negation-affirmation. Empty space is without substance and also has only negation. Speaking of particulars, since both are already established, it is not that the general probans is lacking.'" This means: permanence and non-obstruction on sound have different probans and thesis-predicate. This is called "particular." Each possessing negation-affirmation is called "both established." The two establishments on the example are called "general probans." Since empty space already permits negation, it does not make the two establishments lacking in the example. How can this be called both non-establishment? [etc.] The repeated meaning says: Since there are already negating thesis-predicate and negating probans on the example, the two establishments are not lacking. Why make it both non-establishment? [so to speak]

"Answer: If the Sound school [...] non-establishment fault" - this is Wengui answering the Sound school's defensive question himself. The meaning is stated in the marginal notes: Yi says: "The ancient master answered the previous defense saying: 'The non-obstruction reason negates obstruction and affirms non-obstruction. Though empty space is without substance and lacks the affirmed non-obstruction, it can also negate obstruction, so not lacking the probans is as stated. Establishing the permanence thesis correctly establishes the affirmed permanence, not the negated impermanence. Since empty space is already non-existent, how is the affirmation not thesis-predicate non-establishment?'" etc. [etc.] One should see that commentary [etc.] The meaning of this answer is that Wengui, regarding the Sound school's defense, has permission and non-permission - he permits the aspect of there being no probans non-establishment. Since the non-obstruction reason correctly establishes negation, there is a probans on the negating example. He does not permit the aspect of there being no thesis-predicate non-establishment. Since the permanence thesis does not correctly establish negation, there is no thesis-predicate on the negating example [so to speak]. Therefore, what Wengui's meaning conveys is having the Sound school make a defense, changing both non-establishment to thesis-predicate non-establishment [as seen]. What the treatise calls the methodology of both non-establishment means: when the Sound school does not make this defense, it is both non-establishment, so this is raised. If this defensive establishment is made, does it finally become thesis-predicate non-establishment?

"This also is not so [...] why is it not lacking the probans?" - the commentary master refutes Wengui's finally making it thesis-predicate non-establishment. The meaning is: on empty space, it is not only lacking the affirmed permanence, but also lacking the affirmed non-obstruction. Having already lost both establishments, it should still fall into both non-establishment [so to speak].

"Also refuting another's defense [...] can also establish the example" - this is Wengui refuting the Sautrāntika defense and establishing that the empty space example still has no probans non-establishment. First, regarding the Sautrāntika's counter-defense meaning, the marginal notes say: Yi says: "This cites another's defensive words from the previous commentary. Who makes the same defense? Answer: Previously the Sound school was already against the no-space theorists. This is precisely the Sautrāntika defense. They say: 'The reason possesses negation-affirmation; empty space is without substance and should have only negation. The example does not resemble the reason, therefore the Sound school's inference establishing sound as permanent does not succeed'" [etc.] This defense also still constitutes both non-establishment. The general approach is like the commentary master's refutation. There should still be probans non-establishment [so to speak]. Next, Master Gui's refutation meaning is stated in the marginal notes: Though throat and staff differ, their function is the same, therefore the example succeeds. Though affirmation and non-affirmation differ, the meaning of negation is already equal. Why does the example not succeed? [etc.] This criticism still only constitutes thesis-predicate non-establishment, like Wengui's previous answer.

"This also is not so [...] does not participate in this example" - the commentary master refutes Wengui. The meaning is: the made-ness reason and pot example both have made-ness. Namely, negation-affirmation are also the same. Therefore on the example it can serve as the probans reason. The empty space example has only negation without affirmation, completely unlike the reason. Therefore there is no probans on the example. In that case reason and example resemble each other; in this case reason and example do not resemble each other at all. They cannot be compared [so to speak].

"Also saying: If only negation [...] not according to possessing negation-affirmation" - Master Wengui cites the doctrine that because the empty space example has only negation, there is probans non-establishment, and refutes this by drawing an analogy. The meaning says: Hīnayāna establishes an inference against Mahāyāna saying: "Empty space is permanent because it is unmade, like cessation through discrimination." The reason of this inference possesses negation-affirmation before the establisher - the empty space that Hīnayāna permits is unmade and has the substance of unmade-ness. Before the opponent it has only negation. Though Mahāyāna [admits] empty space is unmade, it does not permit there to be the substantial nature of unmade-ness. If according to your doctrine, when establishing against an opponent, if the opponent only permits negation and there should be a fault, this inference should have the fault of other one-sided non-establishment. [The text saying "regarding self" means regarding the establisher's own school. Because it should incur the fault of other one-sided, it says so.] Observing the opponent, because the unmade-ness reason has only negation, yet this inference already has no such fault. Think analogically: the current Sound school inference also, before the opponent the empty space example is still only negation, yet there should not be probans non-establishment. Therefore know: probans non-establishment does not exist according to the reason possessing negation-affirmation while the example has only negation [so to speak]. The repeated analogical meaning says: that sectarian school's established inference's thesis possesses negation-affirmation, the reason before the opponent has only negation, yet there is already no fault of other one-sided non-establishment. This Sound school's

[Lower Section]

established inference's reason possesses negation-affirmation, the example before the opponent has only negation - why would there be the fault of probans non-establishment? [so to speak]

"This meaning takes establishing against opponent [...] makes it an uncertainty fault" - the commentary master, wanting to refute Wengui, first states his doctrinal meaning. The point is as above.

"Only those who completely do not permit are example faults" - if opponents completely do not permit affirmation and negation on the example, this truly should become probans non-establishment. Since this is not so, they permit negation. How would it become probans non-establishment? [so to speak]

"Therefore taking this inference as different, an uncertainty fault" - therefore, because that Hīnayāna established inference has no one-sided non-establishment, it should only have the fault of uncertainty [so to speak]. Using rabbit horns as the dissimilar class, the fault of uncertainty should be attached. When Hīnayāna opposes Mahāyāna, the inference for empty space having permanent substance cannot be stopped without fault. Therefore this inference should be made an uncertainty fault. The repeated meaning says: this inference should all be an uncertainty fault, not a one-sided non-establishment [so to speak]. Because it is an inference that uncontroversially commits uncertainty. This is generally Wengui's meaning.

[One character indent]
Question: The Continued Commentary says "therefore taking this inference as uncertainty and contradiction fault" [etc.] Adding the word "contradiction." Thinking of the main commentary through the continued commentary, is it not that using rabbit horns with the opponent is not uncertainty?

Answer: In the continued commentary under "this inference is also not equal" etc., beyond the uncertainty and other faults raised in the main commentary, it adds the fault of contradicting the particular characteristics of the subject. Think of this. Now saying "uncertainty and contra-"

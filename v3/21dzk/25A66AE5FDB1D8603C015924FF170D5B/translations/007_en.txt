sentences. Because there is nothing to correspond to. Together making twenty-eight sentences.
The Bright Lamp Commentary lists these in detail. Now I briefly record the main points. Now, regarding the various sentences that exist within the phrase "up to," Collected Records says: Yup says: lacking three, there are fifty-six; lacking four, there are thirty-five; lacking five, there are twenty; lacking six, there are ten [etc.]. Should this be calculated based on the principle of twenty-eight sentences when lacking two? [The commentary saying "lacking three has fifty-five" - the character "five" is an error. Because it contradicts the total sum of one's own doctrine. Therefore fifty-six is the correct doctrine.] Also, Bright Lamp Commentary says: Question: Among the eight means of proof, cited examples are general. When cited examples are lacking, same and different are also lacking. Is it like "lacking two, there are twenty-eight"? Answer: When cited examples are lacking but same and different are not lacking, this refers to one part, not the complete part. Like "sound is permanent, being produced like space" - there are thesis, same-class, and cited example, but lacking cause, same-class, and cited example. Based on these meanings, there are twenty-eight sentences [etc.]. [Original inserted paper says: At the end it says: Regarding sentences where cited examples are lacking but same-class and different-class are not lacking, the various masters' laborious efforts are manifold. Their one or two explanations are as recorded in the table. Now also] [One interpretation says: Even if cited examples should not be lacking, if the proponent does not state them, this constitutes lacking. If so, why is there no such sentence? This should be considered.] Also Collected Records says: Zhou says: "Lacking two, there are twenty-eight," etc. - this is merely discussing methodology in general. Why? Cited examples are general. When cited examples are lacking, same and different are also lacking. Therefore this is not discussed. If following this principle, lacking one also does not constitute eight sentences. When cited examples are lacking, same and different are also immediately lacking. Abhidharma is the same - also cannot have sentences like lacking eight, etc. Combination-conclusion has no essence. When cause-example are lacking, corresponding to that they are also immediately lacking [etc.].

Various Ancient and Modern Interpretations of the Nature of Deficiency Faults

are detailed at the end of this volume. Also at the end of the lower volume, they are explained in detail. Those texts must be examined.

Ancient masters and Vasubandhu only relied on essence-less deficiency, taking complete deficiency as the count of sentences. However, they had not yet established essence-possessing deficiency. There are three interpretations for this.

Ancient Masters' Doctrine
Discussing the eight members of thesis, etc., and explaining deficiency faults. There are 166 sentences. [Marginal note: This number is determined by Yup's record as cited in Collected Records. It can be known by calculation.] The 166th sentence has all eight members lacking.

Ancient Masters' Doctrine
Regarding the four members of thesis, etc., explaining deficiency faults. There are fifteen sentences. The fifteenth sentence has all four members lacking.

Vasubandhu, etc.
Regarding three members, explaining deficiency faults. There are seven sentences. The seventh sentence has all three members lacking.

[Indented three characters]
All the above only explain essence-less deficiency, and take complete deficiency as the count of sentences.

After Bodhisattva Dignāga [Marginal note: After Dignāga, discussing both essence-possessing and essence-less regarding cause-one example-two, namely the three characteristics of cause, can be seen at the end of this volume and the end of the lower volume. Should be examined.]
Within essence-less deficiency, complete deficiency as sentence count is entirely not permitted. However, essence-possessing deficiency is also added. That is, based on the three characteristics of cause, deficiency faults are explained. Regarding the presence or absence of complete deficiency sentences within this present essence-possessing deficiency, there are three explanations.

Bodhisattva Dignāga
According to the present commentary text, Bodhisattva Dignāga says cause-one example-two, having six faults [...] there is none lacking three. In Dignāga's intention, regarding essence-possessing deficiency, he still does not permit the seventh sentence. According to the note in the above text explaining means of proof saying "because of departing from seven, etc.," in the correct doctrine's intention, speaking of essence-possessing deficiency, the seventh sentence seems to be permitted. Examining both above and below together, within Dignāga's correct doctrine, are there perhaps two interpretations? One says: In essence-possessing deficiency, there are only six sentences. One says: In essence-possessing deficiency, the seventh sentence is permitted.

Master Bhadanta
Within essence-possessing deficiency, completely does not permit the seventh sentence.

Other Various Masters
Within essence-possessing deficiency, uniformly permit seven sentences.

Question: After Dignāga, why is the essence-less deficiency seventh sentence completely not permitted?
Answer: The commentary explanation says: Taking thesis-cause-example as three as means of proof. If completely lacking, then it is not means of proof. Since originally without essence, what constitutes means of proof? What is there to be lacking to obtain the name "fallacious"? [etc.] The meaning says: First, deficiency faults are fault-revealing refutation within means of refutation. Moreover, means of refutation must have corresponding means of proof to examine and cause them to fall into fallacy. Now the three members are all lacking. What means of proof is there? Since means of proof already lacks essence, what is there to be lacking? [meaning].

[Lower Section]
Question: After Dignāga, what is the meaning of the doctrine permitting essence-possessing deficiency's seventh sentence? Answer: The commentary explanation says: Cause-one example-two, namely the three characteristics of cause. Although stating the thesis, not stating cause-example. Like Sāṅkhya practitioners who hold the self as thought, not stating cause-example. Is this not a fault? Also, although having words, the three characteristics are all lacking. Like sound-theorists who, opposing Buddhist practitioners, establish sound as permanent. Because of being support of qualities. Like cessation through discrimination. All non-permanent things are not supports of qualities. Like the four great elements. Though this quality-support has what is explained, the three characteristics are all lacking. How can it not be fallacious? Through this, the seventh is also a deficiency-diminishment fault [etc.]. This presents two categories within the doctrine permitting the seventh sentence.

"Although stating thesis" means: without words and the three characteristics all lacking, this constitutes the seventh sentence. Though cause completely lacks word-characteristics, since thesis still exists, it differs from essence-less complete deficiency. Therefore it constitutes sentence count. Also "although having words," etc. means: having words but the three characteristics all lacking constitutes the seventh sentence. Though the three characteristics are completely absent, words for all three members exist. Therefore it constitutes sentence count. [Having thesis but lacking cause-example corresponds to lacking-two in essence-less deficiency.]

Question: How do the three characteristics all lack in the cause "because of being quality-support"?
Answer: Sound belongs to the quality category. It is not quality-support. Quality-support refers to the substance category. The four great elements belong to the substance category. Cessation through discrimination is also not quality-support. Therefore the three characteristics all lack.

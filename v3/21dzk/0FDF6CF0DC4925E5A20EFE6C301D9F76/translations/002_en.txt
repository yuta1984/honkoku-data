The substance has real existence as the nature of rope. The principle of perfect accomplishment is like that straw. The dharmas of other-dependence are like that rope. What is discriminated and attached is like that snake. Among these, one should especially keep in mind and thoroughly contemplate the characteristics of other-dependence.

The colors, forms, fragrances, and tastes of all things that exist in the world, and even human minds, are all like dreams, illusions, dew, and lightning—empty and provisional. Thus all things cannot exist by themselves but arise in dependence upon conditions.

Therefore, blue appears to be blue but is not truly blue. Yellow appears to be yellow but is not truly yellow. Everything is like this. The minds of ordinary beings are crude and think these are truly existing things. From this error, events arise: desires for things, anger, pride, and doubt. If one thoroughly contemplates this principle, one will naturally know that discriminated attachment has no substantial nature, realize that the principle of perfect accomplishment is real, and all afflictions and evil karma will be destroyed. This is called "Eliminating the False and Preserving the Real Consciousness-Only." The remaining four levels are omitted here. One should consult other commentaries.

These three—discriminated, other-dependent, and perfectly accomplished—are called the dharma gate of the Three Natures. When these Three Natures are explained in detail, there are the Hundred Dharmas and Two Selflessnesses. The Hundred Dharmas means that other-dependent nature specifically contains ninety-four dharmas, and perfectly accomplished nature contains six types of unconditioned dharmas. These are called the Hundred Dharmas.

The Two Selflessnesses refer to the two aspects of the emptiness of discriminated attachment: the selflessness of persons (pudgala) and the selflessness of dharmas.

The ninety-four dharmas of other-dependence consist of eight mind-kings and six categories of mental factors. When explained in detail, there are fifty-one mental factors, eleven form dharmas, and twenty-four factors not associated with mind, totaling ninety-four.

The eight mind-kings are: First, eye-consciousness, the mind that sees forms. Second, ear-consciousness, the mind that hears sounds. Third, nose-consciousness, the mind that smells fragrances. Fourth, tongue-consciousness, the mind that knows tastes. Fifth, body-consciousness, the mind that knows bodily contact as hot or cool, soft or rough. Sixth, mental consciousness, the mind of the boundless dharma realm that contemplates all things seen and heard, and even things unseen and unheard.

Seventh is manas-consciousness. The depths of ordinary beings' minds are constantly turbid, and even when the previous six consciousnesses arise clearly, they do not lose the discriminative attachment to "my body" and "my possessions." That the depths of mind are as if perpetually intoxicated is due to this manas-consciousness.

Eighth is ālaya-consciousness. This is the root of all dharmas. It is the mind that contains and holds the seeds of all dharmas. Without this mind, who would hold the seeds of all dharmas? Without something to hold and contain them, the seeds of all dharmas would be lost. If there were no seeds, from what would they arise? The previous seven consciousnesses cannot hold seeds. The detailed principles and scriptural texts are omitted here.

Regarding these eight consciousnesses, the first six consciousnesses sometimes do not arise. Their conditions vary, but when a person sleeps deeply and dreams, the five consciousnesses of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body all do not arise. What one thinks of as seeing, hearing, and tasting in dreams is all discrimination by the sixth mental consciousness, not the arising of the five consciousnesses. When one sleeps so deeply as not to dream, mental consciousness also ceases, and only manas-consciousness and ālaya-consciousness remain.

Therefore, these two consciousnesses never cease to arise. Whether at birth or death, awake or asleep, they continue for long periods without interruption. That these two consciousnesses exist is extremely difficult to know. Among them, ālaya-consciousness is extremely profound. For this reason, it is not taught in the shallow teachings of the Hīnayāna. It is taught only in such sūtras as the Avataṃsaka, Saṃdhinirmocana, Laṅkāvatāra, and Ghanavyūha, and in such treatises as the Yogācāra, Prakaraṇa, Pramāṇa-samuccaya, Vijñapti-mātra, and Daśabhūmi.

These eight consciousnesses are the foundation within mind, hence they are called mind-kings. These eight kings have many retinues, called mental factors (caitasika). Specifically, they are called "dharmas possessed by mind," abbreviated as "mental factors." Though these are also mind, the various detailed aspects of mind are treated as mind's retinues.

There are six categories. First is universal (sarvatraga). This has five factors. Though called five different ones, they are called "universal" because they necessarily exist everywhere whenever mind arises.

Second is object-determining (viniyata). This also has five. These five each condition separate objects, hence called "object-determining." "Object" refers to dharmas known by mind. "Conditioning" refers to knowing things.

Third is wholesome (kuśala). This has eleven. Generally speaking, regarding the nature of form and mind dharmas, there are again three natures: wholesome nature, unwholesome nature, and ethically neutral nature. "Ethically neutral" refers to nature that is neither good nor evil. These eleven mental factors are necessarily wholesome in nature, hence called "wholesome."

Fourth is afflictions (kleśa). This has six, or ten when explained in detail. These ten are called "afflictions" because they trouble and torment the body and mind of sentient beings.

Fifth is secondary afflictions (upakleśa). This has twenty. These twenty are called "secondary afflictions" because they are derivatives and types of afflictions.

Sixth is indeterminate (aniyata). This has four. These four are called "indeterminate" because their nature regarding good and evil, where they exist, and how they accompany mind-kings are all indeterminate.

Five in universal, five in object-determining, eleven in wholesome, six in afflictions, twenty in secondary afflictions, four in indeterminate—totaling fifty-one mental factors. Their names are all explained in the Śatadharmā Treatise.

The mental factor of attention (manaskāra) is the mind that alerts and causes mind to arise. The mental factor of contact (sparśa) is the mind that makes mind touch well what it should know. The mental factor of sensation (vedanā) is the mind that receives pleasure, pain, mental sorrow and joy, or neither, in the mind. The mental factor of perception (saṃjñā) is that which particularly knows and discerns the forms of things and their various names.

are included in the sensation mental factor among the omnipresent mental factors. Also, the unconditioned that manifests when conception and sensation do not arise is called "cessation of conception and sensation unconditioned." "Conception" refers to the conception mental factor among the previously mentioned omnipresent mental factors. "Sensation" refers to the sensation mental factor itself. Generally, this mental factor has what are called the "five sensations," with five positions: distressed sensation, painful sensation, joyful sensation, pleasant sensation, and neutral sensation. Distressed sensation means receiving sorrow in the mind, not yet reaching bodily suffering. Joyful sensation means receiving delight in the mind, not yet reaching bodily pleasure. Neutral sensation is the mind that perceives and knows what exists when it is neither pleasant nor painful, neither distressed nor joyful. Painful sensation and pleasant sensation were mentioned earlier. Now, "not arising sensation" means that all these five sensations do not arise. These five unconditioned are all suchness. The dharma-nature that stands upon and manifests the unconditioned is truly constant like suchness, hence it is called "suchness unconditioned." This is called the six unconditioned. Within true ultimate meaning, even the name "suchness" is still a provisionally explained name. The true dharma-nature cannot be called existent, cannot be called empty, cannot be called suchness—because it is inconceivable, because it transcends the path of language. Now, sometimes non-associated factors are established upon this unconditioned, but I will omit this.

Generally, there are eight mind-kings, fifty-one mental factors, eleven form factors, twenty-four non-associated factors, and six unconditioned factors, totaling one hundred dharmas. The Hundred Dharmas Treatise lists the names of these hundred dharmas and the two selflessnesses. The two selflessnesses were mentioned in various ways earlier. Also, what was earlier called "selflessness of persons" refers to emptying the characteristics of self. The characteristics of self are the characteristics perceived to exist before self-attachment. Self-attachment refers to the mind that, regarding sentient beings—whether human, horse, or cattle—strongly grasps the existence of things with such minds as truly existent, and strongly conceives of distinctions between self and others. This is thinking mistaken things.

The reason is that what we call "person" is merely the coming together of various forms and minds. Length and shortness, square and round, fine and coarse are also types of form. How much more so blue, yellow, red, white, sound, smell, taste, and touch. From head to feet, from skin to bones, it is merely the coming together of these. There is no form of person beyond this. For example, when lumber comes together it is called a house, but there is no thing called "house" beyond the lumber. The human body is like this. Beyond the coming together of many minds and many forms, there is nothing. Understanding this is called selflessness of persons. The mind that grasps each individual essence of the many forms and minds that have come together as definitely being real things is called dharma-attachment. This too is mistaken. The reason is that these dharmas all arise from causal conditions, emerge from predominant conditions, are drawn by immediately preceding conditions, and are drawn by object conditions. Not one exists as a self. They all rely on the power of others. "Others" refers to conditions. Those conditions are also not separate things—they are precisely

these dharmas. Or the various dharmas mutually create each other. Since they all exist through the power of others like this, there is no way they can be called existent. For example, when a very poor person exists in the world relying on others' help, there is no way this can be called truly existing in the world. The various dharmas of form and mind also seem to exist like this, but in truth they are non-existent. Speaking this way is called dharma-selflessness. When one well realizes the two selflessnesses, the principle of suchness manifests. Because suchness is without characteristics, one must contemplate emptiness to manifest it. It is not that the principle of suchness is empty. Though we say it is not empty, there is nothing existing as that thing. Though we say there is nothing existing as that thing, its nature is also suchness. In essence, what we call the principle of suchness refers to only the truth of the principle of things. The dharmas are sustained by principle. If there were no principle, how could the dharmas exist? For this reason, suchness is the nature of the dharmas. This is the unconditioned, the perfectly realized. The other-dependent is the characteristics of dharmas. Characteristics are the conditioned, substantial matters. Those substantial matters are not suchness. Though they seem to exist, there are no real substantial matters. Thinking these are real and grasping essence and function is the two attachments to self and dharmas. Removing these is the two selflessnesses. Therefore, the two selflessnesses are established to cut off the false attachments upon the hundred dharmas.

Now, looking at these hundred dharmas, the principle of consciousness-only is still hard to believe. The reason is that consciousness properly refers to mind-kings. Beyond mind-kings there are already mental factors, form dharmas, non-associated factors, and unconditioned factors. How can this be only one mind? The way to resolve this doubt is: mental factors are equally mind. As companions of mind-kings, they do not exist outside mind-kings. Form dharmas are transformations of mind and mental factors and are not separate from them. Non-associated factors are conceptual divisions of form and mind, so they are not separate from mind. Unconditioned factors are the true nature of form, mind, and non-associated factors, so they are not separate from mind-kings. Therefore, everything is consciousness-only. Among these, the way form dharmas are called transformations of mind and mental factors is as follows: the eight consciousness mind-kings and fifty-one mental factors mentioned earlier each have four divisions. The four divisions are: objective division, subjective division, self-witnessing division, and witnessing-self-witnessing division. Eye consciousness has these four divisions, and even ālaya consciousness has these four divisions. The fifty-one mental factors are likewise. Among these, what is called the self-witnessing division is the true essence of mind. The remaining three divisions are functions of mind. Function refers to the capabilities inherent in essence. The so-called objective division is the capability of knowing among capabilities. Mind as a thing has no other aspect besides knowing objects. If there were no objects to know, what would be known? Based on this, the essence of mind transforms and becomes the objects to be known. This function of knowing is called the objective division. The various form dharmas exist within this objective division. Therefore, form dharmas are not separate from mind. The subjective division is the function that knows this objective division well. The knowing...

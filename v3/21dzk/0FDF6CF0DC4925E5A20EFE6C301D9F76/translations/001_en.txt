Two-Volume Commentary, Volume One
Written by Monk Ryōhen of the Hossō School

Generally speaking, in the teachings of our school, establishing the dharma gates means distinguishing the doctrinal categories. I shall briefly record the cultivation practices of the five stages concerning Consciousness-Only, Three Natures, One Hundred Dharmas, Four Conditions, Four Divisions, Seeds, Five Nature-Types, Karmic Actions and Their Results, as they appear.

First, all dharmas do not depart from our mind. The great ocean, rivers, Mount Sumeru, the iron-encircling mountains, unknown pure lands and bodhi of other worlds, and even the sublime principle of the One Reality of True Suchness—all exist within our mind. How much more so our own body's head, eyes, hands, feet, clothing, food and drink, etc. To think they exist outside the mind is delusion. Due to this delusion, we have become beings transmigrating in birth and death since beginningless time. If we know that all dharmas do not depart from the mind, birth-death transmigration will be eternally severed, and we will certainly attain the position of the Supreme Enlightened King.

Therefore, the forms that everyone thinks exist outside the mind are all dharmas completely without substantial nature. To cling to mind as real is also delusion, because one places mind outside of mind through attachment. To cling to emptiness as real is also delusion, because one sees the characteristics of emptiness outside the mind.

Thus, the characteristics perceived as existing outside the mind—whether form or mind, existence or non-existence—are all not real dharmas. Eliminating and losing these mistaken forms, generating inconceivable wisdom, and awakening to the one mind within is called the true contemplation of Consciousness-Only.

This has five levels. The first, called "Eliminating the False and Preserving the Real Consciousness-Only," states that within this inconceivable one mind, there is nature and there are characteristics. Nature is True Suchness, the sublime principle. This is called the Perfectly Accomplished Nature because it is perfectly fulfilled and originally unmoved. Characteristics are conditioned dharmas. These are called Other-Dependent Arising because they are characteristics that arise dependently upon other conditions over True Suchness.

Namely, form, sound, smell, taste, touch, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, the various inner minds, material resources, tools, dwellings, gardens and fields, mountains and forests, rivers and seas, etc. The substantial appearance that appears before one who fails to realize these false characteristics and definitely thinks they truly exist is called "Discriminated and Attached." This is a completely non-existent dharma. This is precisely the mistaken form of "mind being external" that I mentioned earlier. Because it is what the deluded mind that thinks pervasively and transitorily clings to, it is called "Discriminated and Attached."

For example, when seeing a rope and thinking it is a snake, there are three aspects. The nature of the rope is straw. It is a form that arises dependently upon hands, feet, etc. as conditions over the straw. That form extremely resembles a snake. Due to this, people sometimes mistakenly think it is a snake. That snake form is merely a reflection in the mind of the person who is mistaken, completely without substantial nature. That snake form arises from conditions and seems to exist falsely, but it is not a real substance. The real nature is straw. The characteristics of snake and rope exist falsely, while straw...

Mañjuśrī resides in the stage of near-enlightenment. How could he be incapable of seeing Wonderful Sound?

Answer: That bodhisattva came, saying "let me be able to see." Both matters are what is requested. If not so, why place the two characters "ling de" (let obtain)? However, according to reality, although he could see by his own power, the Tathāgata's actions are difficult to fathom. Therefore he begs for the Buddha's assistance. Even if this is a manifestation according to that [example], thinking to see Prabhūtaratna, in reality it must depend on the Buddha's power.

Question: When Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound came to this realm, could he see World-Honored Prabhūtaratna? There are arguments on both sides. If he could see, looking at the sūtra text, Śākyamuni spoke to Prabhūtaratna saying "This Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva wishes to meet." Prabhūtaratna merely praised "Excellent, excellent" and did not say he would manifest his body. Sometimes it explains "making offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha and Prabhūtaratna Buddha's stupa," sometimes it describes "seeing Śākyamuni Buddha and seeing Prabhūtaratna Buddha's stupa." From this we know that regarding Śākyamuni, he directly beheld the Buddha's body, but regarding Prabhūtaratna, he only saw the jeweled stupa. If following this, other teachers' proofs of "revering stupa not Buddha" and "requesting to see only hearing" are not permitted by our school. How is this?

Resolving: The Doctrinal Decision explains the inadmissibility of the "requesting to see only hearing proof," saying: "Mañjuśrī requested to see Wonderful Sound, but the sūtra does not praise Wonderful Sound's arrival. Mañjuśrī obtained seeing. Should Mañjuśrī also truly not have beheld Wonderful Sound? If having already requested to see, when he comes one immediately obtains seeing, what need is there for explanation? When Wonderful Sound requests to see, he should immediately see. Why is it necessary for the text to explain obtaining sight? Therefore it is inadmissible." Considering this meaning, the great sage's three karmas all avoid being without benefit

and have benefit. From the tenth ground onwards, they gradually perfect this virtue. How much more so for near-enlightenment? Since Wonderful Sound already spoke out, entreating the Buddha and begging to see Prabhūtaratna, how could there be joy yet ultimately no permission? If based on the text not explaining it, one definitively determines he did not see, then there is no text of Mañjuśrī seeing Wonderful Sound. How could the Awakened Mother, though requesting, have Wonderful Sound consequently hide? Since this matter is not so, that should also be the same.

Further inquiry: Though Bodhisattva Akṣayamati entreated Prabhūtaratna requesting to return to his original land, Prabhūtaratna did not return until the sūtra's end. If the great sage's words must be fulfilled, why did Prabhūtaratna not quickly depart? Answer: Since the main section was already completed, therefore Akṣayamati requested to return. It was not without significance. However, since Śākyamuni already announced "wait a moment," Mañjuśrī brought forth the ocean assembly, manifesting the sūtra's swift power. Those various chapters arose in sequence. Prabhūtaratna often served as witness. Therefore, though Akṣayamati made a provisional request, Prabhūtaratna still remained, all having reasons. Moreover, there is sincere text, and regarding Wonderful Sound requesting to see Prabhūtaratna, there is absolutely no reason for not seeing. Therefore it cannot serve as a parallel example.

Question: When Wonderful Sound returned to his original land, it only says "saw the stupa." This difficulty has not been completely addressed. How so? Answer: Śākyamuni is a present Buddha, therefore he does not dwell in a stupa. Prabhūtaratna had already passed into extinction, and his remaining bodily relics dwelling in the stupa emerged, therefore this matter differs from the ordinary. Returning to his original land, he should most appropriately report this matter. If residing and saying "only saw Prabhūtaratna Buddha" without seeing the stupa, it would seem not to exhaust the matter. Among these, when Wonderful Sound came to this land, he transmitted his original land Buddha's inquiry: "Is Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna present in the seven-jeweled stupa, coming to hear the Dharma?"

When returning to his original land, he should most appropriately report whether the jeweled stupa existed. Generally in the Entrustment Sūtra, lands again return to defilement, Prabhūtaratna vainly closes the stupa and dwells thus. Various establishments all add meaning outside the text. Therefore they labor to produce discriminations. Our school accords well with text and meaning, therefore casually speaking of "Prabhūtaratna's stupa" or calling the "Buddha's name" are all without contradiction.

The Xuanzan states: Regarding the sūtra passage "World-Honored One, I now... show me and let me see." The commentary says: Though Prabhūtaratna and Śākyamuni sit together in the stupa, spiritual power conceals and obscures, causing him not to see, therefore he requests to see him.

The Doctrinal Choices Record states: The commentary's "Prabhūtaratna and Śākyamuni... seeing him" explains the reason for requesting to see. Also Liu states: Wonderful Sound seeking to see Prabhūtaratna is like Mañjuśrī seeking to see Wonderful Sound, being aided by Prabhūtaratna and achieving success. Wonderful Sound requesting to observe Prabhūtaratna obtains penetration through Śākyamuni. This will illuminate that "without stillness one cannot manifest movement, without movement one cannot reveal stillness."

The Water Commentary states: Question: The two Buddhas sit together in one stupa. Why does Wonderful Sound see Śākyamuni but not see Prabhūtaratna Buddha? Answer: Cause and effect are different. Due to the Buddha's spiritual power, he does not let him see.

The Doctrinal Decision states: Six: The "wanting to see Prabhūtaratna proof" is inadmissible. If saying "two Buddhas sit together" immediately causes both to be seen, what need is there to request the Buddha? "I now wish to see Prabhūtaratna Buddha" - bodhisattvas are inferior beings, Tathāgatas are superior fruits. With assistance enabling seeing, one can behold the honored one. If not yet assisted, then one cannot see. Hoping for the Buddha's power, therefore requesting to want to see. Moreover, when Wonderful Sound was about to come, Mañjuśrī still requested the Buddha's assistance. When Wonderful Sound already appeared, being in the causal position he obtained seeing. Buddha's power is necessarily required. Therefore though sitting together, only after requesting could he see. This is not that requesting to see immediately proves

the stupa is closed. Therefore it is inadmissible. Seven: The "requesting to see only hearing proof" is inadmissible. If by requesting to see, the sūtra only speaks of praise and does not explain seeing the body, then it clearly shows he did not see Prabhūtaratna. Moreover, Mañjuśrī requested to see Wonderful Sound, but the sūtra does not praise Wonderful Sound's arrival. Mañjuśrī obtained seeing. Should Mañjuśrī also truly not have beheld Wonderful Sound? If having already requested to see, when he comes one immediately obtains seeing, what need is there for explanation? When Wonderful Sound requests to see, he should immediately see. Why is it necessary for the text to explain obtaining sight? Therefore it is inadmissible.

Question: The sūtra text states "Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound manifested various bodies to teach the Dharma." How many types of bodies did he manifest? The commentary states "he manifested eighteen types of bodies." Regarding this, looking at the sūtra from beginning to end, there are altogether twenty types of bodies. Namely, six types of heavenly bodies, eleven types of human bodies, eight divisions, three evil destinies, and royal palace women's bodies. Why say "eighteen types"?

Resolving: Looking at the sūtra text, "manifesting various bodies, teaching this sūtra for sentient beings everywhere. Sometimes manifesting Brahmā king's body up to human and non-human bodies, and teaching this sūtra" clarifies manifesting eighteen types of bodies. "All the hells... up to transforming into women's bodies and teaching this sūtra" is a separate section clarifying that the three destinies and royal palaces teach this sūtra. The above various types all have the words "sometimes manifesting," but the later section lacks this text. We know that the transformative [bodies] of the three destinies are included in the previously mentioned bodies. Moreover, describing "transforming into women's bodies" does not separate from the above types. Therefore there is no fault.

The sūtra states:

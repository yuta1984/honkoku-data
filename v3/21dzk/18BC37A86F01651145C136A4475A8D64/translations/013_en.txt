Lotus Sūtra Volume Seven Revelation Commentary (Wonderful Sound Chapter, third of three fascicles)
　　　Wonderful Sound Chapter

Question: Should this chapter demonstrate the power of ascetic practices in the conduct of teaching and converting sentient beings? The Xuanzan quotes the Lotus Treatise saying it "demonstrates the power of practicing ascetic practices." Regarding this, looking at the entire chapter from beginning to end, it clarifies the aspects of Wonderful Sound's arrival and explains the matter of manifesting bodies to preach Dharma, but there is no text at all demonstrating the power of practicing ascetic practices. By what does the treatise author say it "demonstrates the power of ascetic practices in teaching and converting sentient beings"?

Resolving: The power of ascetic practices in teaching and converting sentient beings means encouraging sentient beings to practice asceticism. The Xuanzan sometimes says "encouraging others in ascetic practice" and sometimes says "teaching the practice of asceticism." Wonderful Sound manifests eighteen types of bodies and circulates the One Vehicle for various sentient beings. If those converted sentient beings practice asceticism, this can be called Wonderful Sound's power of ascetic practices in teaching and converting sentient beings. Though the sūtra actually lacks text about making them practice asceticism, since the treatise author already states that the power of practicing asceticism is demonstrated in both the Medicine King chapter and Wonderful Sound chapter, though hidden in the sūtra text, the wisdom of propagating the sūtra deeply explores the true meaning. One should not strongly doubt this. Great Master Chishō states: "Now for the sake of teaching and converting, entering various difficult places is considered ascetic practice." Jiaxiang also resembles this. The intention of these masters is that Wonderful Sound, like Medicine King, practices asceticism himself. However, the Xuanzan divides into self and other practices. The meaning is as before. The treatise states: "The power of practicing asceticism demonstrates teaching and converting sentient beings, therefore shown in the Medicine King Bodhisattva chapter. Also, the power of practicing asceticism demonstrates teaching and converting sentient beings, therefore shown in the Wonderful Sound chapter."

The Xuanzan states: "Regarding the reason for coming, the treatise says: The power of ascetic practices in teaching and converting sentient beings is demonstrated in the Wonderful Sound chapter. Wonderful Sound exists in the Eastern land and secretly dwells in this realm, originally transmitting the Lotus teaching and practicing asceticism. Now he emits light to gather assemblies, showing the multitudes, encouraging supreme aspiration, and propagating the sūtra teachings, therefore this chapter comes."

It also states: "Resolving objections: Why is it necessary to summon Wonderful Sound to make this chapter? Answer: Medicine King practices asceticism in this realm and personally encourages sentient beings. There has not yet been encouragement and preaching by a superior person from another land. Therefore Wonderful Sound is summoned. He practices Dharma from afar and encourages others in ascetic practice, therefore it is necessary to summon him."

The Doctrinal Commentary states: "Explaining the power of practicing asceticism, there are generally two chapters. Question: Medicine King can be called ascetic practice, but how is the Wonderful Sound chapter ascetic practice? Answer: Wonderful Sound divides his form among the four births and six paths, propagating the sūtra for beings and rescuing them from various difficulties. This is also ascetic practice."

Commentary on the Treatise, Volume Ten, states: "Regarding the treatise's 'power of ascetic practices in teaching and converting sentient beings that Wonderful Sound demonstrates': Taking the teaching and converting of sentient beings as ascetic practice. The sūtra says: 'In all places of hell, hungry ghosts, and various difficulties, all are rescued and freed from suffering.' It does not say 'preaching the sūtra' because first, the suffering is severe, and second, the obstructions are deep. It only clarifies rescue. The previous chapter took burning the body as ascetic practice. Now taking entering various difficult places for the sake of teaching and converting as the distinction."

Question: The sūtra text states "At that time Śākyamuni Buddha emitted the light of the great person's characteristic flesh-mound," etc. In that case,

can the white-tuft characteristic be called a great person's characteristic? There are two aspects. If it can be called a great person's characteristic, looking at the sūtra text, it "emits the light of the great person's characteristic flesh-mound" and "emits the light of the white-tuft characteristic between the eyebrows." Clearly one knows that only the flesh-mound light is called the great person's characteristic. Moreover, in the Great Treatise, the flesh-mound seamless crown characteristic establishes the great person's characteristic. Apart from this there is nothing else separately obtainable. If relying on this, then the great person's characteristic is the characteristic possessed by great persons. Why does it not extend to the white-tuft characteristic? Therefore the Saddharma-puṇḍarīka states: "Immediately from the great person's characteristic between the eyebrows,演出 hundreds of thousands of lights." How so?

Resolving: The name "great person's characteristic" should apply to the white-tuft characteristic. Therefore the Sūtra on Ascending to Birth states: "Bodhisattva Maitreya emits the light of the great person's white-tuft characteristic between the eyebrows." Relying on the text and considering it, on the great being's face there is this excellent characteristic, with brilliant illumination expressing noble virtue. It should especially be called a great person's characteristic. However, regarding the sūtra text, though both flesh-mound and white-tuft are great person's characteristics, the flesh-mound has the supreme position and surpasses other characteristics, so perhaps the general is used for the particular. Since Buddha emits this light to summon great beings from other lands, perhaps he specifically indicates one characteristic. Or the name "great person's characteristic" generally covers the following two characteristics. The meaning is: among great person's characteristics, the flesh-mound and between-eyebrows characteristics. Next, regarding the Yogācāra text, among the thirty-two characteristics, it takes the uṣṇīṣa (flesh-mound) and combines it with the invisible crown as one type, explaining why no distinction is established. Therefore it says "apart from this there is nothing else separately obtainable." It does not say "great person's characteristics have nothing outside the invisible crown characteristic." Moreover, the above text already expresses "all such thirty-two types of great person characteristics." How could it be limited to the one flesh-mound characteristic? Generally, sometimes called "great person

characteristics" and sometimes called "great person characteristics" - these are the same name. That the name "great person characteristics" applies to the thirty-two characteristics is clear in the original treatise text. Among them, discussing superiority, there are the two characteristics of flesh-mound and white-tuft. Among the two characteristics, the invisible crown characteristic is still most superior. Others cannot see it at all. Therefore one should appropriately reconcile various texts. Perhaps this can be known by following Tiantai's explanation.

The sūtra states: "At that time Śākyamuni Buddha emitted the light of the great person's flesh-mound characteristic and emitted the light of the white-tuft characteristic between the eyebrows, universally illuminating the eastern direction's 108 million koṭis of nayutas of Ganges sand Buddha worlds."

The Personal Commentary states: "Question: When Śākyamuni summons Wonderful Sound by emitting the light of the great person's flesh-mound characteristic, why is this not called a great person's characteristic? Answer: The Xuanzan does not explain. A certain master explains: The great person's characteristic is the great characteristic ocean. The merit of hair all over the body does not match the merit of one minor mark. The merit of all minor marks does not match the merit of one major characteristic. The merit of all characteristics, going from lower to higher, progressively surpass each other but do not match the merit of the white-tuft. The merit of the white-tuft does not match the merit of the flesh-mound. Therefore this is the great person's characteristic."

Yogācārabhūmi Volume 49 states: "All such thirty-two types of great person characteristics have no distinctions. Know that they all use pure precepts as cause and can be obtained through merit. Know that here on the crown appear the uṣṇīṣa (flesh-mound) and the Tathāgata's invisible crown characteristic, together establishing one type of great person characteristic. Apart from this there is nothing else separately obtainable."

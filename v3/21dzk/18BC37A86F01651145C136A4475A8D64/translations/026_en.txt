For a hundred kalpas wholeheartedly taking refuge, calling names, reciting, bowing, and making offerings, seeking various wishes and quickly attaining fulfillment. Though words again speak of "arousing the mind" in sūtras, ultimate mind-arousal is difficult to accomplish. Comparing buddhas and bodhisattvas to distinguish superior and inferior has never existed. In the commentary calling them buddhas - is this also not a contradiction?

The Eleven-Faced Sūtra states: "If there are those who invoke the names of hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of buddhas, and again there are those who for a brief time wholeheartedly invoke my name, those two merits are equal."

The commentary on the same sūtra states: "The sūtra's 'World-Honored One... equal' is the third授量 of merit. Since buddhas and bodhisattvas already differ in cause and effect, how can the merit of invoking names be equal? The explanation gives two meanings: First, other-realm buddhas have karmic connections in other realms but no opportunity in this land. Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara has karmic connections in this land, so the two merits are equal without difference. Second, using non-duality: buddhas have many karmic connections in other realms so their merit is abundant; Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara has karmic connections in this land so his blessings are abundant. Using non-duality: buddhas have one dharma-body essence, and this bodhisattva also has one dharma-body essence, therefore they are equally equal."

This commentary was obtained from the Eastern Pagoda Monastery. The reason the Zisheng Commentary exists at the Eastern Pagoda Monastery is recorded in the Eastern Pagoda Transmission of the Lamp Record. Perhaps it was composed by Master Zisheng?

Question: In the Xuanzan it states "Avalokiteśvara long ago became buddha." Is Avalokiteśvara's awakening actual awakening?
Both sides have problems. If it were actual awakening, the *Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra* states "for the sake of sentient beings, long transmigrating through birth and death without attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi," then gives examples including Avalokiteśvara and Mañjuśrī. From this we know past awakening is not actual awakening. Moreover, proclaiming awakening in the three times is known to be a matter of transformation-manifestation. If it is not actual awakening, looking at the specific text of the Xuanzan: "Avalokiteśvara long ago became buddha and does not abandon bodhisattva practices, therefore manifests as a bodhisattva." The meaning that buddhahood is real and bodhisattvahood is manifestation is clear. Moreover, the second interpretation is the meaning of using Avalokiteśvara to compare with 620 million Ganges sand buddhas. Accomplishing this meaning is because of long-ago buddhahood, hence equaling so many buddhas. If not actual awakening, the established position would be difficult to maintain. Why are both sides unclear?

Answer: Looking at the Xuanzan's meaning, because it is actual buddhahood, this is the reason for reconciling the commentary. Hence it also states: "Avalokiteśvara long ago became buddha and does not abandon bodhisattva practices - how could there be no comparison with the Tathāgata?" If it were transformation-manifestation, it would not suffice as proof. Moreover, since it already states "manifests as bodhisattva," we know buddhahood is real and bodhisattvahood is manifestation. However, the *Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra* discusses the gate of great compassion and describes the vow of icchantikas. Among past and present, the former should be considered actual awakening, while later instances are transformation-manifestations.

If following the doctrine that great compassion icchantikas do not become buddhas to reconcile the Xuanzan, one should say: "Other commentaries already explain that Avalokiteśvara long ago accomplished [buddhahood]. Following the present sūtra, comparing with buddha merit has no fault." If discussing reality, the two sūtras carry implicit meaning and do not contradict the doctrine of non-accomplishment through great compassion.

The Xuanzan is as stated above.

Question: Regarding the doctrine of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara manifesting bodies and teaching Dharma, should bodhisattva bodies be manifested?
Both sides have problems. If manifested, though the sūtra text lists thirty-three types of bodies, it does not mention bodhisattva bodies. Connecting to the Xuanzan's nineteen types of bodies, combined into eight categories, there are three holy bodies. If bodhisattva bodies were manifested, why not say there are four holy bodies? If not manifested, through the power of universal manifestation samādhi, bodies are manifested according to opportunities. If there are those who could be saved by seeing bodhisattva bodies, why not manifest them? Moreover, Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara already manifests bodhisattva bodies - how could Avalokiteśvara not do so? Following this, in the *Saddharma-puṇḍarīka* it states: "Sometimes manifesting bodhisattva forms and characteristics, teaching sūtras and converting [beings]."

Answer: The three responding holy [bodies] are the actual bodies of the three vehicles. If in the Mahāyāna we divide into two categories of cause and effect, what hindrance is there to manifesting bodhisattva bodies? The *Saddharma-puṇḍarīka* and the Gadgadasvara chapter are precisely the meaning of opening the causal stage. Does this chapter combine cause with effect? Or because Avalokiteśvara is inherently a bodhisattva, does it not speak of separate transformation-manifestations beyond the original body? Either way is without fault.

The *Yishu* states: "Now wanting to distinguish the meaning of the three vehicles, bodhisattva bodies are included in the Buddha Vehicle, so they are not mentioned."

*Saddharma-puṇḍarīka* fascicle 10 states: "In the worlds where Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara travels, sometimes manifesting buddha bodies to proclaim Dharma, sometimes manifesting bodhisattva forms and characteristics to teach sūtras and convert [beings], sometimes manifesting pratyekabuddhas..."

The Gadgadasvara chapter of the Wonderful Sūtra states: "For those who should be saved by bodhisattva form, [he] manifests bodhisattva form and teaches Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by buddha form, [he] immediately manifests buddha form and teaches Dharma for them."

Question: The sūtra text states "For those who should be saved by pratyekabuddha body, [he] immediately manifests pratyekabuddha body and teaches Dharma for them" - what does he teach? Answer: As the text states. Regarding this, provisional [teachings] necessarily lead to ultimate [truth] - this is the constant pattern. However, pratyekabuddhas completely do not teach Dharma. How can [one] manifest their bodies and teach Dharma?

The Bhaiṣajyarāja chapter commentary ends here.

Question: The necklace offered by Bodhisattva Akṣayamati - is it material giving or Dharma giving? Proceeding to say: The sūtra states "Accept this Dharma-giving precious jeweled necklace." Regarding this, teaching Dharma according to opportunities is called Dharma giving, as stated "Dharma giving means truthfully and without defilement explaining sūtras, etc." However, necklaces are adornments of dependent rewards. How can they be Dharma giving?

Answer: The Xuanzan explains the reason for Dharma giving, stating: "Because the giving accords with principle, because it is true and correct practice, because it seeks bodhi, it is called Dharma giving." According to this explanation, though giving material wealth, if done according to Dharma, there might also be the meaning of calling it Dharma giving. Hence the *Jueze ji* states: "This is giving according to Dharma, called Dharma giving, not teaching Dharma."

The *Jingshui chao* states: "Question: Why are jewels material giving yet called Dharma giving? Answer: The commentary says 'because giving accords with principle.' Question: What is called according with principle? Answer: The commentary says 'because it is true and correct practice.' Question: Why is it called true and correct practice? Answer: The commentary says 'Because it seeks bodhi, it is called Dharma giving.' Regarding this, explaining in sequence is good; various commentaries are not appropriate."

Lotus Sūtra Volume 8 Kaiji Commentary (Universal Gate Chapter - First of Three Fascicles)

　　　Universal Gate Chapter

Question: Should this chapter be considered the circulation section of this sūtra? Yes. Regarding this, circulation has three aspects: praise and reverence, study and practice, and entrustment and reception. These all expound the excellent virtues of the Lotus. Some praise the person and dharma as worthy of veneration and respect, some teach the primary and auxiliary practices for propagating this sūtra, and some show signs of entrustment, receiving commands for circulation. However, in this chapter, the name, causes, transformative activities, and merits of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva are explained, but there is no mention of the name "Lotus" at all. Why is it considered circulation?

Answer: The Xuanzan explains the meaning of this chapter's inclusion, saying: "Avalokiteśvara rescues beings who have not yet aroused the [bodhi]mind from difficulties, causes them to leave suffering, arouse the mind, and uphold the sūtra." It immediately quotes a treatise as evidence: "The power to rescue and protect beings from various difficulties refers to the manifestation of the Avalokiteśvara Dhāraṇī Chapter." If one encounters suffering and difficulties, there is no leisure to uphold sūtras. If one does not arouse the mind, there is no hope for cultivation. Through the bodhisattva's skillful means, those who have not yet left suffering are helped to leave that suffering, and those who have not yet aroused the mind are taught to arouse the bodhi mind. The path of propagation truly proceeds from this. The commentary also states: "Moreover, Avalokiteśvara has people recollect him to rescue from difficulties, and dhāraṇīs recite the dharma to rescue from difficulties. If the power of easy rescue is not added, it is feared that the task of upholding sūtras would be difficult to cultivate. Therefore, easy merit assists in accomplishing difficult tasks."

Seifū states: "When one recollects Avalokiteśvara, first one is freed from suffering, and second, since Avalokiteśvara's name appears in the Lotus Sūtra, recollecting Avalokiteśvara is precisely the practice of upholding the sūtra," etc. The general meaning is the same as the Xuanzan. According to the esoteric school's intention, Avalokiteśvara is the Lotus Sūtra itself. Regarding our school, there is secretly this meaning. It can be understood through investigation.

The Xuanzan states: "Regarding the meaning of this chapter's inclusion, a treatise states: 'The power to rescue and protect beings from various difficulties refers to the manifestation of the Avalokiteśvara Dhāraṇī Chapter.' Avalokiteśvara rescues beings who have not aroused the mind from difficulties, causing them to leave suffering, arouse the mind, and uphold the sūtra. Dhāraṇīs rescue those who have already aroused the mind and uphold sūtras from difficulties, causing them to leave suffering and uphold sūtras. Moreover, Avalokiteśvara uses the three supernatural powers of divine eye, divine ear, and knowledge of others' minds to protect sūtra-holders from difficulties. Dhāraṇīs have two sages, two devas, and ten spirits use bright mantras to protect sūtra-holders from difficulties. Moreover, Avalokiteśvara has people recollect to rescue from difficulties, dhāraṇīs recite dharma to rescue from difficulties. The power of upholding sūtras has already left various difficulties. If easy methods of rescue are not added, it is feared that the task of upholding sūtras would be difficult to cultivate. Therefore, easy merit assists in accomplishing difficult tasks, thereby encouraging sūtra-holding. Thus this chapter comes."

Kyōsui Commentary Volume 35 states: "Moreover, the meaning of this chapter's inclusion is most difficult. In the entire sūtra, only this chapter exists that does not mention the words 'Lotus Sūtra.' The reason is that when the World-Honored One expounded the sūtra, beings had not yet aroused the mind, and when suffering oppressed their bodies and they recollected Avalokiteśvara, first they were freed from suffering, and second, since Avalokiteśvara's name appears in this Lotus Sūtra, recollecting Avalokiteśvara precisely accomplishes the practice of sūtra-holding. Therefore, easy merit assists in accomplishing difficult tasks. Thus the treatise states: 'Protecting beings who have not aroused the mind from difficulties.' The meaning is that those who can uphold the sūtra can necessarily leave suffering. Truly, since the task of sūtra-holding is difficult to cultivate, if it is not assisted during the period before accomplishment, the meritorious practices will

not be accomplished. Therefore, auxiliary methods are added to assist in accomplishing difficult tasks."

The Xuanzan states: "There are three meanings for this chapter's inclusion. First, among the three circulations, these lower eight chapters are entrustment and reception circulation, showing signs of entrustment, receiving commands to practice. The Divine Powers and Entrustment chapters entrust and cause practice; the remaining six chapters receive commands and circulate. Second, according to the second classification, the first chapter above is the introductory section, the next nineteen chapters constitute the main doctrine, and these lower eight chapters are the circulation section. Divine Powers and Entrustment encourage faith through entrustment and reception; the latter six chapters receive commands and circulate. The tendency is the same as before. This will not be elaborated further below."

Question: Should Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva benefit beings who do not recollect him? It is stated that according to the Xuanzan, he does not benefit beings who do not recollect him. Regarding this, since equal compassion pervades the dharma realm, why would he discriminate against beings who do not recollect him? If he waits for reverent recollection to bestow benefits, how could this be the virtue of universal gate manifestation? Therefore, the commentator himself explains Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva's name as "unrequested friend." This is based on the Infinite Meanings Sūtra, which mentions Avalokiteśvara and others as "unrequested friends of these beings." Furthermore, looking at the sūtra text, when hundreds of thousands of beings encounter rakṣasa difficulties, if one person calls Avalokiteśvara's name, all people attain liberation. Are these not people who do not recollect him?

Answer: According to the principle of cause and effect, causes produce effects. When beings invite fortune and avoid suffering, this is all the power of their own karma. If they do not recollect Avalokiteśvara, what could serve as the cause for receiving his benefits? The Three Jewels' benefiting beings is all auxiliary conditions. Examining the primary cause, it is sentient beings' taking refuge in the Three Jewels, calling their names,

making offerings, and diligent cultivation through the three activities [of body, speech, and mind]. Beings who do not recollect have no causal basis in their own karma. How could they receive the auxiliary conditions of guidance and attraction? Regarding this, ordinary people and sages, the contaminated and uncontaminated, are mutually separated and do not communicate. Gradually approaching, they eventually merge. Hearing with the ears and reciting with the mouth is precisely the initial gate. Without reaching reverent recollection, benefits are difficult to have. Therefore the Xuanzan states: "Beings having no mind while Buddha rescues is what great sages cannot penetrate. Self-arousing intention while fearing conditions is what groups of beings commonly model. First depending on one's own karma, only afterwards relying on conditions. If one does not cultivate oneself, what can conditions accomplish? Therefore, waiting for reverent recollection, only then beginning rescue."

However, universal gate manifestation means the principle of equal compassion without discrimination and unobstructed sovereign virtue. Although the power of the teacher is capable, if the conditions for those to be saved are not prepared, this is not originally obstructed by him. Without waiting for beings' merit, if benefits were bestowed according to wishes, one great sage should quickly benefit all sentient beings. Who would miss out on those benefits? Remaining in saṃsāra until now... Next, being an "unrequested friend" discusses the bodhisattva's intentions. Even if one cultivates practices such as recitation, due to ignorance one has not yet understood the skillful means to escape suffering. The bodhisattva, depending on recollection, immediately becomes a good friend, able to show skillful means for liberation. This is not becoming a teacher-friend before recollection. Therefore the Xuanzan states: "Even if one cultivates by oneself, without understanding skillful means, one must depend on good friends to show how suffering ceases."

The Xuanzan states: "Question: Bodhisattva's great compassion observes suffering and immediately rescues. Why wait for recollection before extending compassion? Answer: Beings having no mind while Buddha rescues is what great sages cannot penetrate. Self-arousing intention and hoping for conditions is what groups of beings commonly model. First depending on one's own karma, only afterwards relying on conditions. Since one does not cultivate oneself, what can conditions accomplish? Therefore, waiting for reverent recollection, only then beginning rescue. Even if one cultivates by oneself, without understanding skillful means, one must depend on good friends"

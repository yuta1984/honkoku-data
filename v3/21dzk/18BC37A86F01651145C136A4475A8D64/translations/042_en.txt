The previously explained three grades of cultivation and birth merely present one aspect and do not exhaust the true principle. In true principle, within each of the ten dharma practices, there are all three grades. For example, just as the middle grade has "upholding through understanding meaning," the superior grade also has "individual cultivation practice," and because there are superior and inferior levels, in practicing as taught, each has lower and upper levels, etc. Through this one can understand the general outline.

The sutra states: (as above)

The Xuanzan states: The previously explained three grades of cultivation and birth merely present one aspect and do not exhaust the true principle. In true principle, within each of the ten dharma practices, there are all three grades. Just as the middle grade already has "upholding through understanding meaning," the superior grade also has "individual cultivation practice," and because there are superior and inferior levels, in practicing as taught, each has lower and upper levels. Now it merely explains that the middle grade exists while the superior grade does not. This is explained according to one aspect. Regarding the above ten dharma practices, the Discrimination of Middle and Extremes explains that the first eight are hearing wisdom as inferior grade, the ninth is contemplative wisdom as middle grade, and the tenth is meditative wisdom as superior grade. Within hearing wisdom, copying, making offerings, and giving to others are lower because they are easy; listening, reading, and reciting are middle; upholding and expounding are superior because they are difficult.

Question: In the Xuanzan, regarding distinguishing the different three grades of the ten dharma practices, why are giving to others, etc. made inferior grade, and upholding and expounding made superior grade? Answer: The commentary states "giving to others, etc. are inferior because they are easy; upholding and expounding are superior because they are difficult." Regarding this, looking at the above Xuanzan (Dharma Teacher Chapter), giving to others is difficult while upholding and explaining are easy. (Explaining means expounding.) This contradicts earlier and later passages. How should this be reconciled?

Explanation: The difficulty and ease of practices should be indefinite according to the person. If speaking about the foolish and wise, upholding and expounding are difficult because extensive texts are hard to maintain and profound principles are hard to expound. Giving to others, etc. are shallow, and since practitioners can also cultivate them, they are easy. If speaking about the poor and rich, giving to others is not easy. Comparing the two places, each describes one category.

The Xuanzan states: (as above)

Xuanzan volume 10 (Dharma Teacher Merit Chapter section) states: Speaking of reality, dharma teachers total ten types. This is a brief explanation... exemplifying the remaining offerings, giving to others, listening, contemplating, and cultivating. All are also dharma teachers. The first three are easy and not explained. The latter two are difficult and not explained. The middle five types are raised to exemplify difficulty and ease.

Volume 8 states: The six dharma teachers are: first, upholding; second, reading; third, reciting; fourth, explaining; fifth, copying; sixth, making offerings... First explaining six types. The remaining four types—transforming and giving, listening, contemplating, cultivating—should all be practiced but are not explained because they are difficult.

The Supreme Victory Commentary volume 4 states: From the sutra's "if someone" to "cannot reach." Commentary: The remaining two texts show dharma teachers have ten types. First raising the three practices of copying and reciting, speaking according to the middle position. Offerings and giving to others are inferior, while contemplating and cultivating, etc. are superior, so they are abbreviated and not mentioned.

Question: The sutra text states "When the Buddha spoke this sutra, Samantabhadra and other bodhisattvas... made prostrations and departed." Should this text exist in the Sanskrit original of this chapter? If it exists, according to our school's position, based on the Samantabhadra text and later chapter commentary, the Entrustment Chapter is placed after the Encouragement Chapter. If so, the sutra explanation has not yet concluded, so why

[Left Page, Upper Section]

is there text about making prostrations and departing? If based on this there is no such text, even if Kumārajīva obtained a defective Sanskrit manuscript and confused the order of the Entrustment Chapter, why would he arbitrarily place the text about making prostrations and departing at the end of this chapter? Certainly know that the Sanskrit original must have these words. Therefore in the Xuanzan, analyzing the textual sections of this chapter, the text "When the Samantabhadra Encouragement Chapter was spoken... making prostrations and departing" becomes the sixth section of the assembly obtaining benefits.

Explanation: According to our school's position, the Entrustment Chapter marks the end of the entire sutra, and the Samantabhadra Chapter should precede it. The treatise immediately permits a later chapter. Why does the assembly depart? Therefore know that the words "making prostrations and departing" should be at the end of the Entrustment Chapter. The translator polished and placed it in this chapter. Therefore the Tang dynasty Dharma Master Qifu's commentary states: "This is because the translation house held the Entrustment Chapter and placed it after the Supernatural Powers Chapter, so at the very end of this chapter it concludes the entire sutra text, therefore saying 'making prostrations and departing.' Since it is not the Buddha's words, why labor to cause confusion?"

Therefore in the Entrustment Chapter, when the Buddha spoke "Each Buddha should return to their places and the Abundant Treasures Buddha's stupa should return to its former state," the emanation bodies, Abundant Treasures, Viśiṣṭacāritra and other bodhisattvas, Śāriputra and other voice-hearers of the four assemblies, and all worlds greatly rejoiced at what the Buddha taught. (abbreviated excerpt) The textual appearance is without dispute. It is the time for the single assembly to roll up their seats. Receiving and upholding the Buddha's words, making prostrations and departing—is this not below this text? Although our own and other schools mutually reconcile one apparent contradiction, the relative importance and conformity or opposition are easily known when compared.

The single-fascicle Amoghapāśa Sūtra, in the thirty-fascicle version, generally corresponds to the Introduction Chapter. However, at its end it has "believing, receiving, and practicing accordingly." Like this example, it is the translator's standard practice. When Kumārajīva obtained the confused manuscript and placed the Encouragement

[Left Page, Lower Section]

at the sutra's end, how could he not consider future generations' doubts?

The sutra states: When this Samantabhadra Encouragement Chapter was spoken, immeasurable and limitless bodhisattvas equal to Ganges sands obtained billions of dhāraṇīs, and bodhisattvas equal to the dust motes of the three-thousand great thousand worlds perfected the Samantabhadra Way. When the Buddha spoke this sutra, Samantabhadra and other bodhisattvas, Śāriputra and other voice-hearers, and various gods, dragons, humans, non-humans, etc.—the entire great assembly all greatly rejoiced, received and upheld the Buddha's words, made prostrations and departed.

The Xuanzan states: From the sutra's "Speaking of this Samantabhadra" to "making prostrations and departing." Commentary: The chapter's sixth section. The assembly obtaining benefits has two parts: first obtaining benefits, then practicing accordingly.

The Jingshui Commentary states: Question: The sutra says "making prostrations and departing." The three roots, four assemblies, and eight groups all rise and descend. During the Entrustment Chapter, to whom is the entrustment given? Answer: This is because the translation house took the Entrustment Chapter and placed it after the Supernatural Powers Chapter, so at the very end of this chapter it concludes the entire sutra text, therefore saying "making prostrations and departing." Since it is not the Buddha's words, why labor to cause confusion?

The copied manuscript states:
All those connected with the Lotus have aspirations. The resident monks of this mountain are particularly diligent, but the circulation of ancient sages' excerpts is not extensive, and beginners may become discouraged. Now crossing through chapters, briefly recording questions and answers about fundamental matters, collecting essential excerpts. Deeply fearing mistakes, errors, and heterodox views, they should properly be revealed. I only wish that life after life, generation after generation, I may encounter the Great Sage and...

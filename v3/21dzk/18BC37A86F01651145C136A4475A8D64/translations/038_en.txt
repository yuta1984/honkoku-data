nature," then would it not be difficult for the doctrine of mutual dependence between conventional and ultimate truth to exist when entering the remainderless state?

I privately suggest that there should be two approaches of "neither one nor different." The self and dharmas explained in the sacred teachings, though provisional, are not non-existent. Speaking of "self" and "dharma," their characteristics do not become confused. Stream-enterers, once-returners, etc. are such selves. Among these provisional entities, they differ from one another. From beginningless time up to Buddhahood, conditioned and unconditioned reward bodies are naturally differentiated. If so, the matter of mutual dependence between conventional and ultimate truth necessarily relies on principle. The true nature of sentient beings is the personal emptiness of true suchness explained in various teachings. When discussing this nature in relation to different people, how could the approach of distinction be abandoned? Based on this, the present sutra says: "This dharma dwells in the dharma-position; the characteristics of the world are eternally abiding." That the world of sentient beings is naturally eternally abiding refers to the principle possessed by each of countless sentient beings. Next, when speaking of "non-difference," dependent origination is like illusion and transformation. Even within the conditioned, there are no fixed characteristics. How much more so regarding the characterless principle of empty quiescent nature. Even essence, function, cause and effect are not definitively different. How much more so regarding the provisional self in relation to dharmas, or regarding names and characteristics within that. Regarding that provisional nature, if empty principle definitively has original distinctions, how would the contemplation approach of selflessness be accomplished? Therefore, the Huayan and Śāstra treatises take the identity of dharma-selflessness liberation as the meaning of the one vehicle. The Lotus Commentary explains "manifesting Buddha knowledge and vision" as "the dharma bodies of all Buddhas are originally equal." In the Principle Chapter, it says Bodhisattva Samantabhadra pervades self and others. This approach is also similar. However, the multiple layers are still undetermined. The doubts seem quite excessive. There are separate interpretations as in other commentaries.

The Xuanzan states: "Benevolent compassion and wise awakening is called 'bhadra' (good); virtue and benefit being universally complete is named 'samanta' (universal). This is due to internally realizing the one truth and externally accomplishing myriad virtues. Therefore, because virtue and benefit are universally complete and benevolent compassion and wise awakening [are present], it is named Samantabhadra. The Prajñā Principle states: 'All sentient beings are Buddha-nature; Bodhisattva Samantabhadra pervades his own essence.' Due to realizing the principle of universal goodness, the path that can realize this is called Samantabhadra. Therefore the Huayan states: 'Samantabhadra's bodily characteristics depend on suchness, not on Buddha-lands.' Or, internally realizing this universally good principle, externally manifesting the three actions with nothing not good, therefore named Samantabhadra."

The Mirror Water Commentary states: "Regarding 'Prajñā Principle, etc.,' based on these two fundamental sacred teachings, the name Samantabhadra is established in dependence on true suchness. By raising what is realized, what can realize is taken. From the Prajñā Principle up to 'pervading one's own essence' is the標inscription. Regarding the Tathāgata-garbha nature within all sentient beings' bodies, Bodhisattva Samantabhadra pervades his own nature. The self-dharma body true principle that Samantabhadra depends upon is precisely the Tathāgata nature within all sentient beings' bodies. The Tathāgata-garbha nature within all sentient beings' bodies is precisely the self-essence that the bodhisattva universally realizes and depends upon. Since Bodhisattva Samantabhadra's body already pervades the self-essence he depends upon, we should know that there is nowhere Samantabhadra's body does not exist."

Question: Did Bodhisattva Samantabhadra first come to this sutra assembly during this chapter, or how was it? Considering both sides: if he first came during this chapter, then Bodhisattva Samantabhadra's coming to this world was to assist Śākyamuni's teaching activities. Why didn't he come during the three rounds of proper teaching, but only showed his arrival at the end of the circulation section? Moreover, looking at the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra, it mentions "Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva and others, 84,000 people." This sutra is a different translation of both the Jeweled Stupa and Devadatta chapters. Based on this, we know that he had already come and was listed among the assembly. Accordingly, in the Yijue, during the assembly in space, Samantabhadra was present at the assembly.

If following this, then in this chapter's sutra text it says "At that time, Bodhisattva Samantabhadra came from the east," etc. Moreover, the Introductory Chapter does not list his name. Based on this, the Xuanzan's explanation of the co-hearers of this sutra divides them into initial and final assemblies, taking Samantabhadra as part of the later-arriving assembly. The meaning of the Shechi (at the Encouragement to Maintain section) is also the same. How should this be understood?

Explanation: Bodhisattva Samantabhadra's arrival should occur during this chapter. He comes for dharma protection, not with the intention of listening to the sutra. Therefore the sutra says: "I, in the Buddha-land of King of Jeweled Virtuous Authority, heard from afar that the Lotus Sutra was being taught in this sahā world." He heard from afar in his home land during the three rounds of proper teaching. Why would he be listed among the introductory chapter's assembly? Both Shechi and the Water Commentary dislike the interpretation of prior arrival. The Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra represents the translator abandoning the later assembly and placing them in the earlier sutra, like the 500 śrāvakas in the Inconceivable Realm Sutra. Regarding the Yijue, since the assembly in space already reaches the end of the sutra, what contradiction is there?

The sutra states: "At that time, Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, with sovereign spiritual power, majesty, virtue, and renown, came from the east, arrived at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa in the sahā world, prostrated with his head toward Śākyamuni Buddha, circumambulated seven times to the right, and addressed the Buddha saying: 'World-honored One, I, in the Buddha-land of King of Jeweled Virtuous Authority, heard from afar that the Lotus Sutra was being taught in this sahā world.'"

Shechi four states: "Regarding the sutra's 'bodhisattvas coming from other lands,' etc. Question: When did the bodhisattvas of this land arrive? The sutra's beginning and end have no text to clarify this. Answer: One interpretation holds that since the Stupa Chapter commands sutra-maintainers, the bodhisattvas should respond to the command, wishing to maintain and arriving at this region. Another explanation: these are precisely the bodhisattvas from the Immeasurable Meanings Sutra assembly. The sutra compiler raises the excellent ones. Therefore they were not difficult to list at the sutra's beginning. Or these are the assemblies that the two masters Wonderous Sound and Samantabhadra follow. Discussion: the first explanation is abbreviated and incorrect; the latter two are not as good as considering..."

Mirror Water Commentary states: "Question: Did this bodhisattva come to listen to the sutra or to protect the dharma? If he came to listen to the sutra, the sutra teaching was already completed. Answer: This bodhisattva initially came to listen to the sutra. This is just the sutra compiler's arrangement, placing him at the sutra's end. Question: If he came to listen to the sutra, why isn't he mentioned in the name listings? According to this reasoning, having heard from afar in the Buddha-land of King of Jeweled Virtuous Authority, he should not come again. The intention for coming is solely for dharma protection. The commentary explains it's all for dharma protection."

Question: When Bodhisattva Samantabhadra comes to this world, should he receive reproach from his home Buddha? Answer: The sutra text doesn't mention it. Regarding this, Bodhisattva Wonderous Sound's body measures 420,000 yojanas, and fearing he might generate thoughts of inferiority in this world, his home Buddha added reproach. Moreover, Bodhisattva Samantabhadra's body is limitless and his form and appearance are limitless. Why wouldn't there be reproach?

Explanation: The meanings of Wonderous Sound's and Samantabhadra's arrivals are not necessarily the same. Wonderous Sound first manifested lotus seats, but Samantabhadra had no such auspicious signs. Buddha Pure Flower Star King Wisdom inquired about Śākyamuni, but King of Jeweled Virtuous Authority Buddha had no such words. The great sage's activities differ according to time. Why must we demand equality? Or perhaps when Wonderous Sound wanted to come, adding reproach was already completed, so yielding to him, it wasn't demonstrated again.

This is the initial fruit of the Small Vehicle. Based on this, the Vimalakīrti Commentary criticizes the Yogācāra school's teaching of the first ground, saying: "This contradicts the treatise texts. 'Removing dust and departing from defilement' explains small fruits. The current correct interpretation is that the tolerance of non-arising dharmas is attained at the first ground," and so forth. Therefore there is no fault.

One asks: The various chapters from the Jeweled Stupa onward are taught in the pure land. Those of fixed śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha nature do not see the pure land. How could small vehicle fruits be explained in this assembly? Those śrāvakas who received prophecies in the three cycles had not yet turned their minds during the main section, so they did not see the pure land. At the time of the Jeweled Stupa chapter, having already turned their minds, they first saw the pure land. How much more would those of fixed nature dwell in the pure land? In the Vimalakīrti Sūtra, after the pure land created by pressing the toe returned to defilement, small vehicle fruits were attained. The fruits in this chapter are still in the pure land. Shouldn't two-vehicle people be unable to attain small fruits?

Answer: Those of unfixed nature who have not yet turned their minds still do not see the pure land. How much more so regarding those of fixed nature with foolish dharma understanding. Realizing fruits should initially involve foolish dharma understanding. Therefore, after the circulation section, not hearing the One Vehicle, they cannot become non-foolish regarding dharma. However, within one time, pure and defiled lands exist side by side, with different capacities seeing differently. The reward and transformation body aspects should serve as examples.

The Xuanzan states: "The Abhidharma ninth section and others say: The uninterrupted path can remove dust; the liberation path can depart from defilement. Through the fulfillment of these two, one attains pure dharma eye and realizes the initial fruit."

It also says: "This sūtra also states: For those seeking the śrāvaka path, it teaches the appropriate Four Noble Truths dharma. For those seeking the pratyekabuddha path, it teaches the appropriate Twelve-Link Dependent Origination dharma. For those seeking the bodhisattva path,

[Lower Section]

it teaches the appropriate Six Perfections dharma. In this sūtra's later text, the Wonderful Adorning King chapter, where 84,000 people removed dust and departed from defilement, this can also be said to benefit śrāvakas as a secondary benefit."

It also says: "If taking the One Vehicle as the foundation, it only benefits those with bodhisattva nature and does not benefit those with only śrāvaka nature. The three plants moistened by one rain should each separately benefit śrāvakas. The Yogācāra and others say: The uninterrupted path can remove dust; the liberation path can depart from defilement. Realizing this superior wisdom is called pure dharma eye. This is precisely the stream-entry fruit of seeing truth, etc. Therefore we know that even where the One Vehicle is not being taught, śrāvakas are also benefited. Since this already exists in sūtra assemblies, this explanation is made. This sūtra is taught to benefit appropriate capacities."

It also says: "In the Wonderful Adorning King's Past Deeds chapter, 84,000 people removing dust and departing from defilement to attain pure dharma eye refers to the initial fruit, etc."

The Collected Commentary One says: "Question: Examining the Ornament Treatise, this is included in the Great Vehicle's path of seeing position. Its seventh section says: 'Departing from defilement means the afflictions eliminated by the path of seeing are extinguished. The bodhisattva at that time is called one who removes dust, departs from defilement, and attains pure dharma eye.' What the Great Treatise explains in section 86 refers to śrāvakas. It explains that removing dust gains ten benefits. Second: following the attainment of one śramaṇa fruit. Third: understanding that I have realized stream-entry. According to these two treatises, it applies to both great and small vehicles. Why judge this as definitely fixed-nature śrāvakas? Answer: However, the Lotus Sūtra is a third period teaching of universal arousal. Since chapters like Discrimination have arousing great mind, the expression 'removing dust' clearly indicates attaining small fruits. Due to this meaning, arousing all vehicles is necessary, and it also doesn't contradict the teaching of removing dust. The commentary, based on this meaning, judges this as śrāvaka and doesn't say removing dust

doesn't apply to the great existence. Even so, how do we know this refers to fixed nature? Answer: Examining what the Excellent Courage Prajñā explains: 'If regarding those of unfixed nature among the three vehicles, after hearing this dharma they arouse the mind of perfect enlightenment.' Since it doesn't mention arousing the mind of perfect enlightenment, we know it's fixed nature. Removing obstacles can be understood accordingly."

The Meaning Commentary Twelve says: "There are two types of pure dharma eye. First, in the Small Vehicle it's the initial fruit. Second, in the Great Vehicle it's the first ground. This is difficult to understand. However, most sūtras clarify that pure dharma eye belongs to the Small Vehicle. Those who hear the Great Vehicle and awaken to small fruits are people of dull faculties who, though hearing the great dharma, lack skillful means and therefore realize small fruits. But realizing small fruits generally has two types. First, those who are originally Great Vehicle people who, upon hearing Great Vehicle teachings, retreat and realize small fruits, like the sixty bodhisattvas in the Great Prajñā. Second, those who originally studied the Small Vehicle and, hearing Great Vehicle teachings, realize small fruits."

The Sovereign Kings Sūtra Five (according to the Fulfilling Wishes in Dependence on Emptiness chapter) says: "When this chapter was taught, 8 billion celestial beings removed dust, departed from defilement, and attained pure dharma eye."

The commentary on the same sūtra, fourth section, says: "From 'eight thousand' to 'eye pure' in the sūtra. The praise says: They attained the benefit of the path of seeing. Celestials encompass desire and form realms. The Revelation Treatise says those who are extremely moved are not in evil destinies, those who are extremely joyful are not in the upper two - this is explained according to sudden awakening, not obstructing the mind-turning entry into seeing in the form realm. Also explained regarding the two vehicles, not based on the Great Vehicle. Yogācāra 83 explains 'removing dust and departing from defilement' saying... namely following the realization-attainment of śramaṇa fruits. This word 'following attainment' indicates the uncertainty of attainment. First: the sequence of arising is uncertain. Second: it applies to three vehicles. Since some don't attain fruits, the word 'following' is explained... The Great Ornament Treatise seventh text, though slightly different, has the same meaning as Yogācāra."

The same first section says: "Clarifying the benefited capacities, there are roughly two explanations. First: it only benefits Great Vehicle root natures. When the benefits obtained below mention 'removing dust and departing from defilement,' etc., according to the Great Ornament Treatise, attaining entry to the first ground is also called attaining pure dharma eye, since it's not only śrāvakas. Second: Since third period teachings universally benefit the five vehicles, the assembly lists śrāvakas and also has removing dust and departing from defilement. According to the Yogācāra Treatise, attaining stream-entry fruit, though the texts have no definitive explanation, can universally benefit. However, within the main section it's only for bodhisattvas; from the Four Heavenly Kings chapter onward it can universally benefit others, since all are made to attain human and celestial fruits. The second explanation is superior, permitting inclusion in third period dharma wheel teachings."

The Vimalakīrti Commentary Third says: "Twenty thousand celestial beings removed dust and departed from defilement, attained pure dharma eye and realized stream-entry fruit, as fully explained in the treatises... Regarding pure dharma eye, some say it's the first ground. This contradicts treatise texts. 'Removing dust and departing from defilement' explains small fruits. The current correct interpretation is that tolerance of non-arising dharmas is attained at the first ground."

The Ornament Treatise Seventh (composed by Asaṅga, translated by Paramārtha, says): "Having explained the positions of heat and others, next regarding the path of seeing position, the verse says: 'Removing those two grasping, supramundane supreme, non-discriminating departing from defilement, this wisdom at this time attained.' The explanation says: Removing those two grasping means grasper and grasped do not unite. Supramundane supreme means attaining the supreme vehicle. Non-discriminating means precisely those two grasping discriminations are absent. Departing from defilement means afflictions eliminated by the path of seeing are extinguished. The bodhisattva at that time is called one who removes dust, departs from defilement, and attains pure dharma eye. The verse says: This is precisely transformation of basis, through attaining the first ground, afterward passing through immeasurable eons, the pure basis becomes complete. The explanation says: This departing from defilement is precisely the bodhisattva's transformation of basis position. Why? Through attaining the first ground

The sūtra states:
The Xuanzan states: "Because the giving accords with principle, because it is true and correct practice, because it seeks bodhi, it is called Dharma giving."

The Jueze ji states: "Regarding the commentary's '[giving] accords with principle' up to 'Dharma giving' - this is like having the question 'Necklaces are material wealth. How can they be called Dharma giving?' Therefore this answers by saying: Because it accords with principle and is true and correct practice, and seeks bodhi. This is giving according to Dharma, called Dharma giving. It is not teaching Dharma."

Question: Is Bodhisattva Akṣayamati a householder or renunciant? If a householder assembly member, householder bodhisattvas necessarily engage in offering activities. However, in the *Nirvāṇa Sūtra*, Bodhisattva Akṣayamati is not listed among the offering assembly. From this we know he is not a householder bodhisattva. If following this, then since he offered necklaces to Avalokiteśvara, he must be a householder bodhisattva. Renunciant bodhisattvas do not have necklaces and other ornamental implements.

Answer: Master Chōshun has two explanations. First, this is a renunciant bodhisattva. Offering necklaces - though renunciant, he is not bound by minor regulations. Second, he is a householder. Not being included in the offering assembly in the *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* is because he is not an original resident of Sahā, so he does not bring offering implements.

The Jueze ji states: "Zang asks: Akṣayamati is a renunciant bodhisattva. How does he have necklaces? Answer: Though renunciant, he is not bound by minor regulations. Also stated: This is a householder bodhisattva. The *Nirvāṇa* states he 'does not enter the offering assembly list' because this is a householder from another realm who is not originally an old resident of Sahā, so he does not bring offerings."

*Nirvāṇa Sūtra* fascicle 1 states:

Question: What does the sūtra text "offering one portion to the Prabhūtaratna Buddha stupa" reveal? Proceeding to say: Avalokiteśvara received the necklace offered by Akṣayamati, divided it into two portions, and of these, offered one portion to the Prabhūtaratna Buddha stupa - this is the meaning of the text. Regarding this, since the emanation bodies came to the assembly and the jeweled stupa opened its doors, the two buddhas sit together while the assembled multitude gazes up in reverence. Why, regarding the two World-Honored Ones, does [the text] refer to Śākyamuni as "buddha-body" but call Prabhūtaratna "buddha stupa"? If so, other schools maintain the meaning in the Entrustment Sūtra, saying the jeweled stupa closed its doors, specifically following the sūtra text of this chapter. Our school establishes the meaning of the sūtra's end - how does it resolve the doubt about revering the stupa rather than the buddha?

Answer: The jeweled stupa emerged with Prabhūtaratna dwelling within. Some places refer to the dwelling buddha, other places mention the dwelling stupa. Why must this necessarily indicate the stupa's opening and closing? Moreover, according to other schools' understanding, in the chapters from Bhaiṣajyarāja onward, only "stupa" is mentioned without mentioning the buddha, so if this chapter speaks of the "Prabhūtaratna Buddha stupa," why does the Gadgadasvara chapter state "this long-extinct Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata still manifests his form for you all"? From this we know that though calling it by the stupa's name, that buddha is always present.

The Yijue states: "Eighth, the proof 'revering the stupa, not the buddha' is inadmissible. If using Gadgadasvara's reverence for the stupa without mentioning revering the buddha, this would immediately prove the stupa is closed. When Samantabhadra comes, if not mentioning 'revering the stupa,' the stupa should also be absent. One cannot say 'the stupa departed from this time onward.' The text has no place mentioning the stupa's departure. Though not revering the stupa, this does not prevent the stupa's existence. Not mentioning revering the buddha does not prevent seeing the buddha. Also, like after the stupa opened, everything is generally in empty space. Mañjuśrī's oceanic assembly speaks of going to Vulture Peak - how could one not know the buddha is in the jeweled stupa? Because it is the original mountain, it says 'going to the mountain'; because originally in the stupa, it says 'revering the stupa.' This is not failing to point to space or personally bow to the buddha. Also, like saying 'respectfully written below the stupa,' this is not necessarily placed under feet and knees. This is merely respectful language. This should also be so. Also, according to the *Saddharma-puṇḍarīka*, Avalokiteśvara offers necklaces, one portion to Śākyamunibuddha, one portion to Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata. It does not say offering to the stupa. This clarifies the stupa has not yet closed and can be wonderfully seen. Now saying 'only hearing' makes it inadmissible."

Question: Should Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara offer to the emanated buddhas using the necklace offered by Bodhisattva Akṣayamati? The sūtra text does not mention such offering. Regarding this, the emanation bodies are already under the trees. Why doesn't Avalokiteśvara divide the necklace? Therefore, according to other schools' understanding, maintaining the meaning in the Entrustment Sūtra, this is after the emanation bodies returned, so only offering to Śākyamuni and Prabhūtaratna. This doctrine well accords with the sūtra's great meaning. How should our school resolve this?

Answer: The meaning of offerings and such follows temporal appropriateness. Why necessarily criticize this? Moreover, the emanation bodies are countless. How could one use a small portion of necklace to make offerings to so many buddhas? If also using non-offering to prove the emanation bodies departed, the dragon girl used her pearl to offer solely to the Buddha - could the Prabhūtaratna Buddha stupa not be at the assembly?

The Yijue states: "Ninth, the proof of 'unequal division' is inadmissible. If using only Prabhūtaratna to make two portions without offering to transformation buddhas, this would clarify there are no transformation buddhas. Also, the dragon girl only offering to Śākyamuni and Prabhūtaratna should also indicate departure. Also, Mañjuśrī does not bow to Prabhūtaratna, but Prabhūtaratna is not absent. Avalokiteśvara does not offer to emanation bodies - how can one immediately say they departed? Because reverence and respect are not equal, this is inadmissible."

Question: What meaning does Avalokiteśvara express by dividing the necklace offered by Akṣayamati into two portions and offering them to Śākyamuni and Prabhūtaratna? The Sheshaku indicates manifesting the equality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Regarding this, if combining the two distinct portions into one, it should most certainly express the meaning of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa equality. Since one necklace is divided into two portions, how does this reveal the meaning of equality? Moreover, at the time of the Jeweled Stupa chapter, the two buddhas sat together, already revealing the equality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. At the time of this chapter, why repeatedly manifest this meaning?

Answer: Śākyamuni has a living body, provisionally indicating saṃsāra. Prabhūtaratna has already passed away, able to reveal nirvāṇa. Making offerings of necklaces to those two buddhas simultaneously in one thought demonstrates the equality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. This is not using division to mean equality. Though a single equality, what fault is there in demonstrating again? That vehicle equality is manifested in eight chapters - how much more in two instances?

The Sheshaku states: "The sūtra's Avalokiteśvara receiving the pearls, dividing into two portions, and offering to Prabhūtaratna and others - one doctrine states..."

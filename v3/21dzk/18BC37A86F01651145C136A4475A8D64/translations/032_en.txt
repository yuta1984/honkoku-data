"raṇī." Also, words unimpeded understanding is dharma dhāraṇī. Also, words unimpeded understanding is included in dharma dhāraṇī. Eloquence extends to both dharma and meaning and is included.

The Kyōsui Commentary states: Saying "Question: total retention has four, etc." means: first dharma, second meaning, third eloquence unimpeded understanding, fourth words unimpeded understanding. These are the four dharmas that are retained. If discussing what is cited in the commentary, the first two of dharma and meaning are included among the four dharmas retained by dhāraṇī. The later cited two of eloquence and words are not included within dhāraṇī. This differs from the four retained by dhāraṇī. There are two explanations: First: Among the two total retentions, eloquence unimpeded understanding extends to dharma and meaning and is included within dhāraṇī. Words unimpeded understanding is included within dharma dhāraṇī. Second: It is the commentary master's scribal error. Though various masters make the former explanation, both are mistaken.

The Saishō Commentary, volume five, states: Question: Among the four eloquences, what are they? Answer: There are four in total. How do we know? Below it says "perfect adornment words, explaining eloquence and words unimpeded eloquence." In this sūtra, letters, phrases, and meanings - these dharma and meaning - the two eloquences have two aspects of sūtra essence: first explanatory text, second explained meaning. Both are called sūtra. Both are awakening, namely joyful explanation unimpeded eloquence. Therefore, concluding it says "moreover giving dhāraṇī." Total retention unimpeded - dhāraṇī is the four capable retainers, unimpeded is the retained four unimpeded eloquences. Question: What is the difference between four unimpeded understandings and four unimpeded eloquences? Answer: Understanding the four without obstruction is called understanding; explaining the four without impediment is called eloquence. Eloquence arises depending on understanding; understanding is manifested through eloquence. The essence being wisdom, in various sūtras, sometimes following each other, simply combining four retentions and four non-forgettings is called total retention.

That is, including mindfulness and wisdom.

Question: In the Xuanzan it says "this sūtra explains dharma-meaning and incantation total retention." In that case, what text do the two kinds of dharma-meaning total retention correspond to? The Xuanzan says "the above prose is called dharma-meaning retention." Regarding this, both prose and verses have explanatory and explained dharma-meaning. Why only limit to prose and reject verses? Next, what is explained in the two chapters of Adorning King and Encouragement below this chapter - are these not the two kinds of dharma-meaning total retention?

Response: Using dharma and meaning to explain differences in contrast to incantations, therefore saying "above prose" means raising prose to include verses. Because there is no distinction in the scope of dharma and meaning. It does not say prose to exclude verses. Next, the two chapters of Adorning King and Encouragement can also be included in dharma and meaning. However, explaining dharma and meaning above leading to divine incantations includes and encompasses the previous dharma and meaning. Dharmas not yet explained somewhat do not follow sequence, therefore are also abbreviated. The Heart Sūtra Profound Commentary states: "Above prose explains dharma and meaning, two retentions, below explains incantation retention." Same as the present commentary, can be understood accordingly.

The Xuanzan states: (as below next)

The Shōshaku states: The commentary's "above prose called dharma-meaning retention" has two meanings. Because the initial prose of this chapter is above the incantations, it is called "above." Second, it extends to all prose of previous chapters. Moreover, properly asking why exclude verses? Answer: Also not excluding. In contrast to later incantations, collectively called prose.

Think further.

Question: In this chapter, should non-arising patience total retention be explained? The Xuanzan does not explain it. Regarding this, looking at the sūtra text, sixty-eight thousand people heard dhāraṇī and attained non-arising patience. The assembly already has this benefit. Know that it explains non-arising patience total retention. Based on this, Master Bokuyo explains non-arising patience total retention. The teacher-disciple explanations seem to reach contradiction.

Response: This sūtra explains non-arising patience total retention. This chapter together with the three chapters of Lifespan, Wonderful Sound have non-arising patience benefits. If this total retention is not explained, already having no capable retention total retention, how could there be attained dharma patience? Therefore the Shōshaku states: "Additionally taking previously attained patience, all called total retention." However, regarding the Xuanzan, Master Bokuyo explains: "The sūtra does not clarify the dharma function position of attaining non-arising dharma patience. The next differential meaning name is absent. Non-arising patience does not obstruct hearing the sūtra, having beneficial attainment."

Dharma function means: dwelling alone in empty tranquility, without words or explanations, up to in what the Buddha explained, attaining bodhisattva patience, having various incantation verses, capable of careful contemplation, etc. Also separately having divine incantations for attaining bodhisattva patience, as explained in the Yogācārabhūmi. This sūtra lacks such specific explanations, therefore saying absent.

Inquiry: Discussing: saying "additionally taking previously attained patience" is distinct from the previous meaning, further stating separate intent. That is, though called non-arising patience retention, doesn't it say explaining capable attainment incantations?

Answer: The Shōshaku above states its own meaning, next citing "according to one view." The view takes this chapter's divine incantations as the essence of non-arising patience total retention. Discussing: "additionally taking previously attained patience, all called total retention" means not limited to this chapter's incantations, universally using previous chapters' dharma and meaning, all called this total retention. This is the purport of the discussion, not actual personal meaning.

Separately inquiring: The fourth attaining non-arising patience total retention - concretely what thing is it? Does it have no separate essence from the previous three?

Answer: The Yogācāra Commentary states: "Capable of attaining patience dhāraṇī uses non-discriminating wisdom as the essence of patience. That is, realizing suchness. What is capable of attaining patience is preparatory wisdom, capable of having incantation-retaining function, capable of corresponding to suchness." The meaning is: attained patience is undefiled fundamental wisdom. Capable attaining patience is preparatory non-discriminating wisdom. The object realm of that capable attaining patience is incantation verses. Actually it also extends to both dharma and meaning. Incantations contain dharma and meaning. Opening and closing follow appropriateness. Preparatory wisdom is capable of retaining divine incantations, should attain non-discriminating wisdom. That is capable of attaining bodhisattva non-arising patience total retention.

The Xuanzan states: Question: Total retention has four kinds. In order to attain dharma-meaning-eloquence-words unimpeded understanding, accordingly explaining four. What does this explanation refer to? Answer: The above prose is called dharma-meaning retention. This present incantation retention is for protecting the previous two. Therefore clarifying it. There is no attaining non-arising patience total retention.

The Shōshaku states: The commentary's "no attaining non-arising patience retention" means this sūtra does not explain total retention for attaining non-arising patience. Question: In the Distinguishing Merits chapter, due to hearing the Tathāgata's long-distant lifespan, six hundred eight

Therefore, the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra states: "The World-Honored Prabhūtaratna, the seven-jeweled lecture hall, the Buddha's stupa-temple, immediately returned to its former place." Through Dharmakṣa's clear original text, we understand Kumārajīva's hidden text. However, according to our school's interpretation, those who resolve difficulties regarding the sūtra consider this to be editorial embellishment by the translator. This is the same as the text "paid homage and departed." How do we know this? When obtaining the disordered text and placing the Entrustment chapter in the middle of the sūtra, if it were like the Sanskrit original where the transformation bodies and Prabhūtaratna each return to their original lands, then the following chapters would properly have the jeweled stupa, and to avoid doubts and difficulties of later ages, they roughly omitted the weighty difficulties and made some embellishments. Even if it were as seen in practice, why would the sūtra mention the light matters and abbreviate the weighty ones? The so-called closing of the stupa doors is a minor matter, yet Śākyamuni still gives encouragement. Permanently returning to the original land is a major matter - why wouldn't the teaching master announce it? From this we know that the Sanskrit text's wording should still be clear. Moreover, regarding the text as seen in practice, there are still details. When that Buddha came from the eastern direction, he did not come directly but emerged from the great earth and rose high into the void. This demonstrates the equality of saṃsāra and nirvana. Therefore, when returning, he should again enter the great earth as before. Because the great earth of saṃsāra and the void of nirvana are neither identical nor separate. The transformation-body buddhas took seats near and far according to the order of their arrival at the assembly. When returning, they should also follow their convenience. The Saddharmapuṇḍarīka states: "The World-Honored Ones who came from the ten directions each followed their convenience and returned to where they were settled." Prabhūtaratna's return path can be understood by analogy to this. "Should return as before" reveals this meaning. To say "close the stupa but not return" deviates from both text and principle.

The Xuanzan states: "From 'At that time' to 'should return as before.' The praise says: The third major section causes the stupa and others to return. From this point onward, there is no further place of return. Therefore we know this chapter should be at the end of the sūtra."

The same first [volume] states:

Question: According to our school's interpretation, this chapter is at the end of the sūtra. What evidence proves this? The praise states: "From this point onward, there is no further place of return. Therefore we know this chapter should be at the end of the sūtra." Regarding this, after this chapter, although the stupa closes its doors, until the end of the sūtra the jeweled stupa is still present at the place of expounding the sūtra. The stupa returns by itself - why seek its place of return? The "paid homage and departed" of the Encouragement chapter has both general and specific aspects. Although the paying homage doesn't apply to Prabhūtaratna, the departing applies universally to all. How is this not a place of return? Moreover, there is no text about the land returning to defilement, yet its land already returned to defilement, and there are no texts about humans and gods coming or Mañjuśrī entering the ocean, yet all these events are accepted. When it comes to the jeweled stupa's return, why demand textual evidence?

The above is recorded based on Miaowen's counter-arguments.

Another argument states: The transformation bodies were summoned by emitted light, so they are commanded to leave. Prabhūtaratna came by himself for testimony - why announce his return? Another argument: The transformation buddhas are my emanation bodies, so I command them to come and go. Prabhūtaratna is a guest buddha - how could one urge his return? According to the etiquette between host and guest, this principle is not appropriate. The general outline of this matter is as in the previous topic. That school's explanatory interpretation ultimately doesn't stand. But if he returns by himself at the end of the assembly, why also explain the departure of other multitudes? Why does this chapter encourage the transformation bodies but not tell Prabhūtaratna? Next, the matter of implying the word "departure" is also meaningless. Because the above doesn't explain the jeweled stupa matter at all. Between guest buddhas from other directions coming and returning, and this world's assembly withdrawing and returning, which matter is more important? But not explaining the land's characteristics

as a parallel difficulty is a question for both schools. Moreover, guest buddhas from other directions are treated with courtesy like Never-Disparaging; at the two times of coming and going, the host should necessarily console and guide them. The material world is mindless and also self-transformed - why urge returning to the defiled land? Even if the sūtra has no disputes at all, it doesn't reach the level of criticism. However, what the text "should return as before" points to already corresponds to this matter. To mistakenly lose the original meaning is truly fearful. Texts like Mañjuśrī entering the ocean are originally not of this type, so there's no discussion.

The next two arguments also have the same previous faults. They abandon the clear text of return and vainly store up explanatory interpretations. Moreover, if Prabhūtaratna is not summoned, why urge closing the stupa? Also, if the guest buddha differs from oneself, there's no reason for the announcement "should return as before."

Eight Difficulties (Xuanzan Volume 1, Chapter Arrangement)

1. Difficulty of Contradicting Multiple Texts
The praise states: In the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka translated by Dharmakṣa in Jin times, and in the Supplemented Lotus Sūtra translated by the two persons Jñānagupta and Dharmagupta in Sui times, this Entrustment chapter is placed at the end of the sūtra.

2. Difficulty of Treatise and Sūtra Contradiction
The praise states: In the Lotus Treatise ○ it already speaks of "the manifestation of protective dharma power, Samantabhadra, and later chapters." Clearly showing that the entrustment should be placed at the end of the sūtra.

3. Difficulty of Different Teachings
The praise states: Entrustment sections in other sūtras are all at the end of the sūtra. Why is this sūtra uniquely explained in the front?

【Lower Section】
4. Difficulty of Two Matters Being Contradictory
The praise states: If by causing the transformation-body buddhas to return, this land becomes defiled and Wonderful Sound is warned when coming, then in the Entrustment chapter, the Prabhūtaratna stupa is also caused to return. Why does Avalokiteśvara still divide the pearl offering into two parts?

5. Difficulty of Unequal Commands
The praise states: If both transformation bodies and Prabhūtaratna are ordered to return, why do transformation bodies immediately return while the Prabhūtaratna buddha-stupa still remains? If saying "cause the Prabhūtaratna stupa to return as before" merely means closing the stupa, then why does the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka say "should return to the original land"?

6. Difficulty of No Return Place for the Stupa
The praise states: Moreover, regarding the transformation-body buddhas, Śākyamuni commands their departure and initially speaks of return. The Prabhūtaratna buddha-stupa has no further place of return until the end of the sūtra.

7. Difficulty of Pure and Defiled Being Different
The praise states: Moreover, by Wonderful Sound receiving admonishment, it's not a pure land. Therefore we know the transformation bodies have long since returned to their countries - on the day the transformation buddhas assembled, why did each command attendants to hold lotus flowers in their hands and all proceed to Vulture Peak? ○ Also, when Mañjuśrī's ocean assembly was about to arrive here, they were already at Vulture Peak when flowers suddenly appeared.

8. Difficulty of Assembly's Joy Contradicting Emotions
The praise states: Moreover, the Entrustment chapter causes the transformation buddhas to return, but the stupa doesn't depart at that time. If it's not that the entrustment occurs only at the end of the sūtra, why do asuras and others all have great joy so prematurely? ○

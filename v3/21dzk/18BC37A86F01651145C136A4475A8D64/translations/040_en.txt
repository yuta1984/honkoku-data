Seeing in seven days, etc. Having already surpassed the category of twenty-one days to become supreme diligence, one quickly sees the bodhisattva. Know that what the categories of twenty-one days and so forth would see slowly as the superior body, this person sees quickly. The Xuanzan has both granting and taking away aspects regarding this meaning. Although it allows the category of seeing in seven days, it takes this away as an inferior body. Therefore it says "initially seeing the inferior body is possible in seven days." Regarding seeing Avalokiteśvara, whether this serves as an example or not, neither constitutes a serious difficulty.

Further inquiry: The already-accomplished lecturer Shucho says that the five grades are respectively the five stages of provisions, etc. Following his intention, what is seen in the five stages should progressively improve. Why are there practitioners of five grades who see the same grade of body? Answer: Although Great Virtue Mado's assignment to the five stages seems ingenious, it is probably still difficult to believe. Even what is seen at the Buddha stage is still called Bodhisattva Samantabhadra. Calling the Tathāgata of the fruit stage a "practitioner" does not resemble ordinary teachings. Moreover, examining the Samantabhadra Sūtra, after explaining the category of those who see the bodhisattva in twenty-one days, it states that those with heavy obstacles see in forty-nine days, and those with further heavy obstacles see in one lifetime, etc. The meaning is that what some people see in twenty-one days, other people cannot see due to heavy obstacles until forty-nine days, etc.

The Xuanzan states: "Regarding those who practice with single-minded diligence for twenty-one days, the Samantabhadra Contemplation Sūtra clarifies five methods of practice. First: immediate seeing in twenty-one days. Second: seeing in forty-nine days. Third: seeing in one lifetime. Fourth: seeing in two lifetimes. Fifth: seeing in three lifetimes. Among these, according to ancient explanations, superior diligence sees in one (or three) periods of seven days, up to the fifth grade requiring three lifetimes of cultivation to finally see. Also, this is not fixed - initially seeing the inferior body

is possible in one (or three) periods of seven days, up to seeing the superior body in three lifetimes. Cultivating different lengths of time to finally see the superior."

The Water Commentary states: "Ancient explanations refer to Jiaxiang's division of five grades within Samantabhadra practice methods, which differs slightly from the sutra text... Saying 'also this is not fixed' is the commentary master's position."

The Supreme Victory Commentary, volume 4, states: "(In the section on the Golden Victory Dhāraṇī) There are three ways to fulfill wishes. First, those with much merit have their wishes fulfilled in fourteen days. Second, if not fulfilled due to heavy negative karma, they make further commitments and act as before. This divides into two grades. Following other practices, mostly there are three grades. Either obtaining sharp or dull faculties, or having three grades of obstacles, or three grades of cultivation like seeking Samantabhadra - either seven, fourteen, or twenty-one days, or further lifetimes due to differences in karmic weight and lightness. This is also thus."

Question: The Xuanzan explains Samantabhadra practitioners seeing Samantabhadra, presenting differences from seven days to three lifetimes. How should the superiority or inferiority of the bodies seen be explained? The Xuanzan states seeing inferior bodies in seven days and superior bodies in three lifetimes. Regarding this, based on practitioners' faculties, there should be differences in speed and the great being's manifestation of bodies should have superiority and inferiority. Those with light karmic defilement see bodies quickly and should most appropriately manifest superior bodies. Those with heavy obstacles extend to three lifetimes, and the bodies they see should definitely be inferior bodies. The Xuanzan's various explanations are difficult to understand. How so?

Explanation: Those who see the superior body in twenty-one days first see the inferior body in seven days, etc. Those who see the superior body in three lifetimes can see the inferior body in two lifetimes, etc. The five grades being explained all see the superior body. The commentary master, by refuting certain people, clarified the meaning of seeing inferior bodies in preliminary expedient means. If following the intention of earlier masters, what is seen in the five stages progresses from inferior at first to superior later, because the five stages of provisions, etc. constitute the five grades.

The Xuanzan states: (As above)

Question: In the Xuanzan, those who cultivate repentance should request the six masters and receive the three collections of precepts, etc. Should there be texts for requesting the six masters in exoteric teachings? The Xuanzan says "the texts of the six masters have not been seen." Regarding this, according to the great master's explanation of the Samantabhadra Contemplation Sūtra, it demonstrates the method for repenting karmic obstacles and explains the principle of requesting various masters. Namely, making Śākyamuni Buddha the precept master, up to making Bodhisattva Samantabhadra the repentance master. Since there are clear explanations, why say "those texts have not been seen"? Based on this, the upper text of the Xuanzan explains Samantabhadra practice methods according to that sutra's explanation, stating "fourth, requesting the six masters."

Explanation: Examining the Xuanzan's intention, although there are no other teaching texts, Samantabhadra practitioners should receive bodhisattva precepts and request the six masters. It does not say the texts are not seen in the Samantabhadra Sūtra. Generally, bodhisattva precepts request five masters. The Tang Tripitaka received bodhisattva major prohibitions at Śīlabhadra's place as the ritual method.

If the Samantabhadra Sūtra clearly requested six masters, it would not require this explanatory interpretation. That sutra only says "May Śākyamuni, the perfectly enlightened World-Honored One, be my precept master... May the great virtue bodhisattvas be my companions" - this is the section properly requesting masters. There are only five masters: master, ācārya, instructor, witness, and companions.

Next, after completing the three refuges and six major precepts, Bodhisattva Samantabhadra assists in arousing practice. Not being listed among the five masters, there are also no requesting words. The great master grasped the intent and demonstrated the rules, but not as authentic text. Therefore it says "now provisionally explaining." Thus, even if including the Samantabhadra Sūtra among texts where the six masters' texts are not seen, this does not strongly contradict. How much more so since the Xuanzan originally refers to other teachings.

Although the Heart-Ground Contemplation Sūtra requests six assemblies, Brahmā, Śakra, the Four Kings, and Vajra devas are external protectors, not masters. Also not Samantabhadra. Moreover, that sutra was translated after the great master's passing - it is a separate matter.

The Xuanzan states: "Regarding the diligent, it explains six dharmas. First: adorning the practice place. Second: washing the body clean. Third: prostrating at six periods. Fourth: requesting the six masters. Fifth: reciting Mahāyāna sutras day and night. Sixth: contemplating the principles of profound emptiness dharmas. When making this contemplation, one immediately sees Samantabhadra and can eliminate millions of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya lifetimes of heavy sins. The texts of the six masters have not been seen. Now explaining completely: Śākyamuni Buddha as master, Mañjuśrī as ācārya, Maitreya Bodhisattva as instructor, the Buddhas of the ten directions as witnesses, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas of the ten directions as dharma companions, and Samantabhadra as repentance precept master, then one may...

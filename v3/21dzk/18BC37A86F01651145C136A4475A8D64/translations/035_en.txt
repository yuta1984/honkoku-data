The text below states: "At that time, in the empty sky, seven-jewel canopies rained down, covering Medicine King above. From the light of the canopies, verses were spoken: 'Great being's wonderful good vow, giving medicine responding to all. In the future shall attain buddhahood, with the name Pure Eyes.'" At that time, the great assembly, having heard these words, each removed their necklaces and scattered them together on Medicine Superior Bodhisattva. "In the future shall attain buddhahood, with the name Pure Treasury."

Question: Where does the Buddha Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom explain this sūtra? The sūtra states: "Now present under the seven-jewel bodhi tree." Regarding this, the standard practices of all buddhas of the three periods explaining this sūtra are largely the same. Moreover, Vulture Peak and Rājagṛha are especially excellent mountains and cities where the One Vehicle must be taught. Why does Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha alone teach this sūtra under the bodhi tree? Next, is "under the bodhi tree" the place of initial perfect enlightenment? If so, why not teach the expedient Three Vehicles but quickly teach the One Vehicle true teaching?

Answer: Following the present text, the Lotus Sūtra is taught under the bodhi tree. The teaching methods of all buddhas are sovereign and inconceivable. The places where the Lotus is taught are not necessarily uniform. That Vulture Peak Mountain and Rājagṛha surpass other mountains and cities is discussed in relation to the present buddha world. The birthplaces of the past seven buddhas differ slightly. Others can also be understood similarly. Moreover, Thunder Sound King Buddha is not identified as a buddha of any particular realm. If from another realm, how could there definitely be places like Spirit Mountain? Or the seven-jewel bodhi tree represents pure land characteristics, thus differing from defiled land customs. Or being "under the bodhi tree" refers to the initial matter of attaining enlightenment.

"Extensively teaching the Lotus Sūtra among all worldly beings, gods, and humans" refers to later events. Omitting the intermediate period without full explanation, it appears the Lotus is taught at the bodhi tree, but in reality, these are separate times and places. The events during Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha's lifetime can serve as an example of this.

The sūtra states: The two sons addressed the great king: "That Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha is now present on the dharma seat under the seven-jewel bodhi tree, sitting among all worldly beings, gods, and humans, extensively teaching the Lotus Sūtra."

The Heart Ground Contemplation Sūtra states: "Thus these ten buddhas attained supreme enlightenment, each sitting under seven-jewel bodhi trees. After the former buddha's nirvana, the latter buddha attains enlightenment - unlike transformation buddhas manifesting through eons."

Question: Is Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha a reward-body buddha for others, or what? If a reward-body buddha for others, since that land already has Pure Virtue Lady, palace women, and others, isn't it a transformation land? Moreover, being deeply attached to non-Buddhist brahmanical dharmas - how could the reward buddha's pure land have non-Buddhist evil teachers? If not so, it says "now present under the seven-jewel bodhi tree." Since it mentions the seven-jewel bodhi tree, we know it's a reward-body land for others. Therefore, a sūtra (Heart Ground Contemplation Sūtra) explains the reward-body for others sitting under a seven-jewel bodhi tree. Since here and there are the same, it should definitely be a reward-body for others. How so?

Answer: The Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha body explained in this sūtra should be a transformation body, as in one side of the difficulty. However, why must the seven-jewel bodhi tree be limited to the reward land? Transformation body pure lands also use seven jewels for

adornment. The bodhi tree king arrayed with seven jewels should especially be of seven jewels, shouldn't it? Or it can be said that this buddha's characteristics encompass both reward and transformation bodies. Regarding Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathāgata, according to the Xuanzan commentary, though a reward body, fallen great vehicle śrāvakas are present at that assembly, not obstructing the transformation body aspect. Might this buddha also be so?

Question: Should this chapter manifest vehicle equality? Answer: No. Regarding this, the Prophecy chapter mentally manifests vehicle equality. This chapter already explains Wonderful Adorning King's prophecy, clarifying eons, country names, titles, etc. Doesn't this manifest vehicle equality? If it's because it's not Śākyamuni's prophecy, then the Never Disparaging chapter explains past prophecies - how could this constitute vehicle equality?

Answer: Vehicle equality means the equality of Small and Great Vehicles. Because prophecies are given to śrāvakas, it manifests the meaning that both vehicles are equal and non-dual. Wonderful Adorning King barely approached the Buddha's presence and immediately heard the Lotus Sūtra and aroused bodhicitta. This should be sudden awakening, so even with prophecy, why call it vehicle equality? Therefore, the eight-chapter manifestation doesn't include this chapter.

Question: The sūtra text states "removing dust and departing from suffering, attaining pure dharma eye among all dharmas." Is this pure dharma eye a Great Vehicle benefit? The Xuanzan states it's Small Vehicle first fruit benefit. Regarding this, this sūtra breaks the two, unites the two, and returns to entering the One Vehicle. Why, while in the Two Vehicle assembly, would one further obtain Small Vehicle first

[Lower Section]

fruit benefits? Among these, pure dharma eye virtue is not necessarily limited to the Small Vehicle. The Ornament Treatise calls the bodhisattva's path of seeing "pure dharma eye." Some sūtras have aspirants to the Great Vehicle attain pure dharma eye. If this benefit extends to the Great Vehicle, why shouldn't what this chapter clarifies be so?

Answer: This sūtra's "removing dust and departing from suffering, attaining pure dharma eye" is Small Vehicle first fruit benefit. How do we know? The Yogācāra Treatise clarifies ten superior benefits of removing dust and departing from suffering. Second: "Following the attainment of one type of śramaṇa fruit, it's therefore called attaining dharma." Third: "Regarding what oneself has realized, one can self-understand... I have realized stream-entry," etc. Since it mentions śramaṇa fruit and stream-entry, we know it's śrāvaka first fruit. Based on this, Great Master Cí Zhōu, commenting on the Sovereign Kings Sūtra's benefit of removing dust and departing from suffering, sometimes following the Ornament Treatise calls it first ground, sometimes following the Yogācāra Treatise calls it stream-entry fruit, judging the second interpretation as superior and maintaining the meaning of stream-entry fruit. The Lotus and Sovereign Kings are both third period teachings universally for all vehicles, thus peripherally enabling Small Vehicle benefits. The Collected Commentary states: "However, the Lotus Sūtra is a third period teaching of universal arousal. Since chapters like the Discrimination have arousing great mind, the words 'removing dust' clearly indicate attaining small fruits." If so, regarding the difficulty that clarifying the One Vehicle shouldn't have small fruits - first establish what is to be united. Next, the Ornament Treatise establishes the name "pure dharma eye" for the first ground, which isn't disputed, so the Collected Commentary raises that treatise as difficulty, resolving it by not saying "removing dust" doesn't extend to the great existence. Even if removing dust and departing from suffering has meaning extending to the Great Vehicle, this sūtra calls first ground benefit "tolerance of non-arising dharma" or explains it as anuttara-bodhi. Since the names already differ, saying "removing dust and departing from defilement, attaining pure dharma eye," we know this is small

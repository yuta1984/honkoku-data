Question: The sūtra text explains the merit of calling on Avalokiteśvara's name, comparing it to 620 million Ganges sand bodhisattvas. How then does the Master interpret the passage in the Lotus Commentary that mentions upholding the names of 620 million Ganges sand buddhas? Answer: The Xuanzan provides two interpretations. One states "the sūtra is correct and the commentary is mistaken." The other states "following the commentary is also without error." Question: First, regarding the initial interpretation, looking at other sūtra explanations (Eleven-Faced Sūtra), the merit of invoking Avalokiteśvara is compared to hundreds of thousands of koṭis of buddhas. Based on this, the commentary's explanation is not mistaken. Moreover, a certain Mahāyāna treatise (Entering the Mahāyāna Treatise) quotes the present sūtra text, identical to Vasubandhu's Upadeśa, equaling the merit of 620 million buddhas. Among these, our school criticizes Jñānagupta's translation and refutes errors in the Entrustment Sūtra, all taking commentaries as the standard measure. If one admits to having errors, it would be difficult to escape ridicule from other masters. Regarding the second interpretation, the two positions of cause and effect have merits like clouds and mud. Who would raise some amount of fruit merit and equate it to one bodhisattva's merit? Therefore, the *Saddharma-puṇḍarīka* and the *Supplemented Lotus* also compare with bodhisattvas like the Wonderful Sūtra. Which of the two interpretations is correct?

Answer: In the current sūtra it compares with bodhisattvas; in the sūtra cited by the commentary it compares with buddhas. One sūtra text cannot be contradictory. In wanting to take one and abandon the other, using bodhisattvas to compare with buddhas has doubtful reasoning. It is better to compare cause position with cause position, hence saying "the sūtra is correct and the commentary is mistaken." Regarding the sequence of entrustment, there are differences between multiple texts and single texts. According to our school's position, when abandoning a single text in favor of multiple texts, we measure and use the commentary, Samantabhadra, and later chapter texts to assist in criticizing the texts in the sūtra. We are merely comparing commentary and sūtra, not taking the sūtra and abandoning the commentary. Four texts differing from three is also difficult and follows this principle. The meaning of the second interpretation is that Avalokiteśvara has long since become a buddha. Even if comparing with buddhas, there should be no fault. This interpretation's meaning suddenly does not reach selection, and the principle is difficult to know. The meaning of the two interpretations is thus. However, regarding the first interpretation, we do not dislike everything. Therefore, other sūtras cannot be used as difficulties. Discussing the latter interpretation, through faith-power and ultimate knowledge, resolving doubts and difficulties oneself has many difficulties, but none require repeated doubt.

The Xuanzan states: "The original commentary compares with 62 Ganges sand buddhas, while this sūtra speaks of 62 Ganges sand bodhisattvas. There are two explanations for this. First: 'The sūtra is correct and the commentary is mistaken.' Bodhisattvas should be compared with bodhisattvas - how can buddhas be used to compare with bodhisattvas? Just as in the Ten-Wheel Sūtra, only Kṣitigarbha is compared with Maitreya, Mañjuśrī, and Avalokiteśvara, and not compared with buddhas. If not so, buddha merit should be less than bodhisattvas'. Second: 'Following the commentary is also without error.' Avalokiteśvara long ago became a buddha and does not abandon bodhisattva practices, therefore manifests as a bodhisattva. How could there be no comparison with the Tathāgata? Just as Avalokiteśvara's buddha merit and buddha-land surpass Amitāyus, how could all buddha-bodies have superiority and inferiority? Therefore know this is merely language encouraging faith. It is difficult for the sūtra to compare with bodhisattvas; the commentary's explanation that even comparing with buddhas has no fault means both are without error."

The commentary states: "Another explanation is given. Upholding the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and upholding the names of 620 million Ganges sand buddhas have equal merit for two reasons: first, faith-power; second, ultimate knowledge. Faith-power has two kinds: first, seeking that my body be like Avalokiteśvara, autonomous without difference, through ultimate faith-power; second, generating respectful mind toward that [bodhisattva], ultimately attaining like that

merit, I too am thus. Ultimate knowledge means being able to definitely know the dharma-realm. Speaking of dharma-realm means called dharma-nature. That dharma-nature is called the equal dharma-body of all buddhas and bodhisattvas. The equal dharma-body refers to the true-suchness dharma-body. First-ground bodhisattvas are able to realize and enter this. Upholding the names of 620 million Ganges sand buddhas and upholding Avalokiteśvara's name have no difference in attained merit."

The Xuanzan's following passage states: "The commentary's explanation has two interpretations in the accomplishment section: first, faith-power; second, ultimate knowledge. Faith-power has two aspects: first, seeking my body like Avalokiteśvara through ultimate faith. That is, seeking my 620 million Ganges sand buddha-bodies has no difference from faith in Avalokiteśvara. Though the sought sacred teachings differ in quantity, there is no difference in merit because the causal minds are equal. Second is generating respectful mind - like that merit, I too ultimately attain. That is, like that Avalokiteśvara's wisdom and merit from long ago becoming buddha, my 620 million Ganges sand buddhas also ultimately attain these buddhas' merits, believing buddha and bodhisattva merits are not different. These two constitute faith-power. Initially not observing the境's quantity or superiority/inferiority, but making [minds] equal through faith alone. Later, though observing the境's quantities differ, there is no difference in merit, and respectful faithful mind also has no duality. Hence blessings are not different. Second, ultimate knowledge means definitely knowing the dharma-realm. This is because Avalokiteśvara has already attained ultimate knowledge of the dharma-realm, hence no different from buddhas. Being able to realize the dharma-realm equally without duality creates equal blessings. Dharma-realm is dharma-nature; first-ground bodhisattvas can realize all buddhas' and bodhisattvas' equal bodies. Equal body refers to true-suchness dharma-body, how much more at the completion of ten grounds. Therefore, up-

holding Avalokiteśvara's name has no difference from 620 million Ganges sand buddhas' merit. Otherwise, how could bodhisattvas surpass buddhas? For now, using this much to praise and encourage mind-arousal. The first fascicle of the Ten-Wheel states: 'Even if for bodhisattvas headed by Maitreya, Gadgadasvara, Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Samantabhadra and their like, numbering like Ganges sands, one wholeheartedly takes refuge, calls names, recites, bows, and makes offerings for a hundred kalpas seeking various wishes, it does not compare to someone who for a moment's time wholeheartedly takes refuge in, calls the name of, recites, bows to, and makes offerings to Bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha, seeking various wishes and quickly attaining fulfillment.' Also like this, final-age sentient beings have suitable conditions for what they should hear, hence the partial praise. Otherwise, bodhisattvas should also surpass buddha-level positions, and bodhisattvas should have superiority and inferiority."

The *Xing Commentary* fascicle 8 states: "Question: The sūtra speaks of 620 million Ganges sand bodhisattvas - how does the commentary speak of 620 million Ganges sand buddhas? Answer: Some say the sūtra is correct and the commentary is wrong, because buddhas should not be used to compare with bodhisattvas. Some say the commentary is also without error. Avalokiteśvara long ago became buddha and studies bodhisattva practices, so comparing with buddhas - what fault is there? If not so, Avalokiteśvara's buddha merit and buddha-land surpass Amitāyus Buddha, meaning buddhas have superiority and inferiority. Sūtra and commentary each follow one approach and have no contradictions. Though there are two explanations, the superior is the former. Though Avalokiteśvara has already become buddha, the sūtra calls [him] bodhisattva. Regarding 620 million Ganges sand buddhas and bodhisattvas, how does the commentary explain and distinguish calling them bodhisattvas yet speaking of buddhas? As the Ten-Wheel Sūtra states: 'Even if regarding Maitreya, Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Samantabhadra and their like as leaders, great bodhisattvas numbering like Ganges sands, for

Question: The sūtra text states "emitted the light of the great person's characteristic flesh-mound." In that case, how does the Great Master (Tiantai Zhiyi) explain this? He explains: "Emitting the light of the flesh-mound manifests the summoning of great persons." Regarding this, looking at the sūtra text, it emits white-tuft light to summon Wonderful Sound. Moreover, when emitting white-tuft light to gather the divided-body buddhas and summoning Wonderful Sound, why use the flesh-mound light? Therefore a master teacher (Jiaxiang) explains: "Because the wonderful principle of the One Vehicle surpasses the summit of emptiness and existence, therefore the flesh-mound light is emitted." This explanation is appropriate. It should be reconciled according to the above intention. Among them, the flesh-mound characteristic is supreme among great person's characteristics, therefore using that light to summon great persons from other realms. The between-eyebrows characteristic expresses the Middle Way of the One Vehicle, therefore the virtue of the Dharma can be known. Though Jiaxiang's explanation has no particular doubts, it probably still falls short. Or alternatively, both characteristics summoning Wonderful Sound together presents no fault.

The sūtra states: "Śākyamuni Buddha's white-tuft light universally illuminated that land. At that time in the Pure Light Adorned Land there was one bodhisattva named Wonderful Sound... Śākyamuni Buddha's light illuminated his body."

The Xuanzan states: "From the sūtra's 'At that time Śākya-' to 'white-tuft characteristic light.' Commentary: The chapter's text divides into four: first, divine light goes forth summoning; second, Wonderful Sound arrives; third, recording events and returning to his land; fourth, the assembly attains the Way. The first section has two parts: first emitting light, then where it reaches. This is the first. Emitting the flesh-mound light manifests summoning great persons. Emitting the between-eyebrows light expresses commanding for the sake of this sūtra."

The Personal Commentary states: "Question: The sūtra text already says 'white-tuft light universally illuminated that land,' and the following text only says 'Śākyamuni Buddha's light illuminated his body,' not mentioning flesh-mound. How can one say the white-tuft illuminates the land while

the flesh-mound illuminates the body? (First difficulty) Also, when summoning divided-body buddhas, only white-tuft light is emitted, not flesh-mound light. Are the divided-body buddhas not great persons? (Second difficulty) Answer: When Buddha emits two lights, it is not without meaning. Therefore the following sūtra text, though not mentioning flesh-mound, can obtain the essential meaning. Cien's explanation states: 'The flesh-mound light manifests summoning great persons.' The Water Commentary also states: 'The flesh-mound light illuminates the bodhisattva's body. How is this not a sacred body?' (Addressing the first difficulty) Moreover, the divided bodies are in the fruit stage; seeing one tuft of light, one should understand. Because of two purposes, one light is emitted. Bodhisattvas are in the causal stage; if not two lights, they would not know I am being summoned, nor would they know they are summoned for the One Vehicle. Therefore two lights are emitted." (Addressing the latter difficulty)

The Doctrinal Commentary states: "The reason for emitting two lights: because the wonderful principle of the One Vehicle surpasses the summit of emptiness and existence, therefore the flesh-mound light is emitted. Having ultimate knowledge without partiality, being able to discern the illumination of the Middle Way, therefore also emitting the between-eyebrows light. Also, the crown light expresses that the One Vehicle is supreme, what all sages revere. The between-eyebrows clarifies that the One Vehicle is impartial, the Middle Way perfectly upright. Wanting to entrust this Dharma to that person, therefore these two lights are emitted to summon him. Also, the previous chapter states 'The Lotus is foremost; those who uphold the sūtra are also foremost.' Now expressing that person's lofty conduct, therefore Buddha emits crown light. Expressing that person's understanding accords with correctness, therefore emitting between-eyebrows light."

Question: In this chapter, sixteen types of samādhi including Wonderful Banner Characteristic are listed. In that case, what

【Left Page】

level bodhisattvas attain these samādhis? The Xuanzan says they are attained by tenth-ground bodhisattvas. Regarding this, the objectless samādhi is the cessation of perception and feeling. Body-witnesses of non-returners and gradual-awakening bodhisattvas attain it before the grounds. The samādhi of gathering all merit and adornment is the concentration of the king of gathering merit. All grounds cultivate it. If so, saying all sixteen types of samādhi are attained at the tenth ground is inappropriate.

Resolving: Wonderful Sound is a tenth-ground bodhisattva. The samādhis he has attained should definitely surpass the previous nine grounds. However, regarding the two difficult-to-explain samādhis, originally one should not obstruct initial attainment at lower levels. Next, the difficulty of saying they can be attained at previous grounds probably misses the point. In the completion of merit there are beginning, middle, and end. Even if initial attainment exists at pre-ground stages, attaining mastery and reaching perfection occurs in later grounds. The Buddhabhūmi-śāstra, regarding the forbearance of non-arising, exemplifies the two stages of first ground and eighth ground. Therefore, in the Xuanzan's subsidiary explanations, many places use the present sūtra text with numerous such examples. This should be investigated.

The sūtra states:

The Xuanzan states: "From the sūtra's 'attained Wonderful Banner Characteristic' to 'various great samādhis.' Commentary: The fourth section on concentrations being complete has two parts: first listing sixteen concentrations, then concluding with countless ones. First, Wonderful Banner Characteristic: like a banner prominently displayed, the multitudes attain adornment. Second, Lotus: penetrating the principle of the One Vehicle. Third, Pure Virtue: severing defilements and attaining superior virtue. Fourth, Constellation King Sport: constellation means stellar images, king means autonomy, sport means joyful play. Attaining autonomy, able to manifest various images like constellations, constantly entering into sport to benefit sentient beings. Fifth, Imageless: refers to cessation concentration. Objectless concentration is apart from clinging. Sixth, Wisdom Seal:

taking true suchness empty principle as wisdom seal. Or using wisdom as seal, determining right and wrong, true and false. Seventh, Understanding Sentient Beings' Languages: the concentration of unimpeded expression in speech. Eighth, Gathering All Merit: refers to the concentration of the king of gathering merit. Ninth, Pure Existence: able to produce seven purities, nine purities, four purities, etc. The four purities are: purity of basis, purity of object, purity of mind, purity of wisdom. Tenth, Divine Power Sport: able to arouse great supernatural powers. Eleventh, Wisdom Torch: illuminating the various realms of conventional and ultimate truth. Twelfth, Adornment King: able to perfect inner and outer adornments. Thirteenth, Pure Radiance: emitting divine light. Fourteenth, Pure Treasury: containing various virtues. Fifteenth, Exclusive Samādhi: not shared with the two vehicles' attainments. Sixteenth, Sun Rotation: like the sun's brightness, cyclically illuminating the four births. These are all what tenth-ground bodhisattvas traverse. Most are of the fourth dhyāna because of their excellence."

The Lamp Seven states:

Question: The sūtra text states "You should not look down upon that land and generate thoughts of inferiority." What does this explain? Answer: When Wonderful Sound from the Eastern land comes to this realm, Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha admonishes that bodhisattva not to generate thoughts of inferiority regarding the sahā world - this is the text's meaning. Regarding this, Wonderful Sound is a deep-level great being who has long been free from the arrogance of measurement. Even without receiving the Tathāgata's admonishment, why would he generate thoughts of inferiority? Probably after the jeweled stupa emerged and divided bodies came to assemble, hiding earth, stones, and mountains and transforming into pure land, what would Wonderful Sound generate inferior thoughts toward?

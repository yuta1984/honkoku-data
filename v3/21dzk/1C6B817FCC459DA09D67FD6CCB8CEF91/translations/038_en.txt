**Biography of Vinaya Master Fazheng of Yunfeng Temple on Mount Nanyue**
The Vinaya Master's name was Fazheng. He was born into the Guo clan. It is not clear what country he was from. His character and bearing were magnanimous and great, his conduct lofty and steadfast. He opened the Dharma at Yunfeng Temple on Mount Nanyue. The sound of his teaching and transformation was heard far and wide in all four directions. Students looked up to his influence and came in continuous streams like cicadas. The Master gave instruction according to their capacities, benefiting many. Beyond preaching the Dharma, he devoted his efforts to management, leveling foundations and gathering materials for construction, making the pagodas and temples completely new. Each year he assembled disciples to recite the various sutras. On a certain day in the certain month of the seventeenth year of Zhenyuan, after giving final instructions to his disciples, he departed peacefully. He had fifty-seven years of monastic age and lived seventy-eight years in the world. The Master resided at the temple for approximately fifty years total. He constantly practiced austerities and never rested or slacked even in old age. His nature was fierce yet gentle, his spirit clear yet peaceful. Therefore from high ministers and venerable elders down to village children and market boys, none failed to bow their hearts in reverent devotion. The disciples he ordained numbered fifty thousand. Those who mastered his teachings - called Quan, called Yuan, called Zhen, called Xun, called Su and others - totaled over three thousand people. Liu Zihou of Hedong composed a pagoda inscription for the Master.

Schools.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Bianchang**
A Vinaya Master of Hangzhou named Bianchang. The details of his clan and native place are unclear. He transmitted the Dharma from Master Zhou. When his precepts were complete, he specialized in studying the vinaya sections and mastered the principles of cessation, action, opening and restraint. He compiled records in seven volumes explaining the *Shichao*. The Master was also one of the Sixty Schools.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Hengdu Hao of Baoshan in Wu Commandery**
The Vinaya Master's taboo name was Shenhao, courtesy name Hengdu. His secular connections were with the Xu family; he was a native of Wu. His natural disposition was upright and pure, his bearing clear and transcendent. In youth he possessed the demeanor of one who would transcend the mundane. He left home and received instruction in the sutras from Master Yi of Longtai Temple in Qiantang. In the sixth year of Tianbao, an edict was issued to carefully select those of cultivated purity, permitting each prefecture to ordain three people. The Master obtained registration at Fuyuan Temple on Baoshan. At thirty-two years old, he received full ordination from Great Master Xing. Soon hearing that the reputation of Vinaya Master Tanyi of Kuaiji was foremost in the realm, he resolved to depend on him. He studied the *Shichao* and thoroughly penetrated its essential meaning. Before long he returned to reclusion on Baoshan. With one bowl and three robes, he pursued clouds and moon. He never allowed worldly affairs to even slightly trouble his thoughts. In the first year of Qianyuan, Emperor Suzong issued an edict to twenty-seven temples throughout the realm, each selecting seven great virtuous ones to give extended lectures on precepts and vinaya. Honoring the Master's Way, they would not allow him to remain in comfortable retirement, forcibly having him reside at Kaiyuan Temple. The Master could not decline and responded. From this time his reputation for the Way grew daily. Not only did the monastic community admire him, but contemporary nobles - like Runzhou Regional Inspector Lu Xiang, former Palace Attendant Yan Mi, Vice Minister of Rites Liu Taizhen, former Court of Judicial Review Evaluator Zhang Xiang, former Regional Inspector and Vice Prime Minister Li Qiyun and others - humbled their positions to

show respect, partaking of his influence and drinking his virtue. In his later years he bound together monastics and laypeople to form a Western [Pure Land] Society. If there were those unable to abandon worldly burdens, he would have them withdraw. At the time people said, "In a sandalwood forest, ordinary talents naturally wither away." In the winter of the sixth year of Zhenyuan, in the tenth month, he showed slight illness. By the twelfth month the illness became critical. He instructed disciple Weiliang saying: "You must return me to Dongting and establish a pagoda." Another day he said to his attendants: "The sacred forms of the Pure Land have already appeared. I will surely depart this evening." Then he prepared a bath, changed clothes, gathered the assembly, finished preaching the Dharma, and passed away sitting upright. His reported age was seventy-five. His precept age was forty-three. That night the sky had no clouds or shadows, yet stars fell like rain. Strange fragrances filled the room, lasting long without dissipating. At his interment, Jiaoran of Yunxi composed a stele eulogy. The Master recited the *Lotus Sutra* nine thousand times, lectured on the *Four-Part Vinaya Commentary* seven times, and ascended ordination platforms five times. He ordained a certain number of disciples. Those who transmitted his Dharma were seven people: Weiliang, Daochao, Lingjun, Daojun, Daoling, Weirang, and Weicheng. Together they raised the Master's red banner, becoming excellent guides for the region.

The eulogy says: "Master Hao bound together monastics and laypeople to form a Western Society - how great was his plan! As for withdrawing those who had not abandoned worldly burdens, this was precisely the mind of Master [Hui]yuan when he declined Xie Lingyun. Savoring his entire life, like a bright moon in clear sky, not a single speck of dust was stained upon it. How fitting that at the moment of death, the light and brightness should be so magnificent! Alas, if everyone would emulate the Master and seek rebirth in the Pure Land, even ten thousand oxen could not hold them back!"

**Biography of Vinaya Master Dajue**
The Vinaya Master's name was Dajue. He was a disciple of Master Zhou. His understanding and bearing were clear and keen; he deeply explored the vinaya sections.

He established a vinaya banner at Huayan Temple in Hangzhou, and monks from all four directions all revered and looked up to him.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Lingyi of Yifeng Temple in Yuhang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Lingyi. He was born to the Wu family of Guangling. His nature and lineage were transcendent; his heart and mind were warm like spring. At the tender age of nine, he disliked the decaying dwelling and went straight into the Brahma garden. In his twentieth year he ascended the platform and received full ordination. He refined his practice of vinaya regulations, never slacking day or night. Initially he studied the *Xiangbu Vinaya* under Vinaya Master Fashen of Weiyang. Among the dragons and elephants of that generation who associated with the Master, there were extremely many. Only Tanyi, Yixuan, and Mingyou were most acclaimed as intimate friends. The Master happened to visit Liusi in Shannan County on Mount Kuaiji, where he met with Meditation Masters Yinkong and Qianjing to discuss the First Principle of Truth. He subsequently resided at Qingyun Temple and also served as abbot of Yifeng Temple in Yuhang. He compassionately nurtured the entire assembly, guiding them skillfully step by step. Those who received his teachings were like fertile fields receiving rich rain. The temple initially had no well or spring. When the Master came to reside there, a golden spring bubbled forth vigorously. Drawing from it never exhausted it. The Master's conduct and behavior were pure and strict; he despised glory and profit, cut off climbing connections, and his footsteps never entered the gates of lay households. Sometimes he sat in meditation on mountain peaks, sometimes he walked through

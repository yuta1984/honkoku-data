sixty-seven years old. The number of monastic summers is not detailed. He lectured on vinaya over forty times. Among his writings are the *Commentary on the Dharmaguptaka* in ten volumes, *Commentary on Vinaya Procedures* in three volumes, *Ritual for Abandoning Transgressions and Explanation of Light and Heavy [Offenses]*, and other works totaling several volumes. The disciples he taught numbered several people.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Xuanwan of Puguang Temple, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Xuanwan, also called Huiwan. He belonged to the Yang clan and was from Huayin in Hongnong. From childhood he was intelligent and perceptive, standing distinctly apart from ordinary people. At barely the age of "dancing elephant" (13-15 years old), he paid respects to Dharma Master Tanyan as a disciple and studied monastic practices. His diligent and reverent heart was unmatched by his peers. Eventually he received full ordination and harbored aspirations to journey south for study. Soon he heard that Vinaya Master Hongzun was teaching Dharma at Daxingshan Temple, so he specially went to pay his respects. He served diligently for three years. The principles of what to maintain and what violates precepts, what to permit and what to prohibit, the subtleties of light and heavy regulations and permissions - there was nothing he did not thoroughly comprehend. The Master's aspirations were not yet satisfied. He studied the *Nirvana Sutra* under his original teacher and received transmission of the *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* from Master Qian. As for the profound meanings contained in the *Lotus Sutra*, *Mahāvaipulya*, *Laṅkāvatāra*, *Śrīmālā*, *Daśabhūmika Śāstra*, *Madhyama* and *Śata Śāstra*, they were like pointing to his palm. From this point onward, his learning in both transformative teachings and regulatory teachings had nothing to be ashamed of. Soon he promoted the essential vehicle, with his reputation spreading throughout the four directions. Students flocked to him unanimously. Beyond his lecturing activities, he devoted his remaining energy to meritorious deeds. In the second year of Renshou, he cast a sixteen-foot golden statue of Śākyamuni. Previously, his former teacher Master Yan had intended to undertake this project but had not brought it to completion, passing away with this aspiration unfulfilled. The Master thus completed his predecessor's intention. When working the furnace and hammer, miraculously heaven rained wonderful flowers that flew and scattered like mica. That evening heavenly music filled the sky, continuing until dawn before ceasing. When the mold was opened, the compassionate countenance was serene and dignified, causing observers to feel reverence. He also built sutra repositories in four locations, with their adornments reaching the height of beauty. The Master lamented that in this age distant from the Buddha's image,

**Right Page Lower Section**
there were deficiencies in returning to the prohibitions, and regarding ordination transmission, obstructions and difficulties became increasingly manifest. He therefore solemnly decorated the meditation hall and sought out various repentance methods. Each spring at the beginning of the ordination period, he followed the thirty-five Buddhas and thousand-repetition divine mantras to purify and practice the Way. This enabled those who had violated prohibitions to trace back to the source, return to purity, ascend the ordination platform, and receive the Dharma with clear certainty and no doubt. He could truly be called a Dharma-protecting bodhisattva. By early Zhenguan, Emperor Taizong heard of the Master's transformative influence and summoned him to the palace to confer the great bodhisattva precepts upon the imperial consorts, crown prince, and various princes. There was an imperial order to establish Puguang Temple with the Master invited to be its founding abbot. Soon there was an edict for him to copy the complete Buddhist canon for the Empress at Deye Temple within the imperial garden, and also to create another canonical collection at Yanxing Temple. Both were entrusted to the Master's supervision and protection. His glory and honor reached this level. Consequently, those who admired him became even more numerous. Left Vice-Director Xiao Yu and his brothers, Right Vice-Director Du Ruhui, General Xue Wanche and his brothers including their mothers - all the distinguished nobles and eminent persons of the time either received precepts from him or sought instruction in the Way, all humbling their positions to serve him as teacher. Whenever the Master conferred precepts and expounded Dharma, various types of spirits and deities would gather as if receiving and accepting [the teachings]. Without supreme merit extending to the unseen realm, how could this be achieved? One day the Master sent a letter to enlighten and awaken the Crown Prince, saying: "As the new year begins and auspicious blessings are renewed, I humbly trust Your Highness responds to the times and receives divine protection, with all things being appropriate. However, I have long been afflicted by chronic illness and cannot participate in the celebrations. Receiving your gracious inquiry, I am unable to bear the weight of gratitude. Moved by such profound benevolent attention, I do not know how to respond. Now I briefly outline four essential matters from the sutras, hoping Your Highness will pay attention: First, practicing compassion - this means following the texts on pure conduct in the *Nirvana Sutra* to nurture and universally save. Second, reducing killing - the regular meals of the Eastern Palace involve much slaughter and preparation. Your Highness, with provisions for one person, provides for all the court officials, and all causes of taking life can be traced back to Your Highness. Please reduce killing

to extend life. Third, harmonizing with natural energy - not killing is called benevolence. Benevolence governs liver and wood. Wood belongs to spring and life. Your Highness's position corresponds to lesser yang. Please prohibit killing and abstain from meat during spring to harmonize with yang energy. Fourth, observing fasting - the three annual fasts and six monthly fasts. Why? The great blessings now enjoyed all depend on past causes. If one can further advance in virtue, beauty will increasingly multiply." The Crown Prince replied: "I am honored by your wonderful Dharma in four categories. I shall carefully treasure them in my heart, follow them in all my activities, eternally rely on these excellent causes, and use them to gain invisible protection." The remaining text is not recorded. That his words and commands were implemented reached this extent. In the ninth year an edict was issued prohibiting killing. In late winter of the tenth year, the Master suddenly developed a minor illness. He again sent a memorial to the Eastern Palace, repeatedly emphasizing the great Dharma. He also submitted a final testament, which briefly stated: "Holy emperors and enlightened kings reverently respect the Three Jewels. When monks violate laws, they should not be subject to the same penalties as common people. Please have them turned over to the appropriate authorities to be dealt with according to monastic law." He also submitted his *Treatise on Nourishing and Protecting the People* and *Treatise on Three Virtues*, one volume each. The Emperor favorably accepted them. On the seventh day of the twelfth month, he gathered the assembly and gave final admonitions, entrusting the responsibility of supporting and maintaining the Dharma gate. His words were sorrowful and moving, causing listeners to weep silently. He also said: "I give my remaining shade to all living beings. Let my remains be cremated and discarded according to ancient custom. Do not follow worldly customs and perform sacrificial rites." Having finished speaking, he passed away peacefully. He was seventy-five years old. The four assemblies grieved deeply, their voices moving the court and countryside. The Emperor sent the Crown Prince to preside over the funeral ceremonies and issued an edict saying: "Vinaya Master Xuanwan had steadfast moral conduct and clear scholarly attainments. Just as we were relying on him to broadly proclaim the True Dharma and benefit all beings, he unfortunately passed from this world. Our feelings are deeply sorrowful. Bestow gifts as separately [specified]. For the requirements of the funeral vigil and burial, arrangements shall be made by the Imperial Treasury." His disciples followed his final instructions and performed the cremation ceremony. The Emperor ordered all officials to attend the funeral. On that day white banners filled the roads, fragrant wood formed pyres, black and white robes followed in procession from the city walls all the way to Zhongnan Mountain. Throughout the forty li distance, there was no room for carriages and

**Left Page Lower Section**
horses. All said: "Our teacher has now passed away. Who will preserve the precept practices?" His spiritual remains were collected and enshrined in a pagoda at the burial site. Eastern Palace Gentleman-Attendant Xiao Jun of Lanling composed the inscription, and Minister of the Imperial Clan Li Boyao wrote the stele text to illuminate his virtue. His writings include *Gateway to Convenient Methods for Entering the Way* in two volumes, *Mirror Analogy Treatise* in one volume, *Unobstructed Dependent Origination* in one volume, *Ten Types of Sutra Recitation Procedures* in one volume, *Inexhaustible Treasury Ritual* in one volume, *Origins of Arousing Precepts* in two volumes, *Dharma Realm Diagram* in one volume, *Ten Negations Treatise* in one volume, and *Buddha Veneration Ritual* in one volume. Direct disciples he ordained, including Saṅgha and others, numbered over five hundred. Monks and nuns who received full ordination from him numbered over three thousand. From princes and court officials down to common people, those who received the refuges and precepts totaled over two hundred thousand. The Master's spiritual bearing was dignified and serious, his precept observance lofty and pure - people said that looking at his portrait inspired awe and respect.

Praise says: People who know Buddhism only know that expounding Dharma like rain and thunder awakens beings' right faith, but do not know that their loyal righteousness burns brightly, with profound devotion focused on family and state. One like Master Wan had a heart of loyalty to the ruler and love for beings as brilliant as the rising sun. Compared with [Dharma Master] Qiuna's relationship to Emperor Wen, there is nothing to distinguish between them. He could be called one who perfectly harmonized worldly and transcendent concerns without obstruction - among monks, who but the Master could be called a treasure?

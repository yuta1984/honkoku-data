**Biography of Vinaya Master Huiguang of Dajue Temple, Ye City, Northern Qi**

The Vinaya Master's name was Huiguang, son of the Yang family of Changlu in Dingzhou. His mother was from a certain clan. The Master was spiritually extraordinary from childhood, his eyes brilliant and piercing like they could shoot through people. At the age of dancing with spoons (thirteen years old), his father took him to the capital. On the Buddha's birth day, he went to Chan Master Fotuo's place and received the Three Refuges. Fotuo saw that his character and constitution were extraordinary and earnestly sought to keep him. When he taught him one sutra, he could immediately memorize it completely. It was as if he had practiced it from long ago. Fotuo expected great things of him as a perfect vessel for the Dharma treasure and had him tonsured as a disciple. Whatever scriptures he studied, there were none he did not thoroughly penetrate. He immediately expounded them for people. His Sanskrit pronunciation was clear and beautiful, his eloquence like pouring from a bottle. People of the time called him the "Holy Novice." Whenever there were donations, regardless of amount, he would distribute them as soon as he received them. Fotuo sighed and said, "This is truly the practice of a bodhisattva." The Master's refined capacity was broad and magnanimous, not constrained by petty details. Through prosperity and decline, gain and loss, he remained resoundingly unmoved within. Fotuo again sighed and said, "This novice is no ordinary person. If he receives full ordination, he should first study vinaya. Vinaya is the foundation of wisdom. Without intelligence, one cannot uphold it. If he initially relies on sutras and treatises, he will inevitably slight the precept network. Wrong views that destroy the Dharma are the source of obstacles to the Way." Therefore he taught him much vinaya study. When he had just reached twenty years of age, he said to himself, "If Chinese and Sanskrit languages don't communicate, receiving precepts cannot be accomplished." So he returned to his homeland, ascended the ordination platform, and received full ordination. At that time, Vinaya Master Daofu of Yunzhong was first promoting the *Dharmaguptaka*, and his Way resonated throughout

China and foreign lands. The Master especially went to study under Fu. Fu esteemed him like Fotuo had. After long dependence on him, he finally became his heir. Before completing four rainy seasons, he lectured on the *Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya*. His talent and eloquence were clear and inspiring, his words mysteriously united with principle. Listeners gathered like flowing rivers and surging waves. The Master's learning mind never rested. He then followed Master Bian to research sutras and treatises. Eventually he entered Luoyang capital and thoroughly mastered the sounds and characters of north and south, penetrating their subtle mysteries. He then took up brush and paper to compile what he had heard. Fotuo secretly saw this and told him: "My ordaining you was hoping you would transmit the fruition and direction. Yet now you are preoccupied with merely engaging in worldly conventional language. This is barely sufficient to become a brilliant Dharma master." The Master received this teaching and took it to heart, even to the point of shedding tears. It happened that Fotuo was appointed abbot of Shaolin Temple for translation work. The Master was included in the select group and often verified Sanskrit texts. Through this his reputation suddenly arose in monastic circles and among the gentry. People like Grand Tutor Gao Aocao, Imperial Secretary Gao Longzhi, and court minister Sima Linghu Ziru all respected him as a Buddha in a buddha-less age. When the year encountered severe drought, the Master responded to the villagers' request, went to the pond beside Mount Song, established an altar and prayed for rain. Suddenly great rain poured down like a waterfall. The year then produced a good harvest. Everyone praised this as a manifestation of spiritual power. Also when the Erzhu clan raised troops for northern campaigns, they levied taxes on monks and nuns to supply the military. They first established a strict order saying, "Those who dare to remonstrate will receive extreme punishment." The Master, considering the blockade of the five assemblies, went directly to thoroughly criticize their error. The Erzhu clan was shamed by his words and desisted. All under heaven heard this and considered it admirable. There was also a Confucian scholar named Feng Gun who had thoroughly studied various texts and came especially wanting to pose difficulties. Upon hearing the Master's lectures and chanting once, he was awed into shameful submission. He then emptied his mind to serve as student. The Master initially served as National Monastic Director in the capital region. Later he was summoned to Ye City, transferred to become National Controller, and resided at Dajue Temple. He greatly proclaimed the Way of Dharma-correctness. With one wave of his teaching staff, ten thousand fingers would surround him. One day he manifested slight illness and saw various heavens coming to welcome him. The Master said, "My only

**Left Page Upper Section**
wish is to return to the Land of Peace and Nourishment." After the heavenly beings departed for a moment, transformation buddhas of the Pure Land filled the empty sky. The Master said, "I only pray that my Buddha will embrace me and fulfill my original vow." He immediately snapped his fingers, coughed, and his words and breath together ceased. His worldly lifespan was seventy years, monastic years a certain number. The Master's bearing was lofty and bright, his wisdom and learning profound as an abyss. Day and night he dwelt in the Way, with no material accumulation even a foot in measure. He washed away filth and defilement, unchanged until the end of his physical life. His converted disciples were countless. His dharma-heir disciples numbered nineteen. Vinaya Master Daoyun was the foremost among them. His writings include commentaries on the *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya*, *Avataṃsaka*, *Nirvana*, *Vimalakīrti*, *Śrīmālā*, *Final Teaching*, *Bath House*, *Benevolent Kings*, *Prajñā*, *Ten Grounds*, *Bodhisattva Stages*, and others, along with *Revised Procedural Acts*, *Revised Precept Text*, *Profound School Treatise*, *Mahāyāna Meaning and Vinaya Chapters*, and other works totaling several dozen volumes. They were widely practiced at the time.

Praise says: Master Guang had a grand and expansive spirit, intelligent and keen divine nature. Dwelling among crowds of people, was he not like a phoenix among sparrows? When he encountered the anvil and hammer of Daofu, he became a great vessel. He brought glory and strength to the religious teachings like dawn light breaking through night. Therefore from kings and great ministers down to tough soldiers and brave men, none failed to incline their sincerity toward his transformative influence. At the moment of death, he rejected the heavenly palaces and sought the Pure Land. The firm strength of his vow-power is evident. Nanshan's words praising the Master said: "Since the correct Way pointed eastward, for great craftsmen in the world, Dao'an is considered the beginning. For revolutionizing the customs of monastics and laypeople and broadly establishing vocal teachings, Huiguang is merely second." Alas, these words are ultimate and complete! It can be said that the sage knows the sage.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Daoyun, Northern Qi**
The Vinaya Master's name was Daoyun. His established nature was lofty and transcendent, not conforming with the crowd. When he received the complete form, he became close to Vinaya Master Dajue Guang. He then inherited his dharma, becoming the sixth-generation heir of Venerable Dharma-correctness. He greatly opened the *Dharmaguptaka* school and also studied the vinayas of various schools. His way-mountain stood precipitously tall, becoming what the assembly revered. Each time he ascended the lecture hall, students would rush forward, following heel-to-toe and shoulder-to-shoulder. The Master's awesome bearing was stern and solemn, his movements and stillness had proper deportment. Even between stumbling steps, none dared violate the measuring line. His speech was kind and gentle, his words and actions consistent. His end is not detailed. His dharma-heir disciples numbered several dozen. Vinaya Master Daohong of Hebei was the foremost among them. His writings include the *Dharmaguptaka Commentary* in nine

volumes.

Praise says: Vinaya Master Daoyun, with outstanding and exceptional talent, entered the chamber of Dajue. Master and disciple united in the Way, like a goose feather meeting favorable wind or a giant fish released into the great depths. Therefore he could revive his school and leave fragrance for a thousand autumns. He was truly a worthy heir. But the generations have passed for so long that his noble conduct and remarkable traces cannot be examined in detail. Is this not also regrettable?

**Biography of the Two Vinaya Masters Daohui and Hongli, Northern Qi**
Vinaya Master Daohui's clan lineage and birth are not detailed. His temperament and intelligence were proud and unyielding, not keeping to conventional rules. Initially he entered the gate of Vinaya Master Dajue Huiguang and served him with northern-facing respect. Later he received instruction under Vinaya Master Yun's seat. He thoroughly understood the *Dharmaguptaka* and then abbreviated Yun's compositions to write a commentary in seven volumes. It became valued by the patch-robed ones. Vinaya Master Hongli became dharma-brothers with Master Hui. His aspiration and spirit were transcendent, his literary expression stern and correct. When he had discussions with people, it was like the Milky Way—one could not fathom its shores. He wrote the *Dharmaguptaka Extract* in two volumes. Later, for Zhishou's benefit, he expanded and clarified the meaning, elegantly organizing the structure and combining it into four volumes. People of the time treasured it. Therefore the saying goes:

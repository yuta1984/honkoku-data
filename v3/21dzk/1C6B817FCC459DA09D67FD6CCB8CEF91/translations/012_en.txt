At the age of seventeen he followed Wang Xuanmo and Shen Tan in northern campaigns against the barbarians. Whenever battle was joined, his heart harbored compassion. He sighed and said: "To harm others for one's own benefit is not what a benevolent person does." He then removed his armor and repented his errors. When he heard the *Ruiying Jing* (Sutra of Auspicious Responses), his sense of awakening grew even stronger. He immediately abandoned everything and went to Master Zong of Nanjian, requesting to receive the Five Precepts. During the time of Song Emperor Xiaowu, he paid respects to Chan Master Yin of Yizhou, shaved his beard and hair, and joined the ranks of monks. He was then thirty-six years old. The Chan Master gave him special encouragement and support. After receiving ordination he devoted himself exclusively to intensive study of the vinaya sections, greatly clarifying the *Daśabhāṇavāra Vinaya*. During a certain year, he went east to Jiangling and under the two masters Yin and Ju received further instruction in chan and vinaya. This was like adding vermillion and indigo colors to gathered threads. He then proceeded to the capital, where he encountered Master Ying lecturing on vinaya at Xinghuang Temple. Scholars rushed there like galloping horses. The Master went to sit under him and consulted on profound and distant matters. His words hit the essential points. No one in that assembly failed to be amazed and moved to admiration. Faxian of Dinglin Temple was present at the time and, hearing his exchanges which were pure and profound, valued him highly. He then brought him back to the mountain temple to share the teaching seat and expound the Dharma. Sengzhi of Baoan Temple in Yuhang also requested lectures on the *Daśabhāṇavāra Vinaya*. Before long he condescended to the assembly's requests and emerged into the world at Yunqi Temple. He bestowed the Dharma rain equally, moistening all roots and stems. After residing there for no great length of time, he returned to the capital. Prince Wenxuan requested him to lecture on vinaya at Puhong Temple. Students from far and near, carrying parasols and wearing straw sandals, competed to gather under his teaching wheel. He also responded to the request of Huishi of Zhufang and returned to his native place to open the Dharma. Relatives and old acquaintances all came to pay their respects. The Master guided them according to the depth and shallowness of their natural dispositions. When he announced his departure, the entire assembly tried to detain him but could not. He left and went to the capital, taking up residence at Anle Temple. He cut off worldly entanglements and devoted himself exclusively to practicing the pure conduct. In lecturing, penetrating texts, and training disciples he was diligent and never weary. He entered nirvana in the third year of Yongyuan. His worldly lifespan was seventy-two years, monastic years a certain number. The grief of monks and nuns was like losing elder siblings. The Master lectured on the *Daśabhāṇavāra Vinaya Great Text* more than forty times. His writings include the *Commentary on the Daśabhāṇavāra* in eight

volumes. His disciple Sengbian erected a stela to honor his virtue. His dharma-heir disciples were named Cong and Chao, both skilled in vinaya and renowned in their generation.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Sengyou of Jianchu Temple, Jingzhao, Qi Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Sengyou, lay surname Yu. His ancestors were from Xiapi in Pengcheng. His father lived in Jianye for generations. The Master's nature was grave and dignified; he did not associate familiarly with other children. Whenever he entered pagodas and temples, he would invariably pay homage before the Dharma King, joyfully delighting in the Way and forgetting to return home. His parents, observing that he had connections beyond the mundane world, finally allowed him to leave lay life. The Master was greatly pleased. He soon paid respects to the monk Sengfan as his teacher. At age fourteen, hearing that Dharma Master Fada of Dinglin Temple was a pillar of the Dharma gate, he went to sit under him. He applied himself earnestly for several years. When his years were complete and he received full ordination, his moral discipline became even firmer. He then went to rely on Vinaya Master Faying, concentrating his mind on the Four Vinayas, not knowing of hunger, thirst, cold, or heat. He wondrously penetrated their source. At this point his reputation suddenly surpassed that of all the senior monks. Prince Wenxuan of Jingling constantly requested him to expound on vinaya pure precepts, and students who came hastening with bare feet often numbered nearly a thousand. During Yongming, by edict of Emperor Wu he entered Wu and was appointed to the position of senior monk to serve as a model for the five assemblies. The standards of conduct became orderly because of him. The Master by nature had skillful thinking and could make accurate mental calculations. Even when craftsmen followed his specifications, the measurements were never off. Therefore, the great image at Mount Guangzhai, the stone Buddha of Shan County, and others all requested the Master to undertake their beginning and to set the standards for their proportions. When Emperor Wu of Liang ascended the throne, his favor and kindness increased even more. Whenever there were doubtful and difficult matters concerning monastic affairs, or cases that were not easy to decide, they would all be referred to him by imperial edict for careful decision. When the Master grew old and suffered from leg ailments, by imperial edict he was permitted to enter the inner palace in a shoulder-carried litter to administer precepts to the Six Palaces. His esteem by the current ruler was like this. Prince Hong of Linchuan, Prince Wei of Nanping, Yitong of the Chen commandery

Yuan Ang, Princess Yongkang Ding, and Noble Consort Lady Ding all revered his moral example and observed the etiquette of disciples. Even figures like Zhizang of Kaishan Temple and Huikuo of Fayin Temple also regarded the Master as supremely important. Whatever donations the Master received, he used entirely to repair major monasteries like Dinglin and Jianchu temples, establish unlimited great assemblies, body-abandoning fasts, and the like, as well as to set up sutra repositories, search and collate scroll texts, enable pagodas and temples to open widely, and prevent the Dharma teachings from being lost. This was through the Master's power. On the twenty-sixth day of the fifth month of the seventeenth year of Tianjian, he demonstrated passing away at Jianchu Temple. He wore monk's robes for fifty-three years and enjoyed bodily life for seventy-four years. His disciples honored his cast-off form and buried him in the old tomb of Dinglin west of Kaishan Road. His black-robed and white-robed disciples numbered more than eleven thousand and one hundred. His dharma-transmitting chief disciples Zhengdu and others numbered a certain amount. The Master's writings include *Records of the Collection from the Three Piṭakas*, *Collection of the Dharma Garden*, *Records of the World*, *Transmission of Sarvāstivādin Masters and Disciples*, *Life of Śākyamuni*, *Collection for Promoting Clarity*, *Records of the Great Assembly and Other Three Sūtras*, *Records of the Sutra of the Wise and Foolish*, *Collection of Records of Three Piṭaka Causes and Conditions*, *Records of the Five Vinaya Divisions*, *Records of Four Divisions of Sūtras Coming to Chinese Territory*, *Records of Eighteen Vinaya Divisions*, *Records of Five Hundred Arhats of the Daśabhāṇavāra Vinaya*, *Records of the Samantapāsādikā Commentary*, totaling seventy-two volumes. Liu Xie of Dongguan composed a stela recording his virtue.

Praise says: Master You's moral example was firm and upright, his wisdom and learning profound and deep. He propagated the teachings of the school and served as model and leader for humans and gods. Above he received imperial favor and his reputation became ever more illustrious. Therefore both clergy and laity were moved and responded to him, delighting in and returning to him, like the morning breeze reaching the northern forest, dragons and fish approaching deep marshes. Moreover, he established jeweled monasteries and adorned stone Buddhas, causing people to turn from evil and move toward good. Ah, only those who ride the wheel of vows and arrive could accomplish this. To call him a reincarnation of Saṃgharakṣa would certainly not be false.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Facong of the Northern Temple at Wutai, Northern Wei Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Facong. His family name and clan are not recorded in detail. He received the Dharma lineage from Venerable Fashi. His spiritual energy was keen and quick, his manifold abilities were naturally bestowed by heaven. After being tonsured and receiving full ordination, he broadly studied the Three Piṭakas, being especially profound in vinaya. During the Yanxing period he expanded the vinaya teaching seat. Before this, students throughout the realm, having no way to distinguish the true sources and currents of the teachings, received their ordination substance from the *Dharmaguptaka*, recited the prātimokṣa from the *Mahāsāṃghika*, and in their conduct followed the *Daśabhāṇavāra*. By the time of Northern Wei, the *Mahāsāṃghika* was particularly flourishing. One day the Master sighed and said: "Since the substance is received through the *Dharmaguptaka*, how can conduct be clarified through a different school?" He then traced back to the source, investigated the root, determined the substance and distinguished the conduct. He finally ceased lecturing on the *Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya* and began propagating the *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya*. From this point the entire assembly changed their perspective, the four directions looked up with respect, and his reputation in the Way became increasingly weighty throughout the realm. He advocated the way of orthodox Dharma, making reception and conduct mutually supportive. This truly began with the Master. Later no one knew of his end. There was one chief dharma-heir named Vinaya Master Daofu.

Praise says: In receiving precepts, vows and conduct must be mutually supportive. How could there be a case where the vow-substance depends on a provisional school while conduct follows true teachings? Vinaya Master Facong, with the bearing of a supreme sage, mysteriously inherited Kāla's intention and was greatly able to develop and surpass. His single statement - "Since the substance is received through the *Dharmaguptaka*, how can conduct be clarified through a different school?" - encompassed all students of later generations throughout the realm. The tradition says: "How extensive is the benefit of a noble person's words!" Is this not what is meant? Someone asked: "Since it is a matter of determining substance and distinguishing conduct, why did Venerable Kāla translate the *Mahāsāṃghika Prātimokṣa* to supplement the conduct of the *Dharmaguptaka*?" I replied: "The patriarch of the Zhiyuan school said: 'The propagation by great beings is not what ordinary minds can fathom. Matters begin at their source, transformation exists through gradual progression.' Just as when Kāśyapa Mātaṅga and Dharmaratna came to Han China, scholars and commoners followed like clouds. Though they took tonsure

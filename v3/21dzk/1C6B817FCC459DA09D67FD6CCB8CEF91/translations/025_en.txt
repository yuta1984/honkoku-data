He responded to this selection. Though he received honored recognition, he paid it no mind. Suddenly he sighed and said: "A true man should contend with others in great monasteries. How can I be confined within this tiny mouse hole?" He departed and traveled south, entering under the tutelage of the Two Vinaya Masters Shuo and Li to study the vinaya. In less than a year, he completely mastered the profound mysteries of all sections. He immediately gave review lectures before the assembly. From this point his reputation blazed forth brilliantly, and none among his contemporaries failed to respect and defer to him. At that time various temples had petty disputes like "mouse teeth and sparrow horns," and all requested the Master to resolve them. When the Master skillfully took his seat, all naturally felt joy and sincere submission in their hearts, praising his skillful mastery of the principle of non-contention. In the second year of Longshuo, he received an imperial edict to expound the Dharma at Tiangong Temple in the Eastern Capital. In early Linde, the chief administrator Han Xiaowei, claiming imperial command, built a statue of Laozi on Mount Mang and wanted to make the monks and nuns of prefectures and counties pay ceremonial homage. The Master stepped forward from the assembly and said with stern countenance: "The Buddhist and Daoist traditions have been fundamentally separate since ancient times. How can they be mixed together indiscriminately? Since there is no imperial edict, I dare not heed this command." Wei became greatly angry and said: "What kind of monk dares to refuse a national command?" He then had people remove the Master's robe and was about to impose punishment. The Master said: "This robe was granted by imperial ordination. Without an imperial edict, it cannot be arbitrarily removed." Wei angrily said: "Let any monks who will not escort the Heavenly Worthy come forward." The Master immediately stepped forward and stood alone. At this, all the monks and nuns simultaneously went to the Master's side. Wei angrily said: "Do you monks wish to rebel?" The Master raised his voice and spoke to the officials of the Six Boards: "The chief administrator has summoned all monks and nuns and speaks of rebellion. This means the chief administrator himself is rebelling. The monks and nuns are not rebelling. This must be reported to the Imperial Censor." Wei became greatly alarmed and fearful, descended the steps, bowed humbly, apologized shamefully and stopped. Such was his sternness. Also, because of a great gathering of monks to examine and ordain people, Tiangong Temple's meal offering came only after midday. Some monks ate it. The Master said to them: "All great virtuous ones are entrusted with the Buddha-Dharma and are models for the world. To eat non-timely food in front of laypeople is to publicly

violate the Dharma and vinaya. This is a sign of the Dharma's destruction - how has it come to this?" Those who heard were ashamed. The Master then requested water and rinsed his mouth, not eating for over a month. This was because he grieved over the decline of monastic standards and loss of proper conduct. Monastics and laypeople earnestly implored him, and the Master, having no choice, finally resumed eating. Among the outstanding talents of the Eastern regions, none failed to respect his character and submit to his wisdom. Later, the place of his death is not detailed.

Praise says: Song monk Zhong, when receiving guests, would not eat if the sun had passed its zenith even slightly. Qi monk Hou, if his foot's shadow was slightly askew, would pass the day fasting. Such was the precision and strictness of the ancients. Master Dao grieved over the decline and corruption of the true Dharma and did not eat for over a month. His pure conduct and lofty principles can be compared in quality to precious jade and autumn frost. He was one who became ever more precise and ever more strict. Alas! If not eating when the sun's shadow differs slightly still inspires such vigor, what would Master Dao think upon seeing those who take pleasure in night meals and late cooking?

**Biography of Vinaya Master Tanguang of Jing'ai Temple, Luozhou, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Tanguang, born of the Zhang family, from Bianzhou. From childhood to adulthood, his will and conduct were lofty and pure. After shaving his head and receiving precepts, he visited famous masters everywhere. He then studied under the Two Vinaya Masters Li and Shuo, becoming renowned for his mastery of the Vinaya Piṭaka. Li sighed and said: "The flourishing of our lineage may well depend on this young man in the future." Soon he followed Dharma Master Yu to study the *Lotus Sūtra* and *Daśabhūmika Treatise*, penetrating their profound principles and harmonizing provisional and ultimate teachings. Before long he entered under Chan Master Xiang of Mount Song to study calm-abiding and insight meditation, shutting out worldly dust and dwelling in transcendence. When Tiangong Temple in the Eastern Capital had a vacant position, a special edict appointed the Master to fill it. Thus he expounded the great Dharma like rivers and seas raising clouds that transform in moments, with great rains pouring abundantly in all directions. Students in robes flocked to him, all receiving Dharma benefit. Among those who could be observed in the halls and chambers were Jun Du of Ximing and others. Later, the place of his death is not detailed.

**Biography of Great Master Chengzhao of Fengde Temple, Zhongnan Mountain, Tang**
The Great Master's posthumous name was Daoxuan, courtesy name Fabian, from Jingzhao, family name Qian, descendant of Qian Rang, Grand Administrator of Guangling. His father's name was Lord Shen, who served the Chen Dynasty as Minister of Personnel. The Master was his eldest son. His mother was Lady Yao, who dreamed of a white moon penetrating her bosom, and upon awakening found herself pregnant. She also dreamed of a Sanskrit monk who told her: "The one you carry is Vinaya Master Sengyou of Liang. You is actually Sengshu of Southern Qi. He should be allowed to leave home and widely propagate the Buddhist teaching." The Master remained in the womb for twelve months and was born on the eighth day of the fourth month of the sixteenth year of Kaihuang of Sui. At nine he was skilled in literary composition and broadly learned in books and history. Everyone both revered and loved him. When he reached the age of dancing elephants [thirteen], weary of worldly life he entered Riyan, serving Dharma Master Huiying and studying supramundane teachings. It was as if a blue lotus transcended muddy waters and stood gracefully upright. All Buddhist activities he accomplished without learning. At sixteen he memorized the *Daigoku Sūtra*, completing it in twenty days. All other sūtras and texts he could recite from memory and understood their meaning and import. Ying, seeing his natural faculties were sharp and quick with "thousand-li-in-a-day" momentum, immediately shaved his head and made him a disciple. At this time the Master was seventeen. He practiced austerities and strengthened his resolve, seeking only the sacred Dharma. He would wear a precious reliquary box and circumambulate the pagoda practicing the Way, praying that relics would descend into the box. He set a period of seven days, and indeed received a miraculous response. In the eleventh year of Daye, the Master was

twenty years old. He followed Vinaya Master Zhishou of Hongfu, ascended the platform and received the precepts of no-vows. His practice surpassed snow and frost, his will was firm as metal and stone. He wore hemp clothing spring and winter without change. He sat long without sleeping. Daily he ate only one meal with equanimity. When walking he necessarily took quick steps. When sitting he did not lean on the bed. During the Wude years, he again followed Master Shou to study vinaya. After hearing it just once, he immediately wanted to practice meditation. Ying scolded him saying: "Precepts pure, concentration clear - cultivation and abandonment have their time. Having just begun listening and not yet being at ease, how can you recognize what to maintain and what to abandon? You should concentrate on listening. I myself will manage monastic affairs for you." He insisted that he listen twenty times. The Master studied intensively day and night, examining the subtle and minute details down to silkworm threads and ox hairs. Not only was he precise in vinaya, but for all texts such as the *Lotus*, *Nirvana*, *Laṅkāvatāra*, *Śrīmālā*, *Mahāprajñāpāramitā*, and others, he could harmonize and understand their most profound and subtle meanings. He had a flourishing reputation as one whose blue surpassed indigo and whose ice surpassed water. None of his fellow students failed to respect and submit to him. The Master withdrew to Fangzhang Valley in Zhongnan. His dwelling lacked good drinking water. A divine being pointed to the ground and said: "You should dig a well here." Digging the earth about a foot, a spiritual spring gushed forth, sweet and pure, surpassing the ordinary. The Master therefore built a Buddhist temple, naming it after the White Spring. Sitting peacefully there, from bright dawn to dusky evening, he made meditation his only occupation. Wild beasts became tame and submissive like domestic animals. During the retreat period, the Master would often offer sincere prayers: if the summer retreat bore fruit, he wished for extraordinary signs to appear. Later, indeed, sacred mushrooms grew in the courtyard. Soon he moved to Chongyi Temple in Jingzhao. Before long he transferred to Fengde Temple on Nanshan. He constantly experienced heavenly beings bringing meals and serving as guards. Sometimes they offered a box of extraordinary flowers, shaped like jujube blossoms, large as elm pods, with fragrant aroma that did not change for several years. Sometimes they supplied rare fruits, sweet in taste and pure in color, truly not of this human world. One day a heavenly being told the Master: "Qinggong Village is the site of the former Jinye Temple. You should

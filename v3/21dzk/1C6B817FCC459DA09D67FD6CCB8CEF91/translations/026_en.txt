Here you should establish a Dharma banner." The Master approved this request. He also built and expanded and moved there. In the fourth year of Zhenguan, he set a ninety-day period to practice the *Pratyutpannasamādhi* (constantly walking meditation). At that time there were groups of dragons, both male and female, who changed form to become human and came to pay respects and listen to the Dharma. A novice monk developed lustful thoughts and gazed at the female dragon. The dragon became terrifyingly angry and was about to seize and attack him. Remembering the Master's teachings and admonitions, he immediately ceased his evil thoughts. The dragon absorbed its poison and spat it into the well, informing the Master not to drink that water. The Master then ordered it to be sealed. His disciples sometimes wanted to reveal hidden matters, but the Master had already secretly understood them. Using meditative concentration to observe the situation, he taught the Dharma according to what was appropriate. Was he not like a healing king physician who gives medicine according to the illness? Also, while at Yunji Temple practicing the *Pratyutpannasamādhi*, people witnessed heavenly children serving and attending him on all sides. The Master practiced this samādhi a total of twenty sessions over the years. In the nineteenth year, together with Dharma Master Xuanzang, he translated sūtras at Hongfu. In brush reception and text polishing, he was promoted to be the assembly leader. The Sanskrit monks sighed and said: "He is a bodhisattva of the Eastern Land." During the Yonghui period, he resided at Zhuma Hermitage. Forgetting his body for the sake of the Dharma, he gradually developed worldly ailments. The Heavenly King Vaiśravaṇa taught him the method of preparing medicinal pills. This is the present "Heavenly King Heart-Supplementing Pills." This medicine has miraculous effects and has the power to restore youth and extend life. There was a hermit named Sun Simiao who chose to dwell in Zhongnan and formed a transcendental friendship with the Master. Sometimes they would meet to discuss profound matters, and all under heaven held both in high regard. In the first year of Xianqing, Emperor Gaozong newly built Ximing Temple and issued an edict making the Master the First Seat. The Master declined and would not arise. The Emperor sent Grand Herald Liu Shen to earnestly request him. The Master had no choice but to reluctantly comply. He greatly proclaimed the Way of Dharma密, and people came rushing from far and near. Thus his fame thundered forth, reaching throughout the Five Indias. When Tripiṭaka Master Wuwei arrived in the Eastern regions, he first went to the imperial palace. The Emperor asked: "Coming from ten thousand li away, are you not weary? Where would you like to rest?" The Tripiṭaka replied: "When I was in

India, I heard that Vinaya Master Xuan of Ximing Temple was foremost in upholding [the precepts]. I wish to go and take refuge with him." The Emperor issued an edict permitting this. From this we can know how the Master was admired and longed for by people. One evening while the Master was practicing walking meditation, as he approached the stone steps his foot stumbled. Suddenly a young man in armor appeared to support him. The Master looked and said: "Who are you?" He replied: "I am the Swift Messenger under the Southern Heavenly King." The Master said: "Who are those around you?" He replied: "I am Nazha, son of Heavenly King Vaiśravaṇa. Because of the Master's lofty and sublime virtue in precepts, I have received my father the king's command to constantly come and protect you." The Master said: "This poor monk has no virtue to trouble the Prince. Since the Prince has sovereign spiritual powers, if there are things in the Western Regions that could serve Buddhist works, I wish you would bring them." He said: "Your disciple has a Buddha tooth, three inches long and one inch wide. I have treasured it for a long time. Even my head and eyes I would offer - how much more other things?" He then gave it to the Master. The Master treasured, protected and made offerings to it. During the day he hid it in an earth cave, at night he held it while practicing walking meditation. No one could know this. Only his disciple Wengang secretly saw his traces and wanted to publicize this. The Master warned him saying: "Worldly people have shallow roots of faith. If you spread this, they would certainly consider me demonic. My child, be careful not to leak this outside." During the Longshuo years he lectured on the *Laṅkāvatāra* at Jinye Temple. Dragons transformed into human form and came several times to listen secretly. One day he entered his room and briefly napped. A novice peeked and saw a red dragon, extremely long and large. Frightened, he reported to the Master. The Master warned him not to tell anyone. In the second year of Qianfeng, at Jinye Temple he built a precept platform. He personally carried earth and built it according to the vinaya. At the completion ceremony, the Long-browed Arhat and Venerable Piṇḍola descended and visited. They bowed to the platform and sighed: "Since the Buddha's nirvana, during the Age of the Semblance Dharma abiding in the world, only the Master alone has promoted and developed the vinaya." They discussed vinaya together, spending the entire day before departing. At that time, ocean-like multitudes gathered like rivers, with joyful voices thundering like lightning. It seemed like a living Buddha appearing in the world. Virtuous worthies from throughout the realm all came to receive additional **precept

grades**. One day a heavenly being came to the Master's room door, treading softly and making a sound. The Master asked: "What patron is this?" He replied: "Your disciple's surname is Zhang, name Qiong. I am the Southern Heavenly King's fifteenth son. The king has ninety-one sons, all heroic, martial and spiritually skillful. Each protects cities and regions, supporting and maintaining the true teaching." The Master said: "Welcome, good to meet you. Why don't you enter within the gate?" He said: "Without receiving the Master's permission, I dare not enter rashly." The Master said: "Come in and take a seat." After entering, he respectfully bowed and sat. The Master said: "You have received the Buddha's entrustment to protect the Three Jewels. Now you have come to visit me. Why do you not show your true form?" He replied: "Your disciple's reward body is different from other people's. If I showed it, it would certainly startle and disturb the minds of the multitude. Only conversing with the Master is sufficient. Why should I manifest my body?" He also said: "Master, this year your life span is about to end. You should be born in the Tuṣita Inner Court." He then offered a package of incense saying: "This is genuine produce from the heavenly thorny forest. It is what Indra burns." The Master said: "Who came with you?" He replied: "This is your disciple's third elder brother, named Yu. His total wisdom is transcendent and he has faith and reverence in the Buddhist school. He has personally compiled over a hundred volumes of *Jetavana Illustrated Sūtra*." The Master then received it orally and obtained an abstract in two volumes, upper and lower. The heavenly being further announced: "The errors in weight and importance in the abstract text are all mistakes of translation, not the Master's fault. Please, Master, make corrections." Therefore, most of the writings now in circulation are revised versions. There was also a heavenly being surnamed Wei, named Kun - this is General Wei. He is one of the eight great generals under the Southern Heavenly King. Each of the Four Great Heavenly Kings has thirty-two generals, with Wei leading them. He constantly resided there protecting and assisting the Master. Regarding the Master's regulations, standards, procedures, and determinations of gravity and lightness in the vinaya, where there had been doubts in the past that remained unresolved, [Wei] followed to consult and resolve them. Thus he described the sacred traces of this land and the holy sites of the Western regions - approximately 3,800 items. He organized these into ten volumes, titled *Records of Spiritual Communications*. He also once composed a preface to the *Lotus Sūtra*. At that time, Heavenly General Wei said that the *Lotus* was **supremely honored** and not easy to preface with words, so he reported to the Buddhas of the ten directions. All the Buddhas gave their approval before the preface was transmitted.

The present *Preface for Wide Transmission* is this one. One day the Master looked at his disciples and said: "I am about to depart. You should bury me in the stone chamber of Altar Valley." In an instant, banners, streamers and jeweled canopies spread like clouds and arranged like stars. Music, incense and flowers filled the air. Heavenly beings and sage assemblies came from Tuṣita Heaven, with one voice requesting the Master [to come]. The Master sat upright with palms joined, composed his appearance and passed into tranquility. Those who witnessed it marveled at this rare occurrence. It was actually the third day of the tenth month of Qianfeng Dingmao year. His worldly lifespan was seventy-two years, monastic years fifty-two. On the evening of cremation, they obtained śarīra relics from among the ashes and cinders. His disciples followed his dying instructions and built a stupa in the stone chamber of Altar Valley. Afterwards, stupas were erected in three locations. The Emperor personally heard of his final affairs at the crane grove and praised endlessly with admiration. He then issued an edict to temples and monasteries throughout the realm to paint portraits of the Master and make offerings. From when the Master ascended the ordination platform until the day of his nirvana, the number of those who came from the four directions to study vinaya cannot be known. His ordained disciples including Daci and others numbered over one thousand. Those who received his Dharma and dwelt separately in various temples included Chongsheng, Wengang and several dozen others. The Buddha tooth that the heavenly beings had entrusted to him was secretly kept under Wengang's protection and taken to the eastern stupa of Chongsheng Temple. Among his visible writings are: *Practice Manual* in twelve volumes; *Ritual Procedures According to Circumstances*, *Annotated Precept Text*, and *Collection of Vinaya Meanings* - three volumes each; *Ritual Procedure Commentary* and *Precept Text Commentary* - eight volumes each; *Revised Monk Precept Text* and *Revised Nun Precept Text* - one volume each; *Bhikṣuṇī Manual* in six volumes; *Lotus Sūtra Meaning Garden* in thirty volumes; *Vestment Procedures*, *Records of Spiritual Communications*, *Teaching and Precept Procedures*, *Precept Platform Illustrated Sūtra*, *Buddhist Gate Reverence Procedures*, *Procedures for Judging Light and Heavy [Offenses]*, *Six-Time Buddha Worship and Repentance Procedures* - one volume each; *Pure Mind Precept Contemplation*, *Jetavana Illustrated Sūtra*, and *Genealogy of the Śākya Clan* - two volumes each; *Expanded Hongming Collection*, *Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks* - each [incomplete at page end]

Preface

　The lineage of Western masters traces back from Dharmakāla to Kāśyapa, totaling six generations. The present biographies begin from Dharmakāla onward, as Kāla was the founding patriarch of the Vinaya in China.
　Chinese masters number over 220 in total. Among these, over 130 biographies are taken from the Three Dynasty Monk Histories with additional embellishments. Over 90 biographies are compiled from various family records and stupa inscriptions.
　Japan's Buddhist writings in the "Myōkai-hen" (Chapter on Clarifying Precepts) record only ten persons. The present biographies add over 120 additional persons, all compiled from surviving documents, separate records, fragmentary texts and phrases, and oral traditions and legends. Readers should know that these have basis.
　The masters in these biographies are divided into Chinese and Japanese sections, each arranged according to ordination seniority. This means not distinguishing between great family background, extensive learning, Dharma masters, Vinaya holders, Zen masters, etc., but simply ordering precedence according to the sequence of receiving precepts.
　From the Cao Wei dynasty to the present, over 1,300 years have passed. During this time, those born into this world who propagated and spread this Way number in the tens of millions. This compilation particularly records only what is known. If one wished to record everything completely, one should await gentlemen scholars of antiquity.

　　Biography of Venerable Dharmakāla of Luoyang, Cao Wei Dynasty
Venerable Dharmakāla means "Dharma Time" in Chinese. He was a person from Central India. His family name is not known in detail. His family was wealthy for generations and constantly cultivated Buddhist merit. The Venerable was extraordinary from childhood, with keen intelligence surpassing others, majestic bearing and appearance, and profound talent. He could grasp the literary meaning of poetry and books at a glance, and most thoroughly mastered the Four Vedas and Five Sciences. Wind, clouds, stars, divination, and changes of fortune—there was nothing he did not comprehensively understand. At age twenty-five, he happened to enter a monk's chamber and glimpsed the *Abhidharmahṛdaya*, but was bewildered and did not understand its meaning. He sighed and said: "I have perused many books for several years. I thought all the principles of literature under heaven were stored in my heart and mind. Now seeing Buddhist books, they are completely beyond my expectations. There must be separate essential points." So he took the scroll to a bhikṣu and sought to hear its profound mysteries. After hearing, he was suddenly enlightened. For the first time he knew that Buddhist teaching was supreme and victory that worldly books could not reach. He immediately renounced the world and became a monk.
After rigorous practice and receiving the precepts, he recited Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna sūtras and various Vinaya texts, thoroughly understanding their essential meaning. He constantly made teaching and guidance his heart's purpose, without attachment to his homeland. During the Jiaping era of Wei, he arrived in Luoyang. At that time, although the Wei territory had Buddhism, the Way's customs had become corrupted. There were also many monks who had not yet received the precepts of refuge, but only distinguished themselves from laypeople by shaving their heads. Their performance of fasting and repentance ceremonies was the same as ancestral worship. The Venerable then reformed the previous

corrupt practices and greatly erected the banner of true orthodoxy. He stood firm as the standard for the southeast. Students coming from the four directions moved like thunder and rose like clouds, competing to request translation and transmission of the precepts. The Venerable thought that since Buddhism was not yet flourishing, he feared they could not accept and use the complete Vinaya. Therefore he translated the *Saṃghika Vinaya Heart* to suit the times. He then invited Sanskrit monks to produce the *Karmavācanā* and, following the Dharmaguptaka school, performed ten-monk ordination. Chinese Vinaya truly began at this time. The Venerable's end cannot be fathomed.

Praise says: The entry of orthodox teaching into China began in the reign of Emperor Ming of Han. Extending to Cao Wei was nearly two hundred years. During this time, although there were tonsured monks, they had never received the Five or Eight Precepts, much less the full ordination issued through the fourfold *saṅghakamma*. Venerable Dharma Time observed the situation and came east, relying on the Dharmaguptaka school to first establish the ceremony for bhikṣus. He made the true customs and excellent standards shine brilliantly in the world chapter by chapter. He can be called like the udumbara flower manifesting one branch in its time. In the 1,300 years since then, there is no disciple of Śākyamuni under heaven who has not received his excellent beneficence. Ah, to initiate great undertakings and establish merit for ten thousand generations—if not a bodhisattva of the stages, he must be an emanation of Upāli. How magnificent!

　　Biography of Venerable Dharmakṣema of Chang'an, Jin Dynasty
Venerable Dharmakṣema means "Dharma Joy" in Chinese, also called "Dharma Hope." He was from South India in the Western Regions.
He abandoned worldly glory and transcendently entered the Way. After receiving full ordination, he became renowned particularly through the Vinaya Piṭaka. In the seventh year of Hongshi, he arrived in Guanzhong. Dharma Master Huiyuan of Mount Lu heard that the Venerable was proficient in Vinaya and sent his disciple Tanyong with a letter saying: "The flourishing of Buddhist teaching first took place in the superior country. Since the division and spreading

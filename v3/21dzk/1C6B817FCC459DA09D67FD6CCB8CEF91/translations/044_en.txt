**Biography of Vinaya Master Shencou of Xingguo Temple in Jiangzhou**
The Vinaya Master's name was Shencou. He was a son of the Cheng family from Lantian in Jingzhao. Born with extraordinary refinement, he left the dusty world in his youth. At twenty-three he received full ordination from Vinaya Master Xicao of Nanyue. He mastered both transformative and regulatory teachings without exception. He was particularly expert in the Four-Part Vinaya. He also studied under Chan Master Daji of Zhongling and investigated the principle of direct transmission. In the eighth year of Dali, the court used examinations in the three subjects of sutra, vinaya, and abhidharma to test scholars throughout the realm who wished to become monks. The Master was selected. By imperial edict he was assigned to Xingguo Temple in Jiangzhou. Later he followed the monastic community and moved to Donglin Temple - the very monastery of Master Yuan of Yanmen. The Sweet Dew Ordination Platform was located there. He continued to promote Buddhist activities, and his transformative guidance was most flourishing. The Master's conduct and principles transcended the mundane. His observance of vinaya was extremely strict. His rising, resting, movement and stillness all had constant regularity. He ate from one bowl and dwelt on one couch. Wearing hemp robes and sleeping on sedge grass, he was like one sitting in a lacquer room. Throughout the twelve periods of day and night he practiced the Way and venerated the Buddha. Even through bitter cold and intense heat he never once neglected this. He continued thus for over forty years. All donations he received were entirely returned to the monastery's inexhaustible treasury and shared with the great assembly. His form and appearance were naturally gaunt and emaciated. Looking at him, he appeared so frail as if unable to bear his robes. When disciples offered him medicine, he waved them away. On the twenty-sixth day of the ninth month of the twelfth year of Yuanhe, he contracted illness and passed away in sitting meditation. He lived seventy-four years with fifty-one years in the dharma. That year on the nineteenth day of the tenth month, his disciples respectfully enshrined his whole body in a stupa at the home temple. His dharma-heir disciples included Daojian, Liben, Yuanshen, Yuanzong and several others. When Bai Juyi served as prefectural vice-governor, he had maintained a transcendent friendship with the Master throughout his life. At this time he composed a stupa inscription and also composed a verse to mourn him, saying: "Originally we formed a bodhi incense and fire society, together despising this body of afflictions like electric bubbles. Do not need to be melancholy and follow the Master in departure.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Huiling of Shengshou Temple in Jingzhao**

When he received the precept grades, he sharpened his resolve toward vinaya. His practice and understanding supported each other, and through this his reputation became lofty. Everyone revered and feared him like a divine being. In the seventh year of Dazhong, Emperor Xuanzong visited Zhuangyan Temple to venerate the Buddha tooth. He then climbed the great pagoda and looked in all directions. Seeing ruins to the northwest he said: "This was formerly Zongchi Temple." He was melancholy for a long time. He issued an edict to question the elderly about past events. The assembly recommended the Master to respond. The emperor praised his detailed clarity and

bestowed dharma robes upon him. He also issued an edict to restore Zongchi Temple. Thereupon workers flowed in like rivers. Construction began on the eleventh day of the third month and was completed on a certain day of the sixth month. The Master respectfully accepted the imperial command to serve as director. The vinaya regulations were solemn and the pure assembly was all well-ordered. The emperor was greatly pleased and frequently added special commendations.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Baoyu Lin of Yongfu Temple in Qiantang**
The Vinaya Master's taboo name was Huiling, courtesy name Baoyu. His lay surname was Ke. He was from Xin'an. In childhood he took refuge with Master Jin of Lingyin as a disciple. Once he studied doctrinal texts he was immediately able to understand them thoroughly. At the beginning of Dali he received full ordination at the Vulture Peak Assembly. The three studies were unified without regret. His nature delighted in springs and rocks, viewing fame, reputation and material support as lightly as if they were nothing. He dwelt in seclusion at Tianyan - that is, Tianmu. The mountain rises three thousand zhang high with a circumference of three hundred li, similar to Tianzhu and Lufu. For those who climb it, it takes several days to reach. The terrain is deep, secluded and full of supernatural phenomena. Above are two lakes called East and West Eyes. There are also three pools where dragons run rampant - people cannot approach. Every year in the fifth month, the mountain spirit changes form into a white deer and meets with the dragon of Zhenze. At this time wind and rain are most violent. The Master lived there for over twenty years in all, completely without fear. In the second year of Yuanhe, Prefect Du Zhi of the Ministry of Rites from south of the city revered the Master's virtue and requested him to come down from the mountain to reside at Yongfu Temple in Qiantang. He ascended the platform to ordain people for four years. Prefectural Governor Pei Changdi of the Ministry of War invited him to preside over the ordination platform at Tianzhu Temple. Before long he declined and returned to Yongfu. Beyond cultivating practice, he specialized diligently in teaching and explanation. He encouraged students and exhausted all skillful means. For nearly twenty years his lofty and pure conduct never changed from beginning to end. Among the

**Left Page Lower Section**
scholar-officials of that time, Secretariat Drafter Bai Juyi, Chief Minister of the Court of Imperial Granaries Li Yougong and others all paid respectful visits and personally inquired about essential dharma. On the twenty-fifth day of the fourth month of the sixth year of Taihe he demonstrated extinction. His lay lifespan was eighty-three, his monastic years sixty-four. His disciples buried him on the twelfth day of the fifth month of that year on the south side of West Mountain of Yong'an Temple, to the left of Agate Slope.

The eulogy says: Master Cou practiced the Way and venerated Buddha throughout the twelve periods - his precision and diligence could not be exceeded. Master Cui's talent and aspiration were unmatched in the group, with great merit for the ancestral teaching. Master Ye sought the dharma without shaming his teacher. Master Ling's learning and practice were both lofty - the reason he won imperial favor was not coincidental. That Master Lin dwelt alone at Tianmu for twenty years was truly difficult.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Congli of Pingtian Temple on Mount Tiantai, Later Tang**

His hometown praised him considerably. When he lost his parents, he resolved to become a monk. At that time he was already advanced in years.

Within less than a year, his studies were completed. He maintained the vinaya standards with precision, never transgressing even in moments of haste or distress. During the Qianhua years, he traveled to Mount Tiantai and planted his staff at Pingtian Temple. The entire assembly elected him as first seat. The Master was prudent and dignifiedly silent, never showing joy or anger in his countenance. He received people with compassion and forbearance. At every *posatha* ceremony he admonished the assembly to protect and cherish the floating bag [of precepts]. Moreover he said: "The *Pratimoksha* is our great teacher. You should know that for one who has left home, without the precepts it is like an elephant without a hook or an ape freed from chains." His listeners were moved and submitted.

At night he always sat and never lay down. On a certain day in the eleventh month of the third year of Tongguang, he serenely entered nirvana.

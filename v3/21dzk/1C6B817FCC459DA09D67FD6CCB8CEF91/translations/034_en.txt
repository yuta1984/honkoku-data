Many followed him in scholarly association. Such figures as Junior Protector and Duke of Yan Lu Xiangxian, Guest Receptor He Zhizhang, Li Yong of Beihai, Secretary Xu Anzhen, and Remonstrance Official Chu Tinghui were closest to the Master, forming bonds of perfect friendship. This was no less than the gathering of Zhi Daoling and Xu Xun at Xujia, or the assembly of Huiyuan and Lei Cizong at Mount Lu. In the twenty-fifth year of Kaiyuan, he took up his staff and returned east. The following year the court issued an edict to establish Kaiyuan Temple. Prefect Zhang Chu recommended the Master to head it. He greatly promoted the Way and Dharma, his reputation spreading through court and countryside. Those who came with frost-wrapped staffs and rain hats were like clouds, fearing to be late. The Master received and guided them according to their spiritual capacity, showing not the slightest sign of weariness. Buddhist disciples of the Yangtze and Huai regions considered that unless one had once ascended his ordination platform, one could not be considered to have obtained the Dharma. In the fourteenth year of Tianbao, the tides of the Zhe River surged south to Qiantang. The Great Cloud Monastery was in the path of these rushing torrents, and the entire community was greatly worried, seeking rescue from the Master. The Master led a thousand students in lecturing on vinaya and reciting the Prajñāpāramitā to bring merit to the Dragon King Wuxu. On the last night of the fifth month, in a trance-like state, he saw a divine being magnificently clothed and capped, who bowed and apologized saying: "Having received the Master's Dharma offering, I shall now change the course of the waves." Before long white sand welled up everywhere, smooth as a jade mirror. Those who saw and heard of this marveled at this unprecedented occurrence. During the Zhide era, when Prime Minister Wang went out to govern Yue, he heard that monks were neglecting the Dharma and violating many teaching standards. He requested the Master to serve as Monastic Controller. The Master strictly disciplined them, implementing vinaya regulations with tireless guidance and support. In less than ten days, this became an accepted practice. On the seventeenth day of the eleventh month of the sixth year of Dali, he summoned his disciples, finished entrusting final matters to them, and passed away peacefully. The following year on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, his disciples honored his complete body with a stupa on the south side of Mount Qinwang. Those attending the funeral numbered in the thousands; their wailing moved the mountains, banners and flowers covered the fields. He lived eighty years with sixty-one years as a monk. He ordained over 100,000 disciples. Those who inherited his Dharma and resided separately in various temples included Miaxi

Changzhao, Jianfa Qingyuan, Longxing Shenwan, Yinjing Dao'ang, Longxing Yibin, Kaiyuan Bianxiu, Qixia Zhaoliang, Longxing Fajun and several others. Qingliang Chengguan and Jingxi Zhanran also entered his chambers to receive vinaya. The Master lectured on the *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya* thirty-five times and held more than twenty sessions on the *Revised Handbook*. He once composed *Record of Correct Manifestation in Ten Volumes* to explain the *Practice Manual*. This was one of sixty schools. In the eleventh year of Dali, Duke Xu of Guiji erected a stele praising his virtue.

The eulogy says: Master Manyi proclaimed the Sammatīya Vinaya at Chongfu Temple. None of those who emerged from under his influence failed to excel brilliantly. Among them Master Daliang of Guanyin was the finest. When Liang found a teacher and was called an inner-chamber disciple, he was truly Manyi's legitimate heir. He also transmitted the vinaya of Nanshan. His Dharma assemblies were particularly supreme in the Yangtze-Huai region. Therefore those with aspiration considered that unless they once ascended his platform, they had not obtained the Dharma. The transformative influence of the Master's virtue and conduct penetrated deeply into people. Alas! As a great person of his generation, he was sufficient to spread his fragrant achievements to immortality.

At the end of Kaiyuan he traveled north to the capital and served as Fuxian Great Virtue. He constantly recited the *Nirvana Sutra* and also lectured on it for others. Daily two to three thousand people sat beneath him. His wisdom and eloquence were unobstructed, like gorges collapsing and rivers rushing. Through this his fame stirred the imperial capital. When Lushan's rebellion occurred, he took his staff and returned south. He dwelt between the twin peaks of Hongjing in Western Sichuan, admiring the traces left by the eminent monk Houxian, and established a forest retreat north of the temple. The beauty of mountain springs reached the extremes of profound seclusion. Later it is unknown where he died. He had fully ordained disciples totaling over ten thousand. His writings include *Supplementary Performance of Vinaya Ceremonies in Ten Volumes*. He also once composed *Stele for the Ordination Platform of Longxing Temple*, which became widely celebrated.

**Tang Dynasty Master Jinpyo of Geumsan Temple in Baekje Biography**
Vinaya Master Jinpyo was from the country of Baekje. His clan origins are unclear. For generations his family made hunting their profession. The Master was particularly agile and skilled at archery. During the Kaiyuan years while chasing beasts in the fields, he rested wearily among the field ridges. Seeing many frogs, he thought to himself: "Could these not be made into soup?" He therefore broke willow branches and strung about thirty of them, placing them in deep water. Again chasing beasts, he returned by another path and forgot to retrieve the strung frogs. The following spring, still hunting in that place, he heard frog sounds and went to the water to look. Those he had strung were all gasping but still alive. The Master reproached himself saying: "For my appetite I have caused them to suffer for a full year. Can this sin be forgiven?" He then broke the willow branches and released them. Immediately he drew his sword, cut his hair, and fled into the deep mountains. Practicing intense repentance, prostrating his body to the ground in vows, he faced Maitreya Bodhisattva, seeking to receive bhikṣu precepts. Circumambulating and prostrating continuously, his mind never resting, he doubled his efforts at night beyond his daytime practice. After seven days and nights of this, he saw Bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha

shake a golden staff in his hand, encouraging him and teaching him to develop the conditions for precepts, creating the preliminary practices for receiving them. Joy spread throughout his body and his courage increased further. When the second seven days were complete, suddenly a great demon appeared with a terrifying form and cast the Master down below a cliff, yet his body was not damaged by even a hair. Crawling back up onto the stone platform, the demonic manifestations still had not ceased, but the Master paid them no heed. On the twenty-first day, at daybreak he heard bird sounds saying "The Bodhisattva comes!" Soon the mountains and rivers became level and smooth without heights or depths, forming a silver-colored world. White clouds hung in layers as if soaked in powder. Fragrant breezes and flower-rain were beyond what any worldly scenery could compare with. The Lord of Tuṣita Heaven appeared with majestic bearing, surrounded by various attendants around the stone platform. At that time Maitreya slowly approached the platform site, placed his hand on the Master's head and said: "Excellent, great man! Seeking precepts thus, even Mount Sumeru could be pushed aside, but your mind must not retreat or fall." After praising and stroking him repeatedly, he then conferred the precepts. The Master's body and mind became harmonious and joyful, like the bliss of the third dhyāna. Soon he obtained the divine eye, seeing clearly without obstruction. Maitreya personally bestowed the three Dharma robes and a clay bowl, and granted him the name Jinpyo. Suddenly from beneath his knees emerged two divination sticks - one inscribed "Nine" and the other inscribed "Eight," each with two characters. Looking at these sticks, they were neither ivory nor jade, yet he never learned what material they were made from. Giving them to the Master, he said: "In future when people come to you seeking precepts, you should first have them repent their sins. Sins and merit arise from keeping or violating [precepts]. The method of repenting sins may take ninety days, or forty days, or twenty-one days as one period. When the period is complete and you wish to know the signs of whether sins are extinguished or not, then make 108 additional sticks, inscribe on them the names of the 108 afflictions, use the previous two sticks to match with them, and cast them toward the sky. If the 108 sticks scatter flying

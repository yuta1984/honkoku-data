**Praise says:** The patriarch Zhiyuan (Master Yuanzhao) once composed a "Record of [Master Zhanshuwan's] Conduct and Achievements" for the Master. In his evaluation he says: "To abandon the secular and become the Way has three essentials: first, cultivating oneself (xingji); second, benefiting others (lita); third, protecting the Dharma (hufa). I privately consider that the Monastic Administrator, from entering the Way to his end, received the vinaya and honored the precepts without compromising his principles or disgracing his person. In ritual chanting and incense cultivation he never passed a day in vain—thus his self-cultivation was never lacking in diligence. He constantly worried that vinaya learning in his native region was not flourishing, so he traveled far across rivers and mountains to seek teachers and receive instruction. Morning and evening he lectured and taught, instructing and guiding those who came in ignorance. Thus he made the Nanshan school known far and wide, with its transmission flowing endlessly. It began with the Master—thus his benefit to others was never lacking in breadth. For over forty years he propagated the vinaya canon, spreading it north and south with single-minded commitment to its circulation. He led the teaching community, purified the monastic assembly, presided over ordination platforms, corrected ritual procedures, bore the Dharma while regarding life lightly, and continued until death. Thus his protection of the Dharma was never lacking in devotion. In his later years he retired from affairs, withdrew to cultivate in quiet dwelling, established his will and preserved sincerity, focusing exclusively on westward departure. At the moment of death his mindfulness was correct, and peacefully his spirit departed. Even to his cremation, clergy and laity rushed to attend; the multitude witnessed extraordinary signs and mourned with wailing. This can be called 'perfect from beginning to end, with all virtue and goodness complete.' Without preserving sincerity and bearing the Dharma, who could reach such a level?" Reading this, I increasingly know the Master's worthiness.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Bensong, Song**
The vinaya master was named Bensong. It is not known where he was from. His surname is also not detailed. He was proficient in the Nanshan vinaya and also attained the essential meaning of the direct pointing from the West [Chan Buddhism]. When the lay practitioner Yang Jie requested and asked about the nature and essence of vinaya that Great Master Chengzhao lectured on, the Master answered with a verse saying: "When were emotion and wisdom ever different? Dogs bark but snakes move on their own.

The true meaning of Zhongnan [Nanshan]: beating the third watch at noon."

**Praise says:** What the vinaya takes as its principle is perfect completeness and vastness. If one abandons even small good deeds, it cannot be called fulfilling the precept of gathering good dharmas—how much more the meaning of Kāśyapa's subtle smile! One like Master Song practices Chan and vinaya together without contradiction. His attainment in the school runs deep. Though we do not know the details of his whole story, fortunately this one verse remains. We can only be ashamed that we cannot bite through and break it open.

**Biography of Great Wisdom Vinaya Master of Lingzhi Chongfu Temple, Song**
The vinaya master's personal name was Yuanzhao, courtesy name Zhanran, with the alternate title "Anren zi" (Child of Peaceful Forbearance). He succeeded Vinaya Master Zeqi and was a fifteenth-generation descendant of Nanshan [Daoxuan]. His lay surname was Tang. His father's name was You, whose family had served as government clerks for generations. His mother was of the Zhu family. Both had virtuous conduct and devout faith in Buddhist principles. They gave birth to four sons; the Master was the third. He was born in the eighth year of Qingli, year wuzi. His bone structure showed exceptional character, and his intelligence surpassed his peers. In early childhood he left home under Vinaya Master Huijian of Xiangfu Dongzang. When taught the *Lotus Sutra*, he could immediately memorize it. At age eighteen he was tested on what he had learned and received ordination. While still among the śrāmaṇeras, he was already opening lectures for the assembly. Subsequently he received full ordination and focused his sharp determination exclusively on vinaya study. [He was like] ice cold and indigo blue—those with discernment took special notice. He constantly regretted not having a clear teacher. At that time Dharma Master Shenwu Qian was proclaiming the Tiantai Way at Baoge [Temple]. The Master joined with Zeying to visit him. Qian was delighted upon first sight, his eyebrows moved with joy, and he greatly esteemed him. The Master also rejoiced, saying: "This is truly my teacher!" He requested to remain under his instruction. Through wind, rain, cold and heat, he traveled several li daily. Every time Qian ascended the lecture seat, he would wait for the Master to arrive. If he was a little late, the assembly would request [to begin] because the time had passed. Qian would say: "The listener has not yet arrived"—such was his affection. The Master wanted to abandon what he was studying and follow him exclusively. Qian said: "In recent times the vinaya way has become weak with no one to revive it. Why not illuminate the *Lotus*

in order to propagate the Four-Part [Vinaya]? In the future you will be a master craftsman of the world—I have hopes for you, my child." The Master respectfully received these words and redoubled his efforts. Though heat might melt metal and cold might crack glue, he had no leisure to look back. He extensively investigated all schools while taking vinaya as his foundation. This was not mere words but actual practice. In the first year of Yuanfeng, he received the great bodhisattva precepts from Master Cai of Guangci at Leifeng. During the karma ritual, auspicious light manifested, and all the lamps and torches in the hall were outshone by it. Ten thousand people marveled and sighed, considering it an auspicious sign of receiving the precepts. He was fully equipped with both gradual and sudden vinaya practices. Thereupon he emerged into the world to expound the Dharma, and the Nanshan school blazed forth in great revival. Scholars from all directions heard of his reputation and came to follow him. Famous literati of the time like Hanlin Academician Su Shi and Regional Judge Privy Councilor Jiang all revered him. One day the Privy Councilor entered the temple and requested him to ascend the teaching seat. In the space of unrolling the whisk, the sound of Dharma flowed vastly, uplifting the hearing of humans, devas, dragons, and spirits without exception. After the lecture, the Privy Councilor presented a verse of gratitude, including the lines: "Dragon-elephants circle around the Dharma teaching, scaled and feathered creatures flee from life-release." In the eighth year, Prince-Monk Superintendent Ūichŏn of Koryŏ crossed the sea seeking the Dharma. Hearing of the Master's name, he came with Principal Guest Scholar Yang Jie, requesting to meet with the courtesy of a disciple. The Master presented the essentials of vinaya in nearly three thousand words. Ūichŏn was startled and moved away from his seat, bowing with his head to the ground. The Master bestowed upon him the three robes, bowl, and staff, along with a verse saying: "For you I have tailored these Dharma-appropriate robes, and further offer bowl and staff to aid your dignity. Behold what the Song of Original Awakening teaches—this is not mere form-marking or empty ritualism." Ūichŏn was so delighted he could not contain himself. He then requested the Master's written works to take back to his country, where he had them carved and printed for transmission. In the fifth year of Shaosheng, the reconstruction of the Wutai ordination platform in Mingzhou was completed. An elderly man with transcendent spiritual bearing, white eyebrows and beard, dignified like an arhat in a painting, came forward and said: "This disciple has three pearls to offer in congratulation of the platform's completion."

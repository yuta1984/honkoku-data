He requested Siming Louyue to compose a eulogy as a gift. Indeed, Master Lou was the literary patriarch of that time. There was a Master Shō, the abbess of Kaigen Temple's nuns. Seeing that the master's appearance resembled an arhat, she presented him with the eighteen arhat paintings by Chan Master Chanyue. The master was skilled in Siddhaṃ script. When he encountered an Indian monk showing Sanskrit texts to the assembly, none among the assembly could understand them. The master looked at them and said: "This is language requesting alms bowls." The assembly then offered bowls to him. The Indian monk was greatly delighted, thinking he had met a kindred spirit, and gave him palm leaves and red cloth. After three years he suddenly felt the urge to return home. He went to Chaoguo to bid farewell to Master Yin. Yin gave him dharma words together with teachings on the Pure Land of Mind Only, embedding the meaning of transmitted succession and entrustment. Masters like Zhiyin of Chongfu, Daoyuan of Kaigen, Daochang of Jingfu, Tanxiu of Kuaiji, and Fajiu of Shigu all admired the master and each composed poems and verses to bid him farewell. Master Zhirui's admiration was especially intense. He specially had an artist paint the master's portrait, with a eulogy saying: "I bow to the great teacher of gods and humans, whose home lies in Dazaifu in the eastern sea. The autumn moon serves as his heart and liver, the snow-covered peaks form his eyebrows. Coming, he steered a compassionate vessel ten thousand li; returning, he brings down dharma rain on seventy provinces. What manner of person is this, what manner of person? The first patriarch of vinaya transmission in Japan." Such was his reverence. Subsequently returning to Mingzhou to prepare for the return voyage, they encountered a hurricane at sea creating havoc. The ship was about to capsize. All the sailors lost their composure. The master sat upright without moving and made a vow saying: "My travels in foreign lands are not for fame or profit. I only wish to kindle the dharma lamp to guide the multitude of the ignorant. I pray the dragon kings and devas grant their protection." Upon finishing these words, a great star appeared above the mast, large as a cart wheel, with brilliant radiant light. After a long while it disappeared. The wind and waves soon subsided. Everyone marveled at this. They finally reached Nagato Province's Amutake District. This was the first year of Kenryaku (1211). He obtained Buddha

relics (three pieces), vinaya school scriptures (327 volumes), Tiantai commentaries (716 volumes), and Huayan commentaries (175 volumes). As for Confucian texts and miscellaneous collections, there were over two thousand volumes without doubt. Chan Master Eisai, hearing of his dharma transmission and distant return, welcomed and received him into Kyoto, lodging him at Kennin Temple. His consoling visits were most attentive. Throughout the capital, clergy and laypeople carrying incense to pay respects came continuously. In the winter of the second year he moved to Chofuku Temple. In the sixth year of Kenpo, Yamato Governor Nakahara no Nobufusa, admiring the master's virtuous reputation, invited him to head Higashiyama Senyu Temple. This was built by former Minister of the Left Ochitsugu. The temple had been abandoned for a long time. The master planned its restoration and revival. He then composed a memorial and submitted it to the court. Retired Emperor Genryaku gladly approved his petition and granted ten thousand bolts of silk. The master commanded carpenters and earth-workers to engage in construction work. Whether the main hall, mountain gate, sutra repository, patriarch hall, dharma teaching hall, monks' quarters, or even kitchens and latrines - all were completed in sequence. The master then changed the name tablet to "Sennyū" and opened the hall to teach dharma. Monks competed to rely on his seat. All the regulations he implemented were modeled after the Song dynasty. During the Jōō period, there was an imperial edict making Sennyū an imperial prayer temple. There was Dharma Master Jōkei, a leader of the Yogācāra school. He constantly lamented the decline of the vinaya banner and personally brought the *Jijiaoyi* to seek decisions from the master. The master provided guidance point by point, like parting clouds to see the sun. Masters like Tendai Jizhen and others also admired the master's virtue, their reverence and respect being especially profound. Musashi Vice-Marshal Hōjō Yasutoki invited the master to Kamakura, received bodhisattva precepts, and maintained the etiquette of a disciple. At that time, clergy and laypeople seeking precepts came in continuous streams along the roads. Retired Emperor Genryaku received the great bodhisattva precepts by imperial edict at Kaya Palace. From imperial consorts to court nobles, those who partook of the precept fragrance were beyond counting.

Retired Emperor Kenryaku also received bodhisattva precepts from him, saying: "I wish that from now and forever, I may encounter the master life after life." His reverence can thus be known. Great Minister Dōka of the Fujiwara clan was on intimate terms with the master, constantly inviting him to discuss the Way. The master wrote *Treatise on Buddhist Doctrinal Principles*, *Methods of Nembutsu Samadhi*, *Procedures for Seated Meditation* (one volume each), and *Complete Examination of Three Thousand Teachings* (two volumes) to show him. In the spring of the third year of Karoku he showed signs of illness. The minister personally visited to inquire about his health, donating two village estates in Sanuki Province to provide monastic provisions. The master knew he would not recover. He wrote Master Beifeng's dharma words and the *Pure Land of Mind Only* teaching, adding a complete Lotus Sutra, and sent them as a farewell to the minister. On the seventh day of the intercalary third month, he gathered the assembly, rose himself, burned incense and showed them, saying: "I now briefly explain the dharma essentials for you all: Commit no evil, practice all good, purify your own mind - this is the teaching of all buddhas." After a long pause he said: "Dharma-realm in one thought - call this emptiness; one thought of dharma-realm - call this provisional existence; the fusion and transcendence of thought and realm - call this the middle way. Transcending thought and being perfectly clear, one surpasses the Buddha-ground." The great assembly was both moved and saddened, shedding tears in grateful prostration. On the night of the eighth he wrote a verse: "Throughout life studying extensively - sutras, vinaya, treatises, and teachings; all at once cast aside - serenely without storehouse." After finishing writing, he joined his palms, faced the Amida image, and passed away lying on his right side. The master was born in the first year of Nin'an, year of the fire-dog (1166), and at his passing enjoyed a life span of sixty-two years. His monastic age was forty-three years. His disciples enshrined his complete body in the southern mountain of the temple. The four assemblies attending the funeral all lamented sorrowfully: "The dharma lamp of our school is extinguished." The master's natural disposition was serene and indifferent, not engaging in ostentation. Whenever he received monetary offerings, he immediately used them to build temples and aid the poor. Propagating dharma and maintaining precepts was his constant preoccupation day and night. He was also well-versed in secular learning and skilled in calligraphy. When in Song China, Emperor Ningzong ordered him by edict to write the Cintāmaṇicakra mantra. Duke Zhou of Xiuzhou, Minister Qian, and others all treasured his calligraphy. As for those who

sought stele inscriptions, epitaphs, records, and eulogies, they came daily in continuous succession. Those who entered his gate to receive the Way included Shisen, Shinkai, Shinshin, Jōsen, Shikei, Raison, Sonryū, Shinen, Jōjun, Chikyō, Shin'in, and others - several dozen people. During the Ōei period, Emperor Go-Komatsu bestowed the title "Great Flourishing True Dharma National Master." The imperial edict stated briefly: "I have heard that Shunjō, the founding master of Sennyū Temple, transmitted vinaya and pure conduct, and propagated prātimokṣa dignified deportment. Therefore three generations of sage rulers received the teaching gate of perfect and sudden enlightenment, and people throughout the realm obtained the direct path to buddhahood. Are these not the lamp and torch of the long night, the boat and ship of the sea of suffering? Therefore I posthumously name him Great Flourishing True Dharma National Master." His glory reached this height. Now his image remains solemnly present, and his lineage flourishes greatly. Therefore people throughout the realm, even village children and market youths, all know the name of Sennyū.

The eulogy states: When great sages and worthies arise, they must make great contributions to the world - this is not coincidental. Before the Shōhō period in this country, the vinaya school had not been transmitted. Its transmission began with Great Master Jianzhen. After several hundred years, the ancestral court grew daily darker, and wild wisdom increasingly corrupted the teachings. National Master of True Dharma arose prominently in his time, mastering all schools comprehensively while taking vinaya as the foundation. Moreover, his dharma eye was perfectly clear, his faculties and eloquence keen and swift. His lofty character and stern integrity were like a solitary peak amid snow. His patient endurance and vigorous effort resembled the ceaseless movement of Heaven. Once entering China, he received the orthodox transmission of Master Ruan, returned and raised up Sennyū, sprinkled sweet dew on what was about to wither, and raised the light of precepts from what had grown dim. Alas, the National Master can truly be said to have achieved the merit of restoration for the vinaya gate. Were he not a sage born in the interval between ages, how could he have reached such heights? I once lodged at Higashiyama for six or seven winters, observing its towers and halls streaming with brilliance, bells and chanting continuing their resonance, descendants emerging in succession with princes and nobles paying homage - truly the National Master's lasting achievement, enduring with heaven and earth.

In the 2nd year of Kōan (1279), Retired Emperor Hōji issued an edict for the master to confer bodhisattva precepts. From empresses and consorts to high court nobles, those who received the precepts together were countless in number. Retired Emperor Bun'ō also deeply revered his virtue and requested him to become a bodhisattva precept master. The imperial favor was particularly generous. By imperial edict he lectured on the Brahmajāla Sūtra in the imperial palace, having court officials gather in a circle to listen. None failed to be delighted and enlightened. The master presented the three robes, and the retired emperor bestowed the Tripiṭaka in return. In the 3rd year, he happened to visit the shrine of Amaterasu Ōmikami at Ise, where he enshrined the Tripiṭaka and held a dharma assembly. Suddenly the deity of Mount Mu descended upon a woman and said: "I am a messenger of Amaterasu Ōmikami. The Great Deity says: 'The moon of dharma-nature and true suchness shines bright in the empty space of tranquil light, and the clouds of signless nirvana rest peacefully on the mountain of the four virtues. However, with intense great compassion, I harmonize my light and mingle with the dust to guide sentient beings. Only the aspirations of sentient beings are shallow and inferior, not matching my intentions. Now this venerable one exercises a vast mind, praying that both the imperial dynasty and the Buddha dharma will endure long, causing me to taste the dharma flavor. My joy knows no bounds.'" The master then conferred the great bodhisattva precepts upon the Great Deity. In the 4th year, spring, 1st month, the master copied the Suvarṇaprabhāsa Sūtra with his disciples for the nation's benefit. The retired emperor praised this and personally took up brush and ink to write the chapter on protecting the nation. In summer, 4th month, he established boundaries at Hirata Saifukuji. Soon after returning west, the retired emperor personally visited the temple and bestowed a Ninnō maṇḍala. In autumn, 7th month, Mongol warships reached Dazaifu. Emperor Go-Uda, fearing invasion of the realm, assembled all court officials to discuss the matter. All said: "Without the power of the Buddha dharma, they certainly cannot be subdued." Thereupon the emperor issued an edict to the master. The master received the edict and went to Kyōkōji, gathering the assembly to establish a Ninnō assembly. He also lectured on the Thousand-Armed, Thousand-Eyed Sūtra. When he reached the passage "At the divine and wondrous verses, foreign enemies will immediately submit themselves and each return to governing their own lands," and the master read this three times, the image of the Thousand-Armed Great Being emitted great radiance. The Four Great

Heavenly Kings moved as if they were living beings. The entire assembly of clergy and laity was astonished and filled with wonder. He also led over eight hundred bhikṣus to the Hachiman Shrine at Otokoyama in Yamashiro Province, setting a seven-day period to hold a Ninnō assembly and also perform the Aizen Myōō ritual. On the day the period was fulfilled, the mountains shook, and the shrine doors opened by themselves in the shape of the character "eight." A voice from within the shrine said: "The venerable one diligently practices the great dharma to subdue foreign invaders. I shall provide divine assistance." Just as these words ended, an arrow emerged from within the shrine, emitting light as it flew westward. Its sound was like thunder. Soon three white banners also emerged from the shrine. One bore the five characters of the Lotus Sūtra, one bore the five characters of the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, and one bore the five characters of the Thirty Verses on Consciousness-Only. Each character emitted golden light and also pointed west as they departed. Suddenly fierce winds arose, lightning crashed and thunder rushed, and great rains poured like rivers. Thereupon the clergy and laity in the assembly competed in exclaiming over this unprecedented event. At this time, waves in the western sea rose over twenty fathoms high, and tens of thousands of warships were swallowed up all at once. The Great Deity of Usa gave an oracle saying: "The venerable Shien of Saidaiji, wishing to ward off disaster for the nation, held a dharma assembly at Otokoyama. Because of this, all the deities of the sixty-six provinces have come to Dazaifu. Tonight at the hour of the rat is precisely when the warships will be destroyed." Such was the master's spiritual power. This not only manifested the miraculous traces of the Buddhist gate but truly demonstrated the righteous way of the nation. When close retainers reported this matter to the throne, the emperor was greatly pleased. He kept the master in the palace for seven days, with cordial consolation and abundant rewards. Consequently he received the great bodhisattva precepts and conducted himself with the courtesy of a disciple. Through this, there were no great ministers or high officials who did not devote their sincerity in reverent admiration. The master also received imperial orders to celebrate and praise the Tripiṭaka at Iwashimizu. The emperor led his court ministers in imperial visit. In the 6th year, the newly built Hōshō Gokokuin was completed. It was dedicated exclusively to prayers for imperial prosperity and repaying imperial benevolence. In the 2nd month he performed comprehensive abhiṣeka. In summer, 4th month of the 7th year, the emperor,

considering that the master's age had exceeded eighty years, issued an edict permitting him to ride in a palanquin when entering the imperial palace to discuss essential dharma and receive the three robes. Such reverence could be called supreme. Retired Emperor Bun'ō again invited the master to receive the eight-precept fast vows. When he returned, an envoy was sent to bestow three robes for Venerable Ryūkō along with an imperial handwritten letter. In 7th month, Buddha relics from Hōryūji were stolen by thieves. The temple monks grieved continuously, running east and west searching but finding no trace. They came and reported to the master. The master closed his eyes and prayed earnestly, and suddenly the relics appeared before him. In spring of the 8th year he lectured on the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra. Without incident he became head administrator of Tennōji. This was due to imperial command pressing him to reluctantly accept, not the master's own wish. He established boundaries at Kyōdenin to reside there. Previously, the temple's relics had been lost. The entire assembly was worried about this, but when the master ascended the altar and earnestly prayed, they were immediately found. At that time there were auspicious signs of ethereal clouds circling the eaves and white hawks soaring in the sky. The master rejoiced beyond expectation and commanded fifteen hundred monks to hold a relic assembly. One day he visited the Miwa shrine. The shrine keeper came out to greet him, bowing his head and saying: "Previously the deity gave an oracle saying: 'There is a Śākyamuni in the flesh who will come to my place. You should welcome and receive him.' Now we have indeed encountered the master's arrival. We know the master is an emanation of Śākyamuni Buddha and that the divine words were not false." Consequently they donated the shrine temple to the master, making it permanently a place for propagating the vinaya. The master then established a great boundary and renamed it Ōmiwa. He resided there for one summer retreat, holding Lotus and Suvarṇaprabhāsa assemblies for the deity to protect and bless the realm. Once the monks of Byōdōin at Uji requested the master to lecture on the Brahmajāla. The listeners were like clouds. Fishermen changed their occupation because of this. The master took all their boats and nets and buried them at the bottom of the water, building a thirteen-story stone pagoda above them. He then taught the fishermen to make their livelihood by bleaching cloth. He also built a new long bridge and repaired the bridge temple. A dragon deity emerged from the river and received the precept dharma from the master. When Emperor Fushimi ascended the throne, imperial favor increased even more.

He frequently issued edicts to the master to inquire about the way and receive precepts. On the 4th day of the 8th month of the 3rd year of Shōō (1290), he showed slight illness. Disciples from various temples, along with government officials and lay devotees who came to inquire after his health, came in an endless stream. The master received them all one by one without showing any sign of weariness. Disciples including Kyōe and Gaku, over twenty people in total, took turns attending him day and night. On the 21st day, Right Minor Controller Mitsuyasu came bearing imperial command to inquire after his health. Retired Emperors Bun'ō and Kenji both sent people with gracious concern. On the 24th day, he cleaned his hair, bathed his body, and put on new clean robes. The next early morning, his six-mindfulness practices and other dharma activities were no different from usual. After the meal he sat in lotus position and entered meditation. At that time purple clouds appeared above the temple. Clergy and laity who saw this hurriedly rushed over. Hearing that the master was about to enter nirvana, they were initially startled and called it extraordinary, pressing their palms together and touching their foreheads while chanting "Namo Shien Buddha." At the hour before noon (1-3 PM) he spoke to the assembly: "Although this old monk was born in a degenerate age, fortunately he was not bound by the chains of fame and profit. He raised the banner of vinaya when it had already fallen and deployed the seven assemblies throughout the realm like pieces on a game board. My work of capability is already completed. I shall depart this evening. All of you should eliminate myriad conditions, diligently cultivate the three studies, and ensure that the school tradition of vinaya does not fall to the ground." When the time came he rinsed and washed, put on his lotus-fiber kaṣāya, formed mudrās and sat upright. He recited secret mantras, and as his voice gradually became faint, he passed away. There was an essence that filled the room like aloeswood incense. This was truly at the hour of the rooster (5-7 PM) on the 25th day of the 8th month of Shōō Kōin year. He had lived through ninety springs and autumns in this world and sat through fifty-four summer retreats. Clergy and laity, men and women, wailed in grief and longing, no different from when the Buddha announced his passing in the Sāla Grove. His body remained for three days, his countenance like life, his beard and hair gradually growing longer. When they carried the coffin to the cremation fire, over a thousand monks and nuns attended, and as for lay believers, there was no place to set foot. At that time music sounded in the sky and heavenly flowers fell in profusion. There were also miraculous flowers like red vegetables with extraordinary fragrance, swirling around the intense flames

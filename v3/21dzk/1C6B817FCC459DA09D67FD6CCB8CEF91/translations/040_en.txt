satisfied his intent. He then built a temple here and named it Lingyun ("Soaring Clouds"). Before long, scholars came flocking like wings. After more than ten years he moved to Tailin Hermitage. Subsequently he returned to Donglin. In the seventh month of the fifteenth year of Zhenyuan, he looked upon his disciples and said, "I am departing." He passed away peacefully. He lived seventy-one years with fifty years of monastic age. His dharma-transmission disciples included Fachan and over ten others. The Master thoroughly investigated all vehicles and additionally explored the hundred schools [of philosophy]. Therefore, Grand Preceptor Duke of Lu Yan Zhenqing, Prime Minister Duke Zhao Jing, Censor-in-Chief Duke Lu Qun, and Vice Minister of Personnel Duke Yang Yuling all associated closely with the Master, forgetting worldly forms. Xu Yaozuo composed a stele inscription to commemorate his virtue.

**Biography of Great Master Dayuan of Zhangxin Temple in Jingzhao**
The Great Master's name was Daocheng. His lay surname was Liang. He was from Jingzhao. His father She served as Secretariat Drafter. The Master was born extraordinarily gifted and would not consume meat or pungent foods. When he grew slightly older he left home with no attachments or longings. There was a meditation monk who delighted in the Master's handsome and bright bearing and bestowed upon him his religious name. The Master's movements and stillness were dignified and mysteriously accorded with the vinaya standards. Everyone praised him. After receiving full ordination he transcended the academy halls and studied the Nanshan Vinaya Commentaries. His observance of the precepts was strict and careful. However, his natural disposition was straightforward and simple; he did not stay in one place constantly. Whether at Feng'en, Zhuangyan, Caotang or other temples, wherever he went he would reside. He especially made protecting life his primary duty. In the second year of Jianzhong, while spending the summer retreat on Mount Yunyang, a tiger suddenly roared and entered through the gate. The Master slowly spoke to it. The tiger wagged its tail, folded back its ears, and departed. Not long after, the Master again moved to Zhangxin Temple in Jingzhao. When someone asked the reason, the Master said: "Should one who has left home remain stagnant in one region? The dharma of the Western Regions divides lodgings three times [per day] to prevent attachment. Later generations changed this - how lamentable!" In the second year of Zhenyuan, Emperor Dezong admired his virtue and personally

came to receive the Great Bodhisattva Precepts. Imperial favor was generous and abundant, and bestowed gifts were numerous. The Master used everything for charitable donations to the two fields [of merit and compassion], not keeping even a mustard seed for himself. In the fifth year the Emperor again personally visited the temple and inquired about dharma methods for cultivating the mind. The Master's memorial response pleased the imperial will, and the dragon countenance was greatly delighted. He was again summoned into the Great Palace to bestow bodhisattva precepts upon imperial consorts and palace ladies. He was granted the title Great Master Dayuan. He passed away on the eighteenth day of the ninth month of the nineteenth year. The historical records do not give complete details of his age and monastic years.

**Biography of Great Master Nengjue of Longxing Temple in Shuofang**
The Great Master's name was Biancai. He was a son of the Li family of Xiangyang. His mother's surname was [not specified]. When she was pregnant with the Master, she refused meat and fatty foods, eating only once per day. When the Master was born, extraordinary fragrance filled the room. His clan considered this remarkable. At age seven he took refuge with Meditation Master Ji of Mount Xian and became a novice. When taught the inner canon [Buddhist texts], he could memorize them at a glance and understand their essential meaning. Ji saw his keen intelligence and greatly valued him. At sixteen he was ordained and affiliated with Dayun Temple in his home region. He traveled extensively to famous mountains in various prefectures. Subsequently he went to Yuquan Temple in Jingzhou to receive full ordination. At that time Vinaya Master Huaiwei presided over Anguo [Temple] and Vinaya Master Yiban led Baoen [Temple]. The two vinaya banners stood side by side, their brilliant flames illuminating the four directions. The Master went there to receive instruction. Whenever he had doubts or concerns, he would question the two masters, and would not rest until achieving complete understanding. His peers were astounded and humbled by him. In the fourteenth year of Tianbao, Emperor Xuanzong, [noting that] the northern regions practiced horsemanship and archery, delighted in killing, and their fierce temperament made light of warfare and treated military affairs casually, issued an edict for the Master to preside over ordination platforms to ordain people and thereby convey moral instruction. At the beginning of the Zhide era, Emperor Suzong ascended the throne. Prime Minister Du Hongjian memorialized

the court, inviting the Master to head Longxing Temple. An edict appointed him Great Virtue Teaching Master of Shuofang Circuit, hoping that the barbarian lands would roughly come to know the Way of Vinaya. He was further commanded to establish a Lotus Sutra Practice Hall for the nation. Imperial concern was especially thorough. In the third year of Dali there was an edict appointing him Great Virtue of Zhangxin Temple. The Master secretly cultivated Pure Land practice for twenty years, never claiming it for himself. Only with Protector-General Ren was he close. He said to him: "Cai will certainly be born in the Pure Land. The time is set for ten years." Indeed, in the thirteenth year's winter he showed illness. On the eighth day of the twelfth month, he had his disciples report to Master Ren: "The time I previously set has arrived." When Master Ren arrived, the Master said: "I am now departing." He then gave final instructions to his disciples, sat in meditation posture and passed away. The assembly heard celestial music coming from the west and extraordinary fragrance pervading everywhere. He lived fifty-six years in the world. He sat for [several dozen] summers. The following February, his disciples respectfully interred his complete body in the northwest corner of the temple. By imperial edict he was posthumously titled Great Master Nengjue, with dharma robes provided. During the Tianfu era, Court of Judicial Review Evaluator Wang Dan composed a stele inscription commemorating his virtue.

The eulogy says: "Great Master Jue secretly cultivated Pure Land practice for twenty years, never once letting a single word about his cultivation pass his lips. His nurturing was deep and his accumulation thick - he can truly be called diligent. Therefore at the crucial moment between life and death he was freely magnificent in this way. Those shallow men who, having barely accomplished anything, boast of their achievements and chatter noisily - would it not also be difficult for them to complete their practice?"

Great Master Zhihong emerged from the Qian family of Xiaruoxia in Changcheng, Huzhou. His original name was Yan; Zhihong was his courtesy name. In youth he left lay life at Shimen Temple in his home region. His cleverness and wisdom far exceeded others. After having his head shaved and receiving full ordination, he traveled through Maoyuan and studied at the school of Vinaya Master Daoheng. He intensively researched the vinaya sections. At that time Great Masters Tanqing and Xinggong were both in Heng's assembly. They admired the Master's character and together by lamplight engaged in intensive study and refinement. The Master later established a vinaya teaching seat at Shuanglin Temple in Wu Commandery. He felt that the predecessors' explanations of the Nanshan Commentaries had not achieved complete excellence. He therefore compiled the *Record of Searching for the Mysterious* in twenty volumes, completely encompassing the theories of over forty masters from Daci, Lingyi, and others, making it one among sixty schools. The Huayan Commentary Master, National Teacher Qingliang, composed a preface and introduction for it during the Dali period, placing it at the beginning.

The world dared not use his given name but used his courtesy name, showing how they revered him.

[continued from previous] with offerings of food and drink in the deep of night. The monks and laypeople of the Zhejiang region all respectfully submitted to him with sincere reverence. In the first year of Tianbao he passed away while sitting in meditation on Mount Ding. His body was moved to a seat and placed in a stupa. At that time seven śarīra descended from heaven. His disciples stored them in a precious vase and sealed them in the stupa. When people opened it, they could see śarīra growing abundantly on the Master's teeth and falling in profusion. Later people piled bricks to form a pagoda. There was always a white snake coiled around guarding the stupa. No woodcutter or shepherd boy dared to approach.

The eulogy says: Giving food to hungry ghosts in the deep night represents the utmost compassion. Producing śarīra on his teeth shows the transformative influence of precepts, concentration, and wisdom. The white snake guarding the stupa is also extraordinary.

**Tang Dynasty Master Aitong of Kaiye Temple Biography**
The Vinaya Master's name was Aitong. He was from Tianshui and born into the Zhao clan. For generations they had been a family of high officials. In his youth he was outstanding, and gladly consented to become a son of the Buddha's family. After receiving the precepts, he lectured on the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya. Those who came from far and near to study under him were like fish and birds revering the kun-fish and phoenix. In ancient times during the Southern Song dynasty, Tripitaka Master Juesi from Kashmir translated this vinaya and produced one volume of karma procedures. Over the course of years, the original text was lost and scattered. Students searched but could not obtain it. The Master then extracted one volume of karma procedures from within the great vinaya. Those who studied this school competed to transmit and recite it. During the Shenlong era, translation and propagation were greatly valued. The Master, together with Wengang, verified meanings at Yijing's translation center. The Master contributed significantly to the sūtras that Yijing produced. The details of his death are not known. He once composed *Commentary on the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya in Ten Volumes*. Vinaya Master Xuantong of Ximing Temple received the Master's dying instructions and added further polish to it.

**Tang Dynasty Master Quan of Mount Wutai Biography**

**Right Page Lower Section**
Master Quan was from Wutai County. He left the householder's colorful robes to become a monk, and received full ordination upon reaching adulthood. He was proficient in vinaya and kept the bodhisattva practices secret. His demeanor was pure and elegant; people looked upon him and were convinced in their hearts. Outside of instructing disciples, he maintained silence without wavering. When events occurred near or far, there was nothing he did not know beforehand. Those with insight said this Master had attained the supernatural power of knowing others' thoughts. Throughout his life the Master emphasized fundamentals and moderated consumption. His worn robes and single meal were entirely natural to him. His single room was serene without even a hair's worth of possessions. On the day he passed away, auspicious clouds gathered densely and heavenly music resounded. All the monks in the temple heard extraordinary fragrant aromas. The Master gathered the assembly for final instructions, finished his farewells, and passed away in lotus posture. His lifespan is not recorded in detail.

The eulogy says: Master Quan always knew beforehand when events occurred near or far. This was similar to the case of Great Master Chengzhao. Was he not one who could know the thoughts in the minds of sentient beings in the six realms? People said he had attained the supernatural power of knowing others' thoughts. How could this not be so?

**Tang Dynasty Master Daoguang of Huayan Temple in Hangzhou Biography**
The Vinaya Master's name was Daoguang, surname Chu. It is unclear what region he was from. At age seven he left the white robes [of a layperson], and at twenty received full ordination. He studied vinaya from Master An of Guangzhou. He was heroic, outstanding and brilliant; people called him "The Righteousness Tiger of the Southeast." The Master made reciting the Lotus Sūtra his daily practice and never slackened throughout his life. In the autumn of the gengzi year of Shangyuan he showed illness. On the third day of that month at dawn, he concentrated his spirit in contemplation of the physical body. Suddenly he saw Amitābha's holy form appear before his eyes, and wondrous flowers filled the courtyard. On the fourth day early morning, an extraordinary person came requesting the Master to serve as abbot. The Master opened his eyes, snapped his fingers and said: "Just generate the bodhi-mind." On the fifth day mandārava flowers rained down from heaven. At this point he departed peacefully. He lived seventy-nine years in lay life and wore monastic robes for fifty-eight years.

When his coffin was sealed, wind and rain poured heavily and fine trees broke naturally. Soon five-colored joyous energy appeared towering like a canopy, lasting long without dispersing. His disciples Shenlie, Yilü and several others later became known in their time. Master Ran of Zhu Mountain composed a stupa inscription.

The eulogy says: The *Contemplation of Infinite Life Sūtra* discusses nine grades of rebirth. Those of the highest grade of the highest level have compassionate hearts that do not kill, complete all precept practices, and recite Mahāyāna vaipulya sūtras. Now Master Guang not only perfected precept conduct but also daily practiced the Lotus Sūtra. It is fitting that he repeatedly experienced auspicious signs as death approached. His high ascension to lotus grades is certain.

**Tang Dynasty Master Jueyinyi of Kaiyuan Temple in Guiji Biography**
The Vinaya Master's religious name was Tanyi, courtesy name Jueyin. His family surname was Zhang. His father was Chutu Quan and mother was of the Meng clan. The Master was born endowed with refined energy, his intelligence and awakening manifesting early. At merely the age of "dancing elephant" (fifteen), he studied the Five Classics under Master Li Shen. At sixteen, he happened to pass by Yunmen Temple and heard Dharma Master Maoliang lecturing on sūtras and treatises. His wisdom understanding suddenly developed as if he had long been familiar with it. The Dharma Master found this remarkable and told his mother: "This child has the seed-nature of the Śākyas. He should be made to leave worldly life and study the ultimate dharma." The Master heard this with joy and had the aspiration to transcend the dusty world. During the Jinglong era he received imperial grace for ordination. Upon completing a full year, he received full precepts from Vinaya Master Xuanchang of Danyang. He then immediately pursued the *Practice Manual* under Vinaya Master Tansheng of Dangyang. In the fifth year of Kaiyuan he traveled west to Chang'an. At that time Master Daliang of Guanyin was greatly developing his transformative function with flourishing reputation and extensive influence. The Master went to seek instruction from him, their spiritual paths perfectly harmonized, and he consequently inherited his dharma. Soon after he received bodhisattva precepts from the Indian monk Amoghavajra. He also studied treatises such as Consciousness-Only and Abhidharmakośa under Dharma Master Tanzi of Chongsheng. Nothing failed to be resolved as soon as he engaged with it. When he had extra energy he would discuss the *Book of Changes* with Left Imperial Attendant Chu Wuliang and debate the *Records of the Historian* with Imperial Academy Libationer Ma Zhen. Through this, both inner and outer classics and the subtle meanings of their distinctions became clear to him like a blazing rhinoceros horn [lamp]. Those with discernment called him "a lion cub of the vinaya forest." Therefore the renowned scholars of the time

"Please become the founding patriarch of Japan. If so, I will cast my bones upon the white waves without any remaining regrets." Having finished speaking, he peacefully passed away. The great master grieved inconsolably. Again by his own strength he brought Fushō and others and finally reached shore. Fushō exerted all his strength in assistance. Later, receiving imperial decree, he resided at Tōdaiji Temple. His reputation and influence became more prominent daily. In the second year of Tenpyō-hōji, he memorialized: "It would be good to plant fruit trees beside the roads outside the city. Why? When travelers come and go, when hot they can seek shade, when hungry they can eat the fruit. Would this not assist the imperial transformation?" The decree said: "Acceptable." Was his heart of benefiting and saving others not deep indeed?

**Praise says:** I have heard that the Seven Buddhas, Eight Bodhisattvas, and supreme fruition Buddhas become lords of worlds, manifesting as appropriate and playing in life and death. Emperor Shōmu was born knowing the wonder of the Way, and thought that vinaya was the foundation of bodhi and the dharma for assisting the nation and saving the world. He decreed to Eiei and Fushō to invite Great Master [Jianzhen] to come east and spread the teaching, making all people under heaven ascend to the realm of supreme good. If not persons in the position of Buddha-dharma, who could participate in this? Alas, Emperor Shōmu need not be spoken of. Those two masters Eiei and Fushō spiritually received the imperial decree and went directly to China, not fearing the difficulties of eating ice and chewing bitter herbs, and transmitted this Way. Their hearts of loyalty to ruler and reverence for dharma can be called ultimate. Yet Master Eiei died midway, unable to achieve prominence and fulfill his aspirations. This is truly lamentable. Nevertheless, observing what he wrote himself, it is certainly sufficient to be immortal.

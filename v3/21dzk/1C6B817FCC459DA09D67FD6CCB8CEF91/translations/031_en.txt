**Tang Dynasty Master Dao'an of Longxing Temple in Kuaiji Biography**
The Vinaya Master's name was Dao'an. He came from the great Tang clan of Yingchuan. He was an outstanding disciple of Master Wengang. In youth he had extraordinary spirit and the demeanor of mature wisdom. He devoted attention to classical texts, his wisdom and understanding were incomparable. Still fearing his learning and experience were not yet broad, he soared through the regions between the Yangzi-Huai rivers and Zhu-Si rivers, debating with hundreds of schools and investigating the three teachings. Suddenly he sighed with deep feeling: "Learning from antiquity to enter government service, wearing gold and purple insignia - this is Confucian teaching. Eating pine needles and cypress seeds, riding cranes and mounting dragons - this is Daoist teaching. Both are worldly dharmas that do not transcend the cycle of saṃsāra. How could they compare to the subtle principles of the Three Vehicles, the vast merit of the Six Perfections, weighing the world as a tiny particle and grasping sand realms in one's palm?"

The Master ascended the fearless seat and proclaimed the prātimokṣa vinaya. His words flowed down like a river, his eloquence poured forth like the sea. All listeners at that time gained joy in their hearts. In the jiyou year of Jinglong era, Emperor Xiaohe summoned the Master to the imperial palace. The Master firmly declined, but after messengers went back and forth repeatedly, he finally agreed. He dwelt in the inner palace together with several great virtuous masters. When the Emperor arrived, all the other masters avoided their seats, but the Master alone remained serene in spirit and merely performed a long bow. The Emperor esteemed his bearing and honored him as a bodhisattva precept master, bestowing robes and bowls upon him. He also had his portrait painted in Linguang Palace and bestowed an imperial eulogy saying: "The precept jewel is bright and pure, the wisdom stream clear and clean. His body is confined by the five [precept] sections, his mind merges with the eight concentrations. His learning encompasses true scriptures, his contemplation penetrates real nature. He maintains dharma duties and oversees monastic administration. May the vinaya treasury transmit its fragrance, and the elephant teaching thereby become gloriously prosperous." The honor and favor bestowed upon him had no equal at that time. From this time thereafter, he frequently moved to White Horse, Zhongxing, Zhuangyan, Jianfu, Gangji and other temples, all by imperial command, deeply touching people's hearts. Eventually he went to Guangzhou, opened up land and built a great temple. Monks and laypeople naturally turned to his transformative influence. Since students in the Yangzi region mostly adhered to the *Daśabhāṇavāra* without knowing the *Dharmaguptaka*, the Master requested an imperial edict to greatly promote the Nanshan school. That this school flourished in the Yangzi-Huai region was truly due to the Master's efforts. On the tenth day of the eighth month in the dingsi year of Kaiyuan era, he showed slight illness at Longxing Temple and passed away lying on his right side. The people of the entire province mourned as if losing their parents. His disciples carried his remains and buried them in a tomb at a certain place. Black-robed and white-robed mourners numbered as many as ten thousand. He lived sixty-four years with a certain number of summers.

yi of Zhaiming, Huizhou of Yunming, Huaiying of Hongyi, Huaiyan of Xiangyan, Daogang of Pingyuan, Ziyu of Dayun, Huicuan of Xingguo - all phoenixes of the dharma gate.

In guiding monks and laypeople, his demeanor was warm like spring sunshine, not discriminating between wise and foolish, treating noble and base equally. Vice Minister of Rites Yao Yi composed a stele inscription to commemorate his virtue.

The eulogy says: The Way of the Great Hero - only imperial rulers can foster its flourishing, and patriarchal masters can transmit it. Master An encountered Emperor Xiaohe's sincere reverence for the Way, personally received glorious favor, and stood tall in solely bearing the weight of this Way. He especially received imperial edicts to make the Nanshan school flourish throughout the Yangzi-Huai region. Was this not due to inner and outer protectors mutually supporting each other to accomplish this excellence?

**Biography of Vinaya Master Yixuan of Xingning Temple in Changzhou**
The Vinaya Master's name was Yixuan, a person of Jinling. The biography does not record his surname. His disposition was intelligent and keen, refined and transcending the mundane. After completing ordination, he applied himself diligently to vinaya studies. The benefits of his disciplined practice never ceased, not even for an instant. He thoroughly investigated the inner canon and was also versed in Confucian writings and various texts of Laozi. In the early Tianbao period, hearing that Vinaya Master Fashen of Yangzhou was spreading teachings in the Huaidian region, he immediately went to follow him. Shen exclaimed admiringly: "The younger generation is to be feared - this must refer to someone like you!" Through this, none among his peers failed to respect and value him. After a long time he took leave of Shen and requested to study at Master Zhou's school. His examination and verification were especially precise. He regularly lectured on the *Shichao* and wrote the *Folding Record* in six volumes to explain it. "Folding" means to refute the errors of masters Rongji, Ling'e, and Tansheng, while hitting upon our correct understanding. The Master later resided at Xingning Temple in Changzhou, vigorously promoting teaching and transformation. At that time, those who promoted the Way in Jinling - like Master Huixuan, like Master Dexuan - all had great reputations along with our Master. People called them the "Three Xuans of Jinling." The details of his death are unclear. The Master was also one of the Sixty Schools.

The Master was abundantly talented and richly learned. At age nineteen he responded to the presented scholar examination. Due to the hardship of his father's death, he joined a forest monastery in Nanyang and became a monk. After a long time he studied meditation methods under Meditation Master Zhen at Yuquan Mountain in Jingzhou. Eventually he rested at Dayun Temple. The assembly, because he had originally mastered vinaya, promoted him as sectarian leader. His reputation and influence flourished brilliantly, with nothing to compare. Later he visited Meditation Master Guanjing and suddenly clarified the essential points of mind. In the first year of Dali, intending to visit Mount Qingliang, before reaching Luling he had a chance encounter with Duke Yan Lu. With one word they found affinity, [becoming close] like glue and lacquer. The following year the Governor of Yichun, hearing of his reputation for the Way, sent urgent invitations to extend [an invitation to] him. In the fourth year, Hongzhou Regional Inspector Li Hua welcomed him to stay at Daming Temple. On a certain day in March of that year, he suddenly requested a bath, changed clothes, faced the sky with palms together and departed [from his body]. He lived fifty-nine years. After the pagoda was moved, disciple Yuanyue erected a stele at the Great Spring Pool in front of the temple.

was detailed and clear, with students coming from all directions. In the second year of Zhide he received orders to take charge of Cihe Temple. During the Shangyuan period, Regional Inspector Wei Huan, admiring the Master's virtue, requested him to become the Head Great Virtuous One of Zhaoyin Temple. Thereupon his reputation was loudly proclaimed in all four directions. Contemporary nobles - Runzhou Regional Inspector Han Ben, Huzhou Regional Inspector Wei Sun, and others - all looked up to his influence and paid respect. Whatever donations and benefits the Master received, regardless of abundance or scarcity, he completely redistributed to the two fields of compassion and faith. In the winter of the twelfth year of Dali, he passed away sitting in meditation posture. He lived fifty-four years with thirty-five years of ordination. Both lay and monastic followers mourned and wept around his shrine. The following spring they built a pagoda on the western plain of the mountain. One thousand people gathered for the funeral. The Master lectured on the *Vinaya Commentary* twenty-eight times and ascended ordination platforms twenty-six times. The disciples he ordained included Qinghao, Zeyan, and others totaling a certain number. He had *Ancient and Modern Decisions on the Shichao* in ten volumes.

he depended on Vinaya Master Tanyi of Kuaiji, inquiring into the principles of maintaining and violating [precepts], opening and restraining. During the Zhide period, Emperor Suzong issued an edict summoning those of high conduct, and he was assigned to Kaiyuan Temple in Wu Commandery. During the Qianyuan period the Emperor again sent an edict to twenty-five temples throughout the realm, each selecting seven eminent monks to give extended lectures on the Vinaya Pitaka. The Master also answered this call, becoming a sectarian leader of one region. Thinking of Pure Land practice as a boat and bridge across the sea of suffering, he cultivated precisely without slacking. He once said to people: "I specialize in vinaya while being mindful of Buddha, taking the Pure Land as the refuge of peaceful nourishment. Those who do not understand the Zen school sometimes say Buddha-recitation is a provisional, lesser teaching, or say it is conditioned Mahayana. These are the words of a crooked, dishonest mind, not the explanation of thorough, penetrating clarity. Why? Because when words are uttered they are immediately nature, when intentions arise they are all suchness, and there is no single color or fragrance that is not the Middle Way - how much more so my correct mindfulness!" On the fifteenth day of the sixth month in the first year of Jianzhong, he showed illness and passed away. There was a courtyard tree whose flowers and leaves were perfectly fresh, but on that day they suddenly withered. The entire assembly all gave rise to minds of wonder. On the fifth day of the seventh month of that year, they moved his shrine and interred it to the right of the pine gate at Wuqiu West Temple. He enjoyed a worldly lifespan of sixty-seven years and thirty-five summers. He ascended ordination platforms sixteen times. His Dharma-transmitting disciples Daoliang, Daigai, Qinghui and others, a certain number, all circumambulated the fragrant sandalwood trees. Jiaoran of Zhaxi composed a stele to honor his virtue.

The eulogy says: "Vinaya Master Bianxiu had lofty virtue and reputation, standing far apart from the crowd, yet he was earnestly mindful of peaceful nourishment. Savoring his instructional words and phrases, they accord with the ultimate meaning of the One Vehicle, with every word perfectly interfused. Alas! Was he not one who deeply entered the Dharma-gate of Buddha-recitation?"

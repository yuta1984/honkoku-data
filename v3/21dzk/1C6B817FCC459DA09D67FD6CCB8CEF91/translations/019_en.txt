outstanding among the secular. After receiving ordination, he concentrated exclusively on vinaya studies. He was broadly learned with extensive knowledge, and was also skilled at composing literary works. He possessed an imposing spiritual presence. Initially he taught the Dharma at Shengguang Temple, then transferred to Chanding Temple. When facing the assembly he had the Dharma, and in disciplining himself he was extremely strict. Each day he took only one meal, and even when ill he did not deviate from this. With lowered eyes and upturned hands he received according to the Dharma, never allowing sweet or bitter to alter his mind. He deeply cherished merit from offerings—even remnant water and leftover drops were never wasted. If encountering seriously ill patients who left behind one or two spoonfuls, he would store these for many days until a *sheng* measure could be obtained. He would personally oversee the warming and cooking, commanding pure attendants to consume it. When people asked the reason, he said: "Monastic food is difficult to discard. One must not carelessly slight karmic consequences." Listeners were convinced and submitted. Also fearing harm to seed-nature, he always preserved seeds and fruits. Due to few people understanding the Dharma, he suspected matters had not been thoroughly examined. His understanding, measurement, reverence, and protection were all like this. Later he returned to Shengguang Temple where his practice became increasingly rigorous. At times there were those who carelessly forgot to strain water. The Master grieved deeply at this deviation from compassion, and for the sake of the assembly personally took up the straining implements, not refusing the labor. In the final years of Wude he manifested illness, summoned his friend Huiman, finished bidding farewell, and peacefully passed away. Both his worldly lifespan and monastic years cannot be determined. The Master was usually composed and quiet, never lodging in lay dwellings. If he had distant travels he would rest in forests and wilderness. He constantly wore the three robes, personally carried his water bottle and bowl, did not handle secular vessels, did not engage with music, and vowed never to personally visit the Five Sacred Mountains and Six Prefectures.

Praise says: Because the vinaya values insect life, it establishes the two precepts regarding drinking and consumption. Among those who ascend the ordination platform, none fail to engage in this practice. However, it is rare to find one who, while leading ten thousand people, personally undertakes the task of straining water. Previously Master You would personally examine in detail whenever water was to be used. Now Master Bao personally takes up the straining implements without declining the toil. His establishing of intention and placing of consideration truly shares with all Buddhas the same compassion for sentient beings—is this not the ultimate of

benevolence? In the world there are men who falsely study Mahayana who look down upon those who strain water, saying: "This is the petty work of narrow Hinayana. Enlightened persons beyond convention are not concerned with this." What kind of statement is this really? You know that killing large beings is sinful, yet do not know that killing small beings is also sinful? According to the principle that all beings containing consciousness possess Buddha-nature, what distinction between small and large could there be? The *Bodhisattva Precepts Sutra* states: "All living beings must not be intentionally killed." How extremely thoughtless this is! Alas.

**Biography of Vinaya Masters Huicheng and Zhen of Longju Temple, Yizhou, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's taboo name was Zhizhen, Huicheng being his courtesy name. His clan descended from the Xu family of Xuzhou, and he was the younger brother of Dharma Master Xuan. In youth he cast off worldly bonds, his moral integrity outstanding and exceptional. After receiving full ordination, he soared among Shu's vinaya schools, his wisdom and understanding growing daily more profound. When the realm fell into great chaos, the Master knew affairs were impossible to manage, beat the retreat drum and withdrew. He hid in the Southern Mountains, with Zhongnan and Daibai offering mutual solace through their forms and shadows. When the Sui established the True Dharma, he led the assembled monks in Chang'an. Thereupon he greatly opened the vinaya treasury, with monastics and laypeople swarming like bees. The Yizhou Regional Commander, Shu Prince Xiu, revered the Master's firm moral conduct and requested him to head Faju Temple in Shu. When entering the temple, the Prince personally came out to welcome him with full ceremony. He then held a great feast at the temple. The Master took up his chopsticks about to eat and asked those beside him: "Is this place maintained in purity?" They said no. The Master rose resolutely and said: "This is molten copper—how can it be consumed?" Thereupon several thousand people all dispersed at once. Such was his firm resolve. When the Master was among the assembly his bearing was like that of a lion king, causing those who saw him to tremble in their hearts. There was a monk named Daohui who was naturally fierce and dangerous, submitting to no one. One day upon seeing the Master, his pulse immediately sank and his limbs would not move. When people asked the reason he said: "This Master is a king within the Buddha Dharma, stern and upright, not to be violated." With sighs of

submission he departed. Such was the awe he inspired. In his later years he lived in retirement at Longju Temple, not emerging from forest groves for over forty years. Fame and profit did not enter his thoughts, wealth and treasures were not his concerns—he greatly forgot the human world. Duke Han Li Gun admired the Master's precept-virtue and sent letters with earnest invitations. The Master had a reply letter, which briefly said: "I am honored by your messenger's arrival and sincere words. Reading and reviewing repeatedly, reflecting thrice on each phrase—your writing is clear as green water, your reasoning penetrates the finest detail. This poor monk's precept-conduct has many deficiencies, his transformative methods lack proper direction. Dwelling in wild valleys for over forty years, intimate with fish and birds while singing woodsman's songs, practicing dhyana and contemplating *prajñā*—thus I complete my years, content to fill ditches and ravines," and so forth. He thus declined and did not go. People all esteemed his character and conduct highly, and none failed to admire him with delight. On the first day of the tenth month in the first year of Wude, he suddenly passed away while sitting. His worldly lifespan was eighty years, his monastic years a certain number.

Praise says: The *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya* states: "One should not eat, lodge, or cook food together within the boundary. If one eats, it should be properly treated according to Dharma to maintain purity." The sutras also state: "Due to storing overnight and handling, when the assembled monks eat impure food, they later fall into foul garden ponds and suffer torment for five million lifetimes." Master Cheng's words about molten copper—how could they be empty utterances? This can be called understanding the training rules clearly without regard for others' opinions. As for accepting simple fare to fulfill long-held aspirations and relying on forest groves to complete one's natural lifespan, he would not consent to fall behind the elegant style of Master Yuan of Kuanglu.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Zhishou of Hongfu Temple, Jingzhao, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Zhishou, heir of Hebei. His secular connection was the Huangfu clan, descendant of Master Xuanyan of Anding. His mother, of a certain clan, later gave up jewelry and entered the religious path, advancing in full precepts, called Bhikṣuṇī Fashi. The Master bore aspirations that were outstanding and exceptional, his speech and bearing upright and proper. In his youth he sprouted thoughts of leaving the secular world, straightening his body to cast off bonds. He paid respects to Venerable Zhimin of Yunmen Temple in Xiangzhou and became his spiritual son. His early wisdom particularly favored the vinaya. In all his studies there was no confusion or stagnation. His reputation for keen understanding early filled his native region. At age twenty-two he ascended the ordination platform to receive the great precepts. Though he received them from his teacher, not knowing whether he had truly obtained them, he made supplications before an ancient Buddha pagoda requesting clear verification. Exhausting his sincerity without cease, suddenly he received a Buddha's descent and head-touching, his body and mind becoming peaceful. Only then did he know that responsive ordination was real. From this point he shouldered his umbrella seeking instruction—sometimes sutras, sometimes vinaya. His aspiration was profound and lofty, wanting to swallow and absorb them all. Beyond his comprehensive learning, what he particularly excelled in was the *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya*. Hearing that Vinaya Master Daohong of Hebei had a weighty reputation of the time, he went to pay respects. Hong immediately recognized his capacity upon seeing him. Teacher and student formed a harmonious connection, with seven hundred fellow students—truly a gathering of dragons and elephants. The Master's talents were especially outstanding. At barely thirty years of age, he frequently opened vinaya lecture seats. He practiced both provisional and ultimate teachings. His eloquence was unrestrained and bold, like wielding the great sword *Tai'a*—none could match him. Thereupon his reputation and influence

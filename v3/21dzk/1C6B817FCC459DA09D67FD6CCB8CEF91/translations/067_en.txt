His surname and clan name have not been recorded. He was born in the 5th year of Kenkyū (1194). His spirit and bearing were extraordinary, and his nature was spiritually intelligent. At the age of eight, he already displayed a transcendent disposition toward leaving the dusty world. He served Dharma Master Kinzen of Kōfukuji as his teacher and eventually took the tonsure and dyed his robes. During the day he pursued academic studies, and at night he sat in lotus position practicing meditation. He investigated all the various texts including Vijñānavāda and Abhidharmakośa works. In the 2nd year of Kenryaku (1212), Dharma Master Gedatsu Kei, in selecting people to revive vinaya, was like panning for gold in sand. He gathered twenty talented monks at Jōkiin. The master also responded to this call. Although he was the youngest in age, his learning surpassed his peers. Kei marveled at his capacity and immediately exclaimed with admiration: "The one who will become a wisdom lamp illuminating the world in the future must certainly be this young man." At this point everyone took notice of him. At that time, Dharma Master Myōe Ben was based at Kōzanji and his dharma reputation was very weighty. The master went and relied on him. He studied Kegon teachings and mastered their profound meanings. However, he ultimately felt dissatisfied that vinaya had not yet been revived. So he relied on Venerable Chisoku Nyo, making vinaya study his daily task. He did not abandon this even through cold and heat. He became thoroughly versed in all the classical texts of the vinaya school. One day when visiting Hasedera Temple, his route passed through Kamaguchi. A violent wind and rain arose. The master took shelter at a shrine. Suddenly he encountered a monk. Their conversation turned to matters of vinaya. The master said: "According to the teachings of the Divination and Yoga [texts], by taking the self-ordination karma procedure to receive the precepts, each of the seven assemblies can obtain the precepts and perfect their nature." There was Venerable Shien. He happened to be paying respects at the shrine and overheard this from nearby. His joy knew no bounds. They thus engaged in lengthy discussion. The master rejoiced in finding a like-minded companion and they made a pact as close as brothers. From this point his aspiration to revive vinaya became increasingly earnest. In the 1st year of Jōtei (1232), he lectured on the Hyō-muhyō-shō. Venerable [Shien] and others became his audience. The following year the master thought: "I should take self-vow ordination to fulfill my original vow." At that time Venerable [Shien] was at Ikoma studying and polishing his understanding of vinaya. The master then sent a messenger urging his return. The venerable one was greatly pleased and came carrying his staff. The master, together with the venerable one, Enjō, and Yūgon - these three masters, jointly

solemnly decorated the ritual hall and prayed for auspicious signs. On the 1st day of the 9th month, following the Mahāyāna three-cluster universal ordination method, each took self-vows and received the upāsaka precepts. The next day they received the śrāmaṇera precepts. On the third day, Enjō and Yūgon advanced to full ordination. On the fourth day the master and the venerable one progressed to full ordination. At this time the master was forty-three years old. He erected the vinaya banner at Matsuin of Kōfukuji. Clergy and laity, men and women all turned toward this transformation like a great drought hoping for clouds and rainbow, like infants longing for their wet nurses. This indeed proved true to Dharma Master Kei's prediction. At this time, young monks like Shin'gan Hen and Eshin Kū were called "phoenixes of the time" and all gathered under his teaching seat to assist his dharma transformation. On the 28th day of the 10th month in the winter of the 1st year of Rekinin (1238), the venerable one established the boundary at Saidaiji. The master accepted the invitation and performed the karma ceremony. The next day they conducted the Dharmaguptaka poṣadha. The master ascended the seat and explained the precepts. He was moved to tears and could not stop weeping. Later the venerable one asked about the reason. The master said: "When I previously conducted poṣadha and reached the point of proclaiming purity, I privately thought: 'My precept-roots are not pure yet I falsely proclaim such words. I deceive myself and also deceive others.' I never expected that today I would participate in this excellent assembly and conduct poṣadha according to the dharma. Therefore sorrow and joy intermingle and I am unaware of my weeping." During the Ninji years, Emperor Go-Saga heard of the master's dharma transformation and summoned him to the imperial palace to receive the great bodhisattva precepts. From empresses and consorts to court nobles, many received them together. In the spring of the 2nd month of the 2nd year of Kangen (1244), he established Shōdai Ritsuji Temple. Bells and drums were renewed and the mountains and rivers changed their appearance. On the 14th day of the 4th month of summer, he gathered over forty monks and opened a relic assembly. Sanskrit chanting and ceremonial music shook the forests and peaks with their sound. Next they performed the Dharmaguptaka poṣadha. The following day they performed the Brahmajāla poṣadha. After the poṣadha concluded, he led the assembly to gather at Sanjūbō. There was a single ray of golden light that arose from the west of the building. In the light there was a divine being over ten feet tall with magnificent crown and robes. Bhikṣu Kyōen stepped forward and asked: "Who are you?"

[The divine being] said: "I am Śakra, lord of the thirty-three heavens. Master Kakujō has aroused the supreme bodhi-mind and erected the fallen vinaya banner, conducting poṣadha according to the dharma. Therefore the sixteen arhats have sent me to rejoice with merit. Moreover, although the bhikṣu saṅgha is now complete, there are not yet any bhikṣuṇīs. I shall first make you into a nun." Having finished speaking, he disappeared. At that time fragrant vapors arose abundantly and filled the temple. Suddenly Kyōen transformed from male to female. The entire assembly was amazed and exclaimed in wonder. En immediately took leave of the assembly and returned to his hometown. He encouraged a certain sister to become a monk, named Shin'nyo. She received bhikṣuṇī precepts from the master. From then on, the nuns of both Shōbōji and Hokkeji temples all received full ordination from the master and the venerable one. In the autumn of the 3rd year, wanting to use the four-fold karma procedure to give full ordination to his disciples, the venerable one said: "Does not the vinaya state that a nine-summer preceptor gains both precepts and transgressions? We should wait until next year to perform this." The master said: "Human life is difficult to predict. The true dharma is difficult to encounter. If we do not act now, I fear we will lose the precept transmission. If we can enable people to receive precepts, what else should we worry about?" The venerable one admired his words. He then led the disciples to Ieharadera in Izumi and performed the separate ordination ritual. Before long he returned to Shōdaiji and lectured through the Three Great Compilations once. Of the remaining minor works, there were none he did not expound and explain. Scholars from the four directions gathered like clouds and increased like rivers. Even if Jianzhen were present, this would not be diminished. On the 10th day of the 5th month of the 1st year of Kenchō (1249), he felt his health declining. At his final moment he changed into fresh clean robes, put on his saṅghāṭī, placed his head toward the north and faced west, placed his right hand against his cheek, held an incense burner in his left hand, and passed away peacefully as if entering samādhi. This was actually at the hour of the boar on the 19th day of that month. His lay age was fifty-six. His monastic summers were twelve. Clergy and laity mourned as if losing their parents. His disciples erected a stupa on the home mountain. The black-robed and white-robed disciples he ordained were countless. Those who succeeded to his dharma were

Shin'gan Hen, Eshin Kū, Enritsu Gen, Chūdō Shu, Jissō Shō, Kaigaku Un, Honshō E and others. Each spread his transformative influence in different regions. The one who succeeded the master at Shōdaiji was Enritsu Gen. His writings include the seven-volume Hyō-muhyō-shō Bunshū, one volume of Bosatsukai Tsūbetsu Nijushō, and one volume of Bosatsukai Kenshigishshō, which circulate in the world. He was posthumously granted the title Great Compassion Bodhisattva to honor his virtue. Three years after the master's death, Dharma Master Son of Saidaiji had a dream in which the master told him: "I have been reborn by transformation on Mount Potalaka, leading a thousand monks and greatly saving all beings." Those far and near who heard this were all moved to wonder and admiration.

The eulogy states: Those who depend on external factors are constrained by time and circumstances. Those who do not depend on external factors cannot be constrained by time and circumstances. The Great Compassion Bodhisattva emerged pure and undefiled in the autumn when vinaya was declining and fragmentary. Relying on the clear texts of the Divination and Yoga [treatises], he established the universal ordination method, enabling all people on earth to see the countenance of the ancient Way. He can be called an extraordinary person, a hero transcending the world. His merit in bearing the great dharma and guiding sentient beings, compared to the ancient Jianzhen, need not necessarily be considered inferior. Alas! What the Great Compassion established for himself - how could it be constrained by time and circumstances? Master Mencius said: "Heroes and exceptional people will still arise even without a King Wen." This is truly not false.

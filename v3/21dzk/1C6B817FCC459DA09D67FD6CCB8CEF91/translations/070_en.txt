above. After a long time it did not extinguish. When the fire had finished, five-colored relics (śarīra) sparkled brilliantly covering the ground. The disciples used white wax containers to enshrine the sacred bones and built a pagoda several steps northwest of the temple. They named the hall "Dharmakāya Essential Nature" (Hōshin Taishō). Even now, on nights when the wind is clear and the moon is bright, there are sounds of ringing bells from within the pagoda. When the emperor heard of the master's passing, he grieved incessantly and sent Mitsuyasu to offer condolences. The disciples extensively performed Buddhist services to repay the kindness of dharma nourishment. The master's reputation was universally known, serving as imperial teacher to five courts. His disciples who received full ordination through the comprehensive method numbered over 1,300, those who received full ordination through the separate method numbered over 800, those who received śrāmaṇera, śrāmaṇerikā, and śikṣamāṇā precepts numbered over 400, those who received bodhisattva precepts numbered over 96,000, and those who received esoteric abhiṣeka numbered over 70. His chief dharma successors who went out to reside at famous temples included: Gokuraku Ryōkanshō, Hannya Jidōkū, Senpuku Kaijinshū, Keigū Chūkanzen, Kairyū Chōzenson, Gokoku Honshōyu, Daiji Jōkenken, Yakushi Kanshinkai, Daijō Dōzenken, Mimura Renjungen, Kikō Kakushōkai, Kyōkō Nyoenichi, Sairin Nichijōji, and several others. As for government officials, laymen, and male and female believers who received the three refuges and five or eight precepts, they were too numerous to count. He established 10,710 lecture seats and created 1,350 ponds for releasing living beings in various provinces. He carved countless Buddha and bodhisattva images. Among his literary works are the Brahmajāla Historical Traces Collection, Commentary on the Bodhisattva Precept Text, Commentary on the Karma Ritual Text, Commentary on the Responsive Principle School Precept Diagrams, Collection and Commentary on Arousing Bodhicitta, Collection on Mental Formations and Non-Mental Formations Chapters, Collection on Essential Auxiliary Practices, Ritual for Separately Receiving the Eight Precepts, Ritual for Conferring Bodhisattva Precepts, and several other volumes, all of which are

circulated in the world. In the 2nd year of Shōan (1300), Emperor Go-Fushimi issued an edict posthumously naming him "Kōshō Bodhisattva." From the master's birth until his death, his deeds were extremely numerous. They are recorded in detail in the "Record of Response Body" (Kanshin-ki), "Crane Grove Record" (Kakurin-ki), and other works. What is recorded here preserves only about one in a thousand of them.

In praise it is said: Ah, Kōshō Bodhisattva! Was he not truly a sub-sage and great man for his age? He arose particularly in a degenerate time to revive the correct path of vinaya, able to support [the tradition of] Nanshan and compete in brilliance with the sun and moon. For over fifty years he expounded this way like clouds and thunder arising in succession with nine dragons spouting rain, so that roots and stems both small and large all achieved life and growth. Having someone like Kōshō, his achievements were truly beyond what ordinary sentiment could measure. I have secretly considered this: in his youth he yearned for the Buddha like Sēngyòu, rushed to study sutras and treatises and later became keen like Huìguāng, served as imperial teacher and devoted loyalty like Xuánwǎn, preached dharma freely and thoroughly understood expedient and ultimate like Hóngzūn, reached the age of ninety with vigorous spirit like Wéngāng. When it came to establishing temples, carving images, practicing charity, releasing living beings, and extending to memorial services and disaster relief, all the beauties of the world were concentrated in one person. Ah, Kōshō Bodhisattva! He was truly a sub-sage and great man for his age.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Kaie Jō of Kairyūōji in the Southern Capital**
The vinaya master's religious name was Genjō, styled Kaie. His family name is not known in detail. He left the dusty world early and exclusively cultivated esoteric practices. In the 1st year of Antei (1227), when the master was twenty-three years old, he received comprehensive abhiṣeka from Ācārya Shin'e. He resided at Kairyūōji in the Southern Capital and studied exoteric and esoteric teachings. In the 2nd year of Katei (1236), he requested Kōshō Bodhisattva to expound the principles of the vinaya school. [Kōshō] was moved by the master's aspiration and arose to respond. The following year in the 8th month, the master wanted to

receive full ordination from Kōshō, but [Kōshō] declined and would not permit it, considering that the master's age and virtue were already advanced. The master then took self-administered vows, with [Kōshō] serving as witness. He constantly assisted Kōshō in greatly promoting this way, and wandering monks from the four directions who came to study were like a marketplace. In the 1st year of Ryakunin (1238), when Kōshō established boundaries at Saidaiji, he appointed the master to serve in the position of karma-dāna (disciplinarian). During the Ninji era (1240-1243), following Kōshō's command, he went to prisons to provide food to the hungry and also had them bathe and conferred the eight precepts upon them. Such was his benevolence and compassion. In the 3rd year of Kangen (1245), when Kōshō performed the separate ordination method at Kehara-ji in Izumi, conferring full ordination upon his disciples, the master also participated. In the 1st year of Shōō (1288), he established boundaries at Kairyūōji. The details of his end are not known.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Shōkaku Nin of Kairyūōji**
The vinaya master's religious name was Gen'nin, styled Shōkaku. In his youth he left worldly defilement and cast his lot with the dark-robed forest. In the 3rd year of Katei (1237), he met Kōshō Bodhisattva at Kairyūōji and consequently received śrāmaṇera ordination. Soon he went to Jōkiin and received full ordination from Daihi Bodhisattva. At that time he was twenty-six years old. He was broadly versed in the vinaya section and also proficient in esoteric texts. In a certain year he succeeded to the seat of Kairyū[ōji] and became an object of reverence for the four assemblies. In the 2nd year of Kangen (1244) he received additional full ordination. He died on the 10th day of the 12th month of the 1st year of Hōji (1247). His worldly age was thirty-six, having sat through eleven summer retreats.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Shin'gan Ben of Daisyō Chikurinji at Ikoma**
The vinaya master's religious name was Ryōben, titled Shin'gan. Initially he was a leader of the Yogācāra school. With sharp wisdom and heroic talent, his contemporaries could hardly compete with him. He especially gained fame through Buddhist logic (hetuvidyā) and opened dharma [teaching] at Byakugōji. Among the clergy and laity there were none who did not

respect his virtue and follow his transformation. In a certain year he received imperial edict to become Acting Great Monk Supervisor (gon-daisōzu). Through this his reputation spread far. In the 1st year of Jōei (1232), when the master was forty-eight years old, he declined worldly honors and profits and retired to Daisyō Chikurinji at Ikoma. However, the fragrance of his way could not be concealed, and the four assemblies continued to rely on him with admiration. During the Katei era he heard that Daihi Bodhisattva had established the dharma banner at Shōin and immediately went to visit him. Consequently he received full ordination from him, studied the vinaya intensively, and stored it in his heart. If he had any doubts or difficulties, he would consult Vinaya Master Jōshun about them. The scholarly monks of the time, seeing Daihi establish the principle that "comprehensive ordination makes bhikṣu nature and precepts both complete," were half in doubt and half in faith, with arguments erupting. The master wrote many works, citing ancient and contemporary [sources] as evidence. Daihi's influence then greatly flourished, and both internal and external assemblies all gained satisfaction. The master constantly cultivated Pure Land practices without negligence and also taught others with this. He once went to Tōfukuji, visited National Teacher Shōichi to consult on Zen essentials, and presented his work "Essential Decisions of the True Mind." The national teacher praised it and wrote a postscript. The master passed away in the 4th year of Kenchō Mizunoe-ne (1252). His worldly age was sixty-nine, with an unspecified number of monastic summers. His dharma-successor disciples included Mitsugen and several others. Among his written works are: Commentary on the Principles of Comprehensive Ordination, Essential Meaning for Bhikṣus on Prevention, Care, Separate vs. Comprehensive Ordination, and Repentance Methods, Commentary on Mental Formation Chapters, Record of Decisive Mind for Nembutsu Rebirth, Essential Decisions of the True Mind, Commentary on the General Meaning of Dharma Characteristics, and several other volumes. There are also "Commentary on the Two Ordinations" and "Commentary on Dispelling Doubts," which are said to be embellishments of commentaries composed by Daihi.

In praise it is said: When a wandering dragon stirs in rivers and seas, clouds and vapor naturally arise on all sides. When a fierce tiger roars in mountains and forests, swift winds come rushing. Indeed, like kinds naturally respond to each other. When Daihi Bodhisattva established and planted the dharma

Still nothing could be seen. On the night of the third day, he saw over a hundred lanterns appear in the air. Also a red light over a thousand feet long appeared. At this Duke Ji trembled and made obeisance, marveling at this unprecedented occurrence. Soon a golden hand emerged from among the pines, about seven feet long. Two bodhisattvas of yellow-white color flickered so brightly they could not be looked at directly. The next day at noon, one lantern appeared on the cypress in the courtyard, competing with the sun for brilliance. Crystal was spread horizontally, the mountain about three li away. One precious jewel, one zhang in circumference, sparkling lovingly. A great rainbow bridge arose above the western ridge's mountain gate. On the bridge Sanskrit monks, old and young, and boy novices appeared intermittently. Two torches crossed back and forth in the air like welcoming and seeing-off ceremonies. Below them were four bodhisattvas standing in pairs. Their whole bodies emitted multicolored light, sixty to seventy feet in height. Suddenly a temple plaque was posted behind the great pine forest, written in seal script with the characters "Three Learnings." Another lantern blazed brilliantly, hanging down two embroidered ribbons. At night a golden mountain appeared among the eastern forest. When the moon was at its zenith, lanterns of gold and silver colors illuminated the side of Dharma Master Zhixuan's tomb. This was truly a miraculous event. Prince Wei Gao of Nankang held a feast for three hundred bodhisattvas at the temple every March. Palace Secretary Bai Minzhong not only repaired all the buildings but also fully documented these spiritual traces and reported them. In the eighth year of Dazhong an imperial edict changed the temple name to "Kaizhao." Therefore the vinaya studies of Eastern Chuan ultimately acknowledged the Master as sectarian leader.

The eulogy says: "Since ancient times those who lectured on the *Avatamsaka* have had numerous spiritual responses. Recorded in various biographical records, clear as paintings. Now Master Yuan daily fed a thousand monks, yet the granary never ran empty. This was brought about by the awesome spiritual power of the sutra, and also what the Master's sincerity moved. As for the divine anomalies in the mountains startling people's hearts and eyes, were these not what is called 'outstanding people in a spiritual place'?"

**Biography of Vinaya Master Chengru of Anguo Temple**
The Vinaya Master's name was Chengru. It is unknown what place he was from. His surname and courtesy name are also unclear. After receiving ordination and precepts, he comprehensively mastered vinaya studies and was especially skilled at expounding [the teachings]. He constantly made supporting and assisting the vinaya teachings his own responsibility, tempering the sangha with tireless dedication. Through this the four assemblies revered his style, and court and countryside heard his name. During Emperor Daizong's reign, he received imperial orders to participate in translation work, and concurrently served in the role of presiding over ordination platforms on both sides [of the capital]. Previously, when any of the five assemblies died, their robes, funds, and possessions all went into the imperial treasury, and for successive reigns no one was able to reform this. The Master was deeply pained by this and memorialized: "The vinaya contains this: when ordained bhikṣus live they receive benefits as they arise; when they die, the benefits return to the saṅgha. Now if they return to the government, this is exactly the same as confiscation. I request following vinaya law to determine the severity of this matter." In the second year of Dali, the Emperor specially issued a clear edict: "Henceforth the possessions of deceased monks shall accordingly enter [the possession of] the saṅgha. This shall be proclaimed in notifications from the Secretariat." When the whole realm followed this, accumulated abuses were suddenly eliminated. The Master later became head monk of both Ximing and Anguo temples. The details of his death are not recorded. He ordained one thousand disciples. He had a literary collection in three volumes that was transmitted to the world.

The eulogy says: "The vinaya records: There was a bhikṣu who died with many robes and possessions. The royal family relatives wanted to collect them all. The Buddha said: 'Royal relatives should not [take them]; the saṅgha should obtain them.'" Now observing Emperor Daizong, he was able to accept Master Ru's memorial and according to monastic vinaya distribute the possessions of the deceased. This was because it accorded with the Buddha's teaching intention. Even so, if at that time there had not been someone like Master Ru, how could Emperor Daizong's virtue have been achieved? Alas! What Master Ru accomplished had very great merit for the vinaya teachings.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Yuanzhao of Ximing Temple**
The Vinaya Master's name was Yuanzhao. He came from the Zhang family, a person of Lantian in Jingzhao. At age ten he took tonsure under Vinaya Master Jingyun of Ximing. At twenty-five he ascended the Sarvāstivāda platform and received full ordination. He maintained [the precepts] with care and sincerity, as if holding precious vessels. Beyond studying vinaya, he moved skillfully through sutras and treatises. Generally the *Avatamsaka*, *Vimalakīrti*, *Lotus*, *Nirvana*, *Hetuvidyā*, *Vijñānavāda*, *Madhyamaka*, etc., formed a profound treasury. He also sought in Confucian and Mohist [texts] and was accomplished in elegant poetry. His reputation spread in all directions and he was valued by his contemporaries. During the Kaiyuan period, Emperor Daizong ordered the Master to participate in translation work. In the thirteenth year of Dali, the Emperor again summoned fourteen great virtuous ones from ordination platforms on both streets to jointly determine new and old commentaries at Anguo Temple. The Master together with Great Virtuous Ones Tansui and Rujing was selected. The Emperor ordered Palace Attendant Zhao Fengquan to supply paper, ink, brushes, inkstones, and provisions of food, tea, and fruit for their use. By the first year of Jianzhong under Emperor Dezong, the commentary draft was completed. It was titled "Imperially Determined Commentary on the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya." The Master received orders to copy and present it. He also requested that both new and old commentaries be practiced in parallel. An edict granted this. The Master had excellent comprehensive learning and considerable achievement in the vinaya path. Successive dynasties valued his virtue, appointing him as one of the Ten Most Eminent Great Virtuous Ones of Both Streets' Ordination Platforms, Inner Court Attendant, Inspector Chamberlain for Dependencies, with an income of one hundred households. In a certain year he entered nirvana. He lived eighty-two years and sat for fifty-eight summers. His writings include: *Collectively Determined Vinaya Commentary*, *Yixing's Imperial Writings Collection*, *Prajñā Tripiṭaka's Continued Chart of Ancient and Modern Translations*, *Sound and Meaning of the Mahāyāna Adhyāśaya Six Pāramitās Sūtra*, *Basic Record of the Years of Existence and Death of Dharma Kings of the Three Teachings*, *Revised Record of Śākyamuni Buddha Dharma King*, *Record of the Buddha Manifesting the Eight-Phase Body to Benefit Humans and Devas and Achieve Perfect Enlightenment*, *Commentary on Judging Vaipulya Ritual Sites for Those Wishing to Receive

**Biography of Vinaya Master Jiandao Zhi of Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou**
The Vinaya Master's taboo name was Shouzhi, courtesy name Jiandao. He was the son of the Fan family of Qiantang, eighth-generation grandson of Qi Protector of Xin'an, Qiong. From childhood he did not like keeping hair, having a carefree disposition beyond the dusty world. After completing the crown appearance, he received full vinaya precepts from Great Master Yuan of Zhiqing Temple in Su. On the evening of ascending the platform, light appeared in his eyes, over a zhang in length. After a long time it disappeared. Later he depended on Master Zhen at Jiangling, practicing intensively for three winters and summers. He traveled out to visit famous sites throughout the realm to broaden his mind. Soon he received bodhisattva precepts from Tripiṭaka Master Amoghavajra. He also made a vow to recite the *Avatamsaka Sūtra*. One night he dreamed a divine being gave him a pearl. Upon awakening, he was dazed as if the pearl were in his grasp. He then entered Mount Wutai, reading through [scriptures] about two hundred times to fulfill his vow. Moreover he perused the entire Tripiṭaka three times. In the twenty-sixth year of Kaiyuan, high conduct was summoned by edict and he resided at Dalin Temple on Mount Lu. In the second year of Dali he moved to Tianzhu Lingyin Temple. His reputation grew even more. In the third month of the fifth year he lodged at Longxing Pure Land Cloister. One day he said to his attendants: "Persons of supreme virtue come riding on suchness and depart riding on suchness. How could those who wish to tie up the white sun with long ropes be worthy of discussing this?" Finally on the twenty-ninth day of that month he announced his end. He lived seventy-one years with forty-five years of ordination. He ordained a certain number of disciples. His foremost Dharma-transmitting [disciples] were: Jiaoran of Huzhou, Huipu of a certain temple, Qingjiang of Kuaiji, Daozhuang of a certain temple, Zelin of Hangzhou, Shenyan of a certain temple, Chang[...]

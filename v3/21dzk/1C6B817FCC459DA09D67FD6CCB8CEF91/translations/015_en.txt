It says: "Master Yun is the head, Master Hui the tail, Hongli is placed in the middle." Their ends are not detailed.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Tanyin of Dayan Temple, East of Ye, Northern Qi**
The Vinaya Master's name was Tanyin, from the Shi family of Henei. In his tender years he left the dusty world. His spiritual faculties were broad and transcendent, his precept conduct extremely rigorous. He recited and studied various sutras, totaling about 300,000 words. He made this his daily and nightly practice. When his years were complete and he received full ordination, he studied the vinaya sections under Vinaya Master Daofu. He was diligent without a moment's laziness. Eventually he took leave of Fu and went to see Vinaya Master Huiguang at Dajue. Guang immediately felt a karmic connection upon first meeting. His diligent service was uninterrupted, and his attainments became ever deeper. He thus became Guang's great disciple. After a long time he went out to travel through the capital regions and moved to Yan and Zhao. Hou Jing, the prefect of Dingzhou and patron, admired the Master's virtue and revered him like an immortal. He built a monastery for him, but the Master declined the abbotship and returned his staff to the banks of the Zhang River. Grand Secretary Gao Longzhi treated him with special favor, and his coming and going became what the times admired. Hou Jing then extended an invitation to establish Dayan east of Ye. Here he broadly proclaimed the precept school. The five assemblies moved like wind, none failing to bow in reverence. Regarding all the profound principles of vinaya, he resolved questions as they arose without hesitation. At that time there was a vinaya-holding monk called Daole. His reputation for the Way blazed alongside the Master's. A saying in Ye went: "For clear understanding of the vinaya school, there are only Yin and Le." Such was how the world esteemed them. The Master had an extraordinary appearance, walking like an elephant and gazing like a tiger. By nature he valued solitary enjoyment and did not tonsure and keep disciples. His room had no superfluous possessions; in cold and heat he had only one cloth robe. None surpassed the Master in the precision of upholding vinaya. He finally manifested extinction at Dajue Temple in Ye City. He lived in the world sixty-three years. He spent the rains retreat forty-three summers. Those who received his dharma numbered over ten people including so-and-so. He had writings that circulated at the time.

Praise says: Chan Master Si of Nanyue said: "Throughout my life I hoped to enter the copper wheel, but because I led disciples too early, I damaged myself to benefit others, and only realized the iron wheel." Master Yin's valuing of solitary enjoyment and not tonsuring and keeping disciples surely had its reasons. Can we of later generations observe this without feeling shame? Can we not be inspired to effort?

**Biography of Vinaya Master Tanyuan of Guangzhai Temple, Yangdu, Chen Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Tanyuan, a person of Jinling. His clan lineage is not detailed. His innate nature was intelligent and keen, and he thoroughly mastered external classics. He was quite proud of his literary accomplishments. At the time someone remonstrated with him. The Master immediately cast off his former studies and learned the supramundane dharma. After receiving ordination and taking precepts, he studied various vinaya sections. He particularly researched the *Sarvāstivāda Vinaya*, penetrating to its subtleties. Each time he ascended the seat to lecture and chant, the hall was full and seats were occupied. Listeners never tired of receiving instruction. In the third year of Sui Dajian, xinmao year, Emperor Xuan issued an edict throughout the realm: those who had initially received precepts and had not yet completed five years should all attend vinaya studies. In the great temples of the capital, extensive listening halls were established. The emperor then commanded the Master to oversee and supervise everything. He clearly indicated the examination system. At that time, the assembly of monks numbered three thousand. Officials supplied robes and food. The Master selected over twenty learned monks from among the assembly and trained the students. For those whose studies were complete and who were about to return to their home regions, the Master would personally question them through several rounds of back-and-forth. He would verify their understanding before sending them off. His maintenance of regulations was strict and orderly, with complete proper deportment. The five assemblies of the entire nation turned toward him in submission. Vinaya studies reached their peak at this time. The emperor was greatly pleased and promoted him to Monastic Director. He was put in charge of Guangzhai Temple. After residing there briefly, he retired to a quiet chamber. Yet his self-discipline and encouragement of practice were even stricter than in his days of leading the assembly. As for fame, reputation, and material support, he viewed them as if they were nothing. He never participated in congratulatory or condolence ceremonies or feast assemblies. Each time he went to the various temples of Zhongfu, he would wander among famous mountains and waters. He had a poem inscribed on a tree

that said: "Few pine needles in Danyang, many millet sprouts in white waters. Gradually they bring down travelers' tears, sorrowful laments stir folk songs. Spring paths cross short kudzu, autumn pools submerge long sedge grass. Deer leap and lean freely, carriages and horses cease to pass through. Desolate, I indulge in gazing at the wilderness, melancholy—what shall I do?" Dharma Master Hongyan responded with praise. One day he manifested slight illness, gathered the great assembly and admonished them saying: "The time has already arrived. I wish to depart. You people should not be concerned with the world's ups and downs. Supporting and assisting the religious teaching is sufficient." When he finished speaking, he sat upright and departed peacefully. He enjoyed a lifespan of eighty-two years. His wisdom-lifespan was a certain number. When monastics and laypeople heard the death announcement, none failed to be shocked and sigh. When the emperor reviewed the memorial, he was deeply moved with grief and longing. He issued an edict bestowing lavish funeral rites, erected a white pagoda, composed an inscription to honor his virtue. The Master's lifetime compositions include *Commentary on the Sarvāstivāda* in ten volumes, commentaries on the precept text and procedural acts in two volumes each, *Monastic Etiquette* in four volumes, and *Miscellaneous Collection* in eight volumes. They were widely practiced in the world.

Praise says: Master Yuan received imperial command to become the refuge for all under heaven. He greatly spread the school's teachings and disciplined the misconduct of the five assemblies. His moral virtue was outstanding and eminent; people of the time looked up to him like a mountain or the Big Dipper. Yet he did not dwell in positions of honor, taking pleasure in mountain light and water reflections. Can this not be called pure? At the time of leaving the world, it was no different from the ease of a person returning to their hometown. What a true bhikṣu!

**Biography of Vinaya Master Zhiwen of Guangye Temple, Yangdu, Chen Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Zhiwen, surname Tao, a person of Danyang. His father was a certain person. His mother was the daughter of Qi Palace Secretary Tao. She dreamed a Sanskrit monk gave her a pine branch saying: "You will later give birth to a boy. Give this to him as a fly whisk." Upon awakening she immediately conceived. When he was born he was intelligent and keen, surpassing his peers. At the age of aspiring to learning, he paid respects to Master Baotian Cheng and served him as teacher. Eventually he ascended

the ordination platform and received the complete precepts. He thought to himself: "Precepts are the guide and leader of the five vehicles, the boat and bridge of the Three Treasures. By principle one must first be precise in them to accord with the Buddha's intention." He then took up his staff to visit Master Bian at Fengcheng and Master Tuan at Daming, consulting them about the vinayas of various schools. He particularly mastered the *Sarvāstivāda Vinaya*. In the seventh year of Liang Datong, the various assemblies of Lingwei and Waguan temples deliberated and memorialized the court, inviting the Master to head Guangye Temple. From this time, those coming from the four directions with traveling packs streamed continuously. The hall held no fewer than ten thousand people. Even people like wine sellers and fishermen received the Master's transformative influence. Some destroyed their wine vessels, others burned their fishing nets. During the difficulties at the end of Liang, he took refuge in Fujian. The outstanding monastics of the time, Sengzong, Fazhun and others, treated him with great kindness, holding texts to request instruction. When Tripiṭaka Master Paramārtha translated sutras and treatises in Jin'an, the Master also participated in those sessions. At the time of the Huai-Si battles when supply lines were cut, Emperor Xuan commanded monastics everywhere to undertake that service. The Master deeply protected the true dharma, not fearing severe punishment, and submitted a memorial saying: "When a gentleman serves the state, he must do so with ritual propriety and righteousness. Your Majesty truly knows the errors of Yuwen's destruction and abolition. How could it be appropriate to use the supreme field of merit for menial tasks? This would not only invite the enemy's contempt and ridicule, but I fear the state would receive calamity." The emperor was greatly moved to regret and issued an edict permitting this. From then on, whatever he memorialized was always in accord with the imperial will. Minister of Personnel Jiyang Jiang Zong frequently inquired about the Way. Each time he heard the Master's instructive words, none failed to depart with joyful heart and sincere submission. The Master's noble conduct was very numerous. This example suffices to show the rest; I will not record them in detail. He manifested nirvana on the twentieth day of the second month of the nineteenth year of Sui Kaihuang. His worldly lifespan was ninety-one years. His monastic years were a certain number. His disciples honored his whole body and buried it in the eastern ridge of the southern mountain of the temple, facing Vinaya Master Bian's pagoda. The Master's bearing was firm toward things, his demeanor dignified people. His precept quality was perfectly pure, his judgments clear and distinct. Throughout his life he made propagating dharma and guiding the community his personal duty. He lectured on the *Sarvāstivāda*

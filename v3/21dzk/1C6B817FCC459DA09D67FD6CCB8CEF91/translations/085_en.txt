He was not stingy with his possessions. Everyone was moved by his generous heart and made donations to him. Once while performing religious rituals, he felt a divine child appear and teach him secret dharma. Also, one night in a dream, a divine monk told him, "In the future you will surely be born in the Pure Land." The master said, "Can I be born there together with all sentient beings?" The monk replied, "No." The master said, "Then I do not wish it." The monk said, "It is precisely because of such a compassionate mind that you can attain rebirth there."

Once when he was out, a cowherd pushed the master into a muddy swamp. The master showed no anger but merely washed his robes and waited for them to dry. The villagers witnessed this and exclaimed in admiration, "He is a true monk!" They then invited him into their homes and made offerings.

In a certain year, he went to Eifuku Temple on Mount Ishinaga in Kawachi Province and saw that the Buddhist pagoda was in ruins. He restored it. The common people provided assistance like Zi Lai, and it was completed in no time. This was because his virtue in keeping the precepts was sublime, and his achievements came to fruition in this way. In the fourth year of Shōhō (1647), he passed away there. He lived to be sixty-three years old with thirty-six years in the dharma. His disciples carried his remains and buried them at Enzū Temple. His dharma heirs included Shinshō, Nin, and others, and the lay and ordained men and women who received refuge vows from him were countless.

**Biography of Dharma Master Myōkū Shō of Gokuraku Temple in Yamato Province**

The dharma master's posthumous name was Ryōshō, and Myōkū was his courtesy name. He was from Kyoto, born into the Hasike family. From childhood he was intelligent and had a transcendent attitude toward renunciation. His parents found this remarkable and sent him to Sōmyō Temple under Nikkan to have his head shaved. Nikkan taught him books such as the "Four Teachings of the Lotus Sutra" and "Western Valley Categories." After two years, he could immediately memorize everything without forgetting. Later he studied Tiantai teachings at lecture halls in Takagamine, his wisdom advanced daily, and his reputation grew.

In the fifteenth year of Keichō (1610), when the master was nineteen, he resolutely aspired to seek the vinaya. He took his staff and went to Ōharano, where he met Dharma Master Kūin. Kūin appreciated his aspiration and directed him to Mount Makio. The monks heard of the master's arrival and came out to meet him along the way. He then received the breathing compassion precepts from Dharma Master Eun Kaikai. The following year he received full ordination. He was then twenty years old.

He studied vinaya and comprehended its profound subtleties. His wonderful practice of the three collections of precepts was as pure as ice and snow. After completing five summers, he moved to Hokushitsu Vinaya Temple in Yamato. He constantly propagated the dharma in all directions through both exoteric and esoteric teachings, and monks came to him like water flowing into a marsh.

The master considered nembutsu samadhi to be the direct path to buddhahood and devoted himself to Pure Land practice. When Minister Asukawi established the Lotus Nembutsu Assembly, the master assisted with it, and both lay and ordained people competed to participate. The master said, "If you recite the Buddha's name with sincere mind and do not neglect your daily practice, Amida Buddha will record your names in the lotus pond as a place of return." For those with special practices, he wrote names on lotus-shaped paper slips and gave them out. Everyone considered this proof of their future rebirth. From this time on, the commotion of those near and far receiving the master's teachings intensified daily.

The Retired Emperor heard of his virtuous influence and issued an edict for him to enter the imperial court, but the master declined and did not comply. The Emperor respected him even more and bestowed silk upon him. The master could not refuse but immediately donated it to Tōdai Temple. In his later years, he built a hermitage on the old site of Gokuraku Temple, abandoned all other duties, and devoted himself exclusively to Pure Land practice. He recited the Buddha's name thirty thousand times daily and never missed daily prostrations and sutra recitation. Throughout his life he wore poor clothes and ate poor food, dwelling peacefully in himself. He would not dare to sleep until midnight. Whenever he saw beggars, he would invariably give them food. His character was upright, sincere, dignified and grave. Even his disciples could not meet with him casually.

There was a member of the Fukatsu family, a brave merchant, who told people: "Master Kū has divine authority that makes people fear him. Every time I see him, my heart trembles and my legs shake." This shows how much people feared him.

One day he went to Mount Kasuga in Nara, visited the Myōjin Shrine, left his staff among the trees, spread grass and sat down. Suddenly he became dizzy and seemed to pass away. His attendant was greatly alarmed and called to him, but he did not respond. After a while he peacefully opened his eyes and told his attendant: "The time has come, I am going." He then searched his bag, took out an end-of-life talisman and consumed it, put his palms together facing west, and passed away peacefully.

At that time, a ray of white light arose from the western direction, and Amida Buddha appeared in the light together with the holy assembly. After a while it disappeared, but there was still residual light in the sky like white silk. None of the lay and ordained observers failed to marvel at this wonder. Suddenly an auspicious deer came and circled three times to the right, as if expressing grief. Soon the treasure door of the third hall of Myōjin Shrine opened by itself. Was this not a miraculous event? This occurred on the twenty-fifth day of the tenth month of the second year of Keian (1649). He lived fifty-eight years with thirty-nine years in the dharma.

Three days before the master's death, heavenly flowers fell in the mountains. They were exquisitely beautiful, thin as cicada wings. People competed to pick them up but did not know what auspicious sign this was. Only now did they realize these were manifested through the master's spiritual power. His disciples built a pagoda at Gokuraku Temple.

**Praise**
The dharma path has declined, and those who call themselves monks are constantly frivolous and self-indulgent. Who is there like Master Shō who was upright, sincere, dignified and grave? While people adorn themselves luxuriously and indulge in desires of food and drink, who is there like Master Shō who wore poor clothes and ate poor food, barely sustaining his body? While people frequent the gates of the powerful and wealthy, fearing only that their reputation and position will not rise, who is there like Master Shō who declined imperial edicts? From others' perspective, someone like Master Shō could be called rare. But Master Shō would say: "This is just the ordinary business of a monk, nothing difficult." Ah, is not someone like Master Shō a true bhikkhu!

**Biography of Dharma Master Shōsen Shū of Unryū-in**

The dharma master's posthumous name was Joshū, his courtesy name was Shōsen. His lay family name was Ban, and he was from Yawata in Yamashiro Province. He was born intelligent. At age nine he contracted a minor illness, and when his mother wanted to treat it with moxibustion, the master showed a refusing attitude. His mother jokingly said, "If you allow moxibustion, I will give you treasures." The master said, "Worldly treasures are not what I desire. If you permit me to read Buddhist sutras, I will follow your command." His mother was pleased, thinking this child had affinity with the Buddhist path, and had him enter Sennyu Temple to become a novice under Dharma Master Chōkoku Kenhō.

At thirteen he was tonsured, and his brilliant reputation surpassed others. In the sixteenth year of Keichō (1611), when the master was nineteen, he received full ordination under Dharma Master Gyokuei Chin and mastered vinaya studies. Later he climbed Mount Tiantai and listened to Lotus Sutra lectures at Shōgaku-in. After a long time he traveled to study in Nara. At that time at Kita-in of Kōfuku Temple there was Dharma Master Kūkei, a master craftsman of the Consciousness-Only school whose reputation was great at the time. The master immediately studied under him the various treatises on Consciousness-Only, Yogācāra, Buddhist logic, etc., and there was nothing he did not thoroughly comprehend.

In the seventh year of Kan'ei (1630), he took his staff and traveled, reaching Daigo, where he studied esoteric Buddhism under Abbot Gyōen at Muryōju-in. He especially investigated the fundamental sources of the Matsuhashi lineage. Gyōen greatly praised him. In the thirteenth year he visited Chan Master Zene Chū at Enichinzan and inquired into the essence of the single transmission. The Chan master transmitted the dharma seal to him with "dharma dependence and single pinnacle," making him a dharma heir.

Since Unryū-in had been in ruins for a long time, he wanted to restore it and petitioned the court. The emperor approved and bestowed silver. The master then constructed Buddha hall, monks' quarters, dining hall, bell tower and other buildings.

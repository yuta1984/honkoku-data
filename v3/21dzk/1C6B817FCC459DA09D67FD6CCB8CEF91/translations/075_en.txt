His aspirations were devoted to the Buddha Vehicle, and he had perfected the crown protuberance. One day he read in the *Xindi Guan Jing* (Sutra on Contemplation of the Mind-Ground): "Wife, children, treasures, and royal position - at the time of death there are none who follow. Only precepts, charity, and non-negligence serve as companions in this life and the next." This greatly awakened and moved him. He said to his attendants: "I have already left home. I wish to receive full ordination. Who would be suitable as my precept master?" All replied: "The great disciple of Kōshō Bodhisattva, Vinaya Master Shinkū, resides at Saidaiji in the Southern Capital. His spiritual worth is lofty and noble - it would be appropriate to send down an edict summoning him." The retired emperor dispatched an envoy to invite the master. The master responded to the command and entered the palace. The emperor was greatly pleased. It happened to coincide with a *uposatha* day, so following the imperial command, he performed the Brahmā's Net *uposatha*. Ascending the seat, he recited the precept text, and when he reached the passage "Even unto the attainment of Buddhahood, all is based upon precepts. Therefore, those with wisdom firmly guard and protect the precepts in their hearts. Better to lose body and life than to carelessly commit any violation," the emperor wept with emotion for a long time. From the court nobles and ministers down, none failed to wipe their sleeves. The emperor then received full ordination from the master, performing the disciple's ceremonies with great reverence. He specially designated the provincial temples (*kokubunji*) of the sixty-six provinces as branch temples of Saidaiji. The Empress Dantenmon also received the great bhikshuni precepts from the master. At this point the vinaya tradition flourished even more, no different from when Kōshō was alive in the world. In the 1st year of Tokuji (1306), in the 10th month, he consecrated Shūhōji in Sanuki and performed *uposatha* together with over sixty monks. Having lived in the world for a long time, he left his disciples behind and went wandering to other regions. This was on the 26th day of the 1st month of the 5th year of Shōwa (1316). He was eighty-six years old. His Dharma age was several decades. His disciples included Jōsen, Eishin, Ryōgen, Jōsei, Chōshin, and several others. In the 4th year of Karyaku (1329), Emperor Go-Daigo bestowed upon him the title "Priest Jishin." His imperial edict stated in summary: "The Lamp-Transmitting Great Dharma Master Vinaya Master Shinkū was pure and lofty in his precept conduct and noble and exalted in his virtue. Therefore Emperor Go-Uda received the vow-less precepts from him, and the Dantensenin perfected the vinaya discipline for great nuns. I posthumously honor his virtue and bestow upon him the posthumous title Priest Jishin."

The encomium states: I have examined the Divine Oracle Record of Master Kyōe, which says: "The deity Miwa possessed a seven-year-old girl who rose into the air seven feet high, leaping with joy without ceasing. Bystanders wondered and asked why this was so. She said it was because she rejoiced that Śākyamuni of Vulture Peak and Kāśyapa of Cock's Foot had manifested in this realm to teach the Dharma and save beings. They asked who these were. She said they were Saint Shien of Saidaiji and Master Jidō of Hannyaji." From this we know that Kōshō Bodhisattva was a responsive manifestation of Śākyamuni, and the master was also Kāśyapa's return. Ah, how extraordinary were the master's various practices! Though the details seem unknowable, citing this evidence and reasoning from it, we can certainly trust that his spiritual path transcended the ordinary.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Kaiin Shū of Senpukuji**
The vinaya master's religious name was Genshū, his courtesy name was Kaiin. His family name is unknown. His innate nature was sincere and truthful. He left lay life to become a monk and served Kōshō Bodhisattva as his teacher, receiving instruction. After progressing to full ordination, he was precise in vinaya studies and his spiritual practice was especially valued by people of the time. He built Senpukuji and became its first abbot. In the 2nd year of Kōchō (1262), when the master was seventy years old, Kōshō had business in the Kantō region and summoned the master to oversee Saidaiji. The master saw Kōshō off at the banks of the Kizu River, prostrated, and said: "This twilight of mulberry and elm trees neighbors death itself. How can I hope to gaze upon your compassionate countenance again? Nevertheless, my vow is to assist and praise my root teacher life after life, propagating the Dharma and benefiting beings. Even if it takes hundreds of thousands of millions of eons, I will never retreat." He then chanted a verse: "I vow that in life after life I may attend the master,

**Left Page Upper Section**
Like a shadow following form, never departing for a moment. Propagating Dharma, benefiting beings, assisting in profound transformation - through dust-mote eons and seas of kalpas, I will never decline." When he finished chanting, tears flowed down his cheeks without his knowing it. Could his spirit of revering the Dharma and honoring his teacher be any more complete? When the master entered nirvana, the great deity Kashima in the Kantō region gave an oracle saying: "Vinaya Master Genshū has abandoned the human world and attained middle grade, middle birth in the Western Paradise." When Vinaya Master Ninshō heard this, he was amazed and sent an envoy to inquire - indeed, it was the master's final moment. Monks and laypeople who heard this all felt moved to faith and admiration.

The encomium states: The *Guan Jing* considers serving teachers and elders to be the true cause of pure karma. This is verified in Master Shū.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Kenmyō Sai**
The vinaya master's religious name was Jisai, his title was Kenmyō. His family lineage is unknown - he was from Yamashiro Province. His childhood name was Tamon. From youth he was intelligent and quick, unwilling to remain content in lay life. In the 1st year of Kangen (1243) he relied upon Kōshō Bodhisattva, shaved his head and took the dye, studying the supramundane Dharma. After receiving full ordination he entered under Great Compassion Bodhisattva, devoted his mind to vinaya studies, and carefully investigated the profound meanings. He also received esoteric teachings at Kairyūōji. Later he resided at Gokurakuji in Sagami Province. His spiritual reputation was lofty and pure, valued by monks and laypeople alike. One evening he dreamed of composing *renga* (linked verse) with Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva. That poem is recorded in the *Shasekishū*. The master's final whereabouts are unknown. He had a Dharma-heir disciple, Vinaya Master Zengan'nin.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Chūkan Zen of Keigūin in the Capital**
The vinaya master's religious name was Chōzen, his courtesy name was Chūkan. His lay family was the Hata clan, and he was from Ogurisu in Yamashiro Province. In the 3rd year of Kenchō (1251) he received full ordination from Kōshō Bodhisattva. He maintained strict observance with an unwavering mind, eliminating all flaws. He once studied the Three

**Left Page Lower Section**
Treatises at Tōdaiji and also learned esoteric teachings from Archbishop Shinkai of Kakudōin at Daigo, completely mastering their profound depths. For several years he resided at Keigūin in the capital, greatly practicing vinaya. With his remaining energy he repaired and renovated the temple buildings. His spiritual reputation spread far and wide, and the four assemblies took refuge in him. Therefore Keigū established the master as the founding patriarch of vinaya propagation there. Once while at Daigo, he practiced esoteric methods for a thousand-day period and experienced relics manifesting on the altar. Also, the various deities of Ise, Hachiman, and Seiryū regularly appeared and expounded the profound meanings of exoteric and esoteric teachings. Sometimes they praised the subtlety of his contemplative methods, sometimes they praised the strict purity of his precept conduct. Such spiritual responses were varied and cannot be exhausted in a single account. The details are in the Divine Oracle Record compiled by the master, which I will not elaborate upon here. He passed away on the 2nd day of the 2nd month of the 2nd year of Tokuji (1307). His worldly age was eighty-one, his monastic age fifty-six. His writings include the *Sanron Gengi Kenyū Shō* and several other volumes.

The encomium states: That disciplined conduct can move people is certainly difficult, but being able to communicate with divine beings is especially difficult. Now this Vinaya Master Zen repeatedly moved various deities to respond. If his virtue and conduct did not surpass others, how could he have reached such a level?

**Biography of Vinaya Master Chōzen Son**
The vinaya master's religious name was Kōson, his courtesy name was Chōzen. It is not known where he was from. He left home at a young age and possessed both understanding and practice. He followed Kōshō Bodhisattva and presented himself as a northern-facing disciple. In the 8th year of Kenchō (1256) he received the *śikṣamāṇa* precepts, and in the 2nd year of Kōgen (1257) he progressed to full ordination. He thoroughly investigated the textual meanings of the various sectarian scriptures, and became renowned for the two teachings of vinaya and esotericism. In the 4th year of Bun'ei (1267) he received complete *abhiṣeka*. Thereafter he resided at Kairyūōji as the fourth-generation abbot and greatly

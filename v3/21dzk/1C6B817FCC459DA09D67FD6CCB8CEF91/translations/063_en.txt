**Biography of Great Flourishing True Dharma National Master, Founder of Sennyu-ji Temple in the Capital**

The National Master's religious name was Shunjō. His courtesy name was Gazen. He styled himself "Fukaki" (The Irreplaceable). He was from Hita District, Higo Province. His mother was of the Fujiwara clan. When first born, his mother abandoned him under a tree. After three days and nights he was free from harm by birds and beasts. His elder sister saw this and considered it strange, took him in her arms, returned home and gave him to their mother for nursing. At age four he relied on Master Chingō of Ikebedera Temple to study Buddhism. Chingō was the master's maternal uncle. The master was intelligent and brilliant, with an air of outstanding excellence. Among the children he was like a jewel among tiles and stones. At seven he read Sanskrit texts and could immediately memorize them. At ten he went to follow Master Shōgon at Mount Gohira and was taught the Lotus Sutra. He mastered it in six days. The master valued his capacity and sent him to Gakutō Shinjun of Mount Iida. Shinjun was a disciple of Tendai Zasu Chūjin Sōjō, one deeply versed in exoteric and esoteric teachings. The master received close instruction and absorbed his learning, his diligence surpassing others. At eighteen he shaved his head. The following year on April 8th, he received full ordination at Kanzeon Temple in Dazaifu and became a great monk. When Master Shunjun passed away, he then studied under his dharma brother Sōjun. He exhausted the profound essence of exoteric and esoteric teachings. One day he sighed deeply and said: "Among the three studies, only the precepts serve as foundation. If one does not maintain them precisely, how can one become a model for attaining buddhahood?" He then diligently practiced brahmacarya, shouldered his books and left the western pass, traveling back and forth between the southern and northern

capitals. He inquired into the meaning of vinaya from various renowned masters. Eventually he returned to his home region and built a temple on Mount Tsutsudake called Shōbōji. Monks gathered to about one hundred people. The established regulations were solemnly maintained. In Ajiki County there was Zasu Kei. He dreamed of climbing Mount Tsutsudake and meeting a divine monk who told him: "Master Jō is one who has practiced the way for five hundred lifetimes. If you wish to seek liberation, you should form excellent karmic connections with him." Kei awakened, went to the temple, bowed to the master, and related his dream. All who heard were amazed. Also, when the daughter of provincial official Hata died, they begged him to shave her head and give her precepts. Her mother wept saying: "For my deceased daughter to receive head-shaving and precepts from the master was precisely her earnest wish. I do not know what dharma power could enable her to revive for a moment to let her know this situation." The master performed esoteric rites. The next day the daughter came back to life. When her parents asked about her condition, the daughter said: "I was aware of going to the master's initiation room, heard the dharma with joy, and suddenly it was like awakening from a dream. I truly did not know I had died." The parents' joy was boundless. In the ninth year of Kenkyū (1198), when the master was thirty-three years old, he said to himself: "I have studied the major and minor vinaya texts but have not exhausted their meaning. I must enter Great Song and verify my doubts." He then told his disciples: "I wish to seek dharma in other lands. If you do not strive earnestly, how could you be worthy of transmission? Now I set one hundred days as the period to train rigorously with you all day and night." He then kept a meditation staff, taking turns to encourage vigilance. During the day he taught dharma to the assembly; at night he sat in meditation until dawn. His eyes never closed. When the period ended his spirit became even more vigorous. The following year in April he led his two disciples Anjū and Chōga, boarded a merchant vessel and arrived at Jiangyin. This was the fifth year of Qingyuan under Emperor Ningzong. He toured famous monasteries in the two Zhe regions, climbed Mount Tiantai, crossed Stone Bridge, and made offerings to the Five Hundred Arhats at Pancake Peak. He experienced flowers appearing in tea. He also went to Xuedou to inquire about Chan essentials and called on Chan Master Mengan Cong at

Mount Jing. In the spring of the sixth year, hearing that Vinaya Master Ruan Liaohong had established a dharma banner at Jingfu Temple, he hurried to rely on him. He studied vinaya without abandoning day or night. All matters of what was permitted or prohibited, what to maintain or violate, dissolved clearly like melting ice. Therefore Master Ricchūzan Ippū said: "Japanese Master Jō's earnestness for dharma - during the Qingyuan period he took a ship and came from the east. At that time former master Ruan was teaching dharma at Jingfu. Jō immediately studied there for over ten years. Due to the different language he could not understand, so they often sat separately for individual instruction. Jō then engaged in discussion, not wasting even a moment. Major and minor division texts, the teachings and contemplations of the entire school - there was nothing he did not comprehend." In the second year of Jiatai he traveled to Taizhou and resided at Chicheng Temple. In the third year he paid respects at the pagoda of Great Master Zhizhe and spent the summer at Daci Temple in Folong. At that time Master Beifeng Yin was based at Chaoguo Teaching Academy in Huating County, Xiuzhou, propagating Zhizhe's three contemplations. The master came to sit under him and served diligently for a long time. He thoroughly penetrated the source of Tiantai teachings and contemplations. One day Master Yin, regarding teachings and contemplations, presented five test questions. The master's answers were supreme. Generally in Tiantai teachings where meanings touched on vinaya, he deferred interpretation to the master. He then said to the assembly: "If you have anything you do not understand, you may ask Shunjō." At that time all students in Beifeng's assembly were men of outstanding talent. They all relied on the master for clarification. In Huating there was the Zhang family. Their son had been bedridden with illness for three years. They sought Yin to pray for safety. Yin said: "The Japanese monk Jō possesses complete wisdom and practice. Even I do not measure up to him. You should seek him out." The Zhang family's pleading was sincere and urgent. The master performed the Acala messenger ritual. He set a period of seven days. On the fourth day the candles on the altar went out. The master reported to Yin: "In the ritual for disaster relief, when lamps and candles extinguish themselves, the wishes will not be fulfilled." Yin said: "The Zhang family's sincerity is pitiable. Generally evil does not overcome virtue. Try again with full sincerity." The master had no choice but to pray with utmost devotion. On the seventh day their son's illness

was cured. The whole family rejoiced. Yin asked the master: "Is the Zhang son without affliction?" The master said: "Fixed karma is difficult to escape. Through the power of the principal deity's great compassion, it can be delayed by nine months." Three months later their son indeed died. There was also Zhou's wife. She had conceived several times but all were difficult births. The torture was extreme, and after birth none survived. Unfortunately she conceived again. After three years she had not yet given birth. Hearing of the master's dharma power, she earnestly requested rescue and protection. The master performed the Seven Buddha Medicine Master ritual. On the seventh night his wife dreamed. A child said: "I am your old enemy. I have long wished to end your life. Fortunately meeting Eastern Master Jō who resolved my enmity and enabled me to ascend. From now on, I will no longer be your enemy." After awakening the pregnancy stopped and her suffering was immediately removed. The whole household marveled. His wife then generated great faith, bathed and put on pure clothes, and with colored thread embroidered images of Amitabha Buddha, Avalokiteśvara, and Mahāsthāmaprāpta. It took about three years to complete, to repay his virtue. While the master was in Elder Yin's assembly, there were many occasions when he outshone Yin. Fellow monastery monk Master Shanming left a letter stating briefly: "Japanese Vinaya Master Jō's moral conduct and virtue - the scholars and common people of Huating revere him like a buddha. In prayers and mantras, driving away evil and warding off disasters, all have spiritual response. He is truly comparable to the holy monks of antiquity." In the first year of Jiading he left to travel to the upper capital and lodged at Lower Tianzhu. Daily he debated Tiantai teachings with various elders, and all admired his brilliance. Even high ministers and officials all enjoyed associating with him. Men like Prime Minister Shi, Minister Qian, Counselor Lou, and Yang Zhongliang had the greatest faith in him. The master posed fifty-three doubts about the vinaya school to question contemporary vinaya masters. Liaoran of Lin'an, Jinghui of Zhiyan, Miaoyin of Jingfan, Zhirui of Kuaiji and others each provided responses. The renowned scholar Puweng of Shanyin painted portraits of Nanshan and Lingzhi.

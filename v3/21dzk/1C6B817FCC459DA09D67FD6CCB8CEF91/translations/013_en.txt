though they established ritual forms, they did not raise the matter of returning to precepts. How could this be due to being ignorant of doctrinal aspects with some things left undone? They simply wished to show what was left behind and defer the merit to later generations. Kāla's translation of the precepts followed the same pattern. This is the ultimate discussion. Why add superfluous words?

**Biography of Vinaya Master Daofu of Yunzhong, Northern Wei**
The Vinaya Master's name was Daofu. His clan lineage is not detailed. He was a distinguished disciple of Vinaya Master Facong. His innate nature was keen and sharp, his understanding and capacity surpassed the crowd. When he reached the point of receiving ordination, he relied on Facong to study the Dharmadhātu school thoroughly. He first created commentary and explanation for it, becoming a giant leader of the *Dharmaguptaka*. None under heaven surpassed him. Therefore students looked up to him like auspicious clouds and bright stars. Those who came under his teaching wheel were all outstanding vessels of the time, such as Dayan and Yunyin. Later his end was unknown. His chief dharma-heir was Vinaya Master Dajue Huiguang.

Praise says: Master Fu entered the forge and bellows of the Northern Platform and became pure gold refined a hundred times. He opened the mouth that for a thousand ages none dared open. He first produced the *Dharmaguptaka* Commentary to benefit later students with virtue and wisdom. Could his merit be less than Yu's? Some wonder: the two Vinaya Masters Cong and Fu had great virtue and morality, yet their biographical details are not extensive. Alas! Biographical details are superficial, not fundamental. Virtue and morality are fundamental, not superficial. If one takes the abundance or scarcity of what is superficial to judge the high or low of what is fundamental, this shows shallowness in knowing people. When I read the *Records of the Grand Historian*, Yan Zi and Min Zi had great virtue, yet their deeds don't fill a page. Do you understand this?

**Biography of Vinaya Master Fachao of Tianzhu Temple, Yangdu, Liang Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master came from the Meng clan, named Fachao, a native of Wuxi in Jinling. From childhood he was intelligent and perceptive, with a pure aspiration

to transcend the dusty world. At exactly eleven years old, he shaved his hair at Linggen Temple. After receiving precepts, he loved learning tirelessly. He followed Senghuo of the same temple to consult and resolve questions about sūtras and śāstras, thoroughly understanding their profound mysteries in his heart and mind. He maintained pure poverty and preserved his principles, supporting himself through begging. Others could not bear such toil and hardship, yet he handled it with joy. At that time Vinaya Master Zhicheng was propagating the teaching at Anle Temple. The Master went there to study under him. He thoroughly studied the *Daśabhāṇavāra Vinaya* and developed especially profound understanding. When Cheng passed away, he emerged and went to the capital, greatly promoting the teachings. His reputation resonated throughout both monastic and lay communities. Students then came like rice, hemp, millet, and reeds. Emperor Wu focused his attention on the teachings, delighting in goodness as if he couldn't keep up. Hearing of the Master's virtue, he issued an edict appointing him as Monastic Supervisor of the capital. He said: "May this help guide the community of disciples and establish proper models." The Emperor also said: "Vinaya teachings are what the age of the Dharma image relies upon. Learning and wisdom advance gradually; they are essential for governing the body and eliminating sins. The Three Sages return through this. It absolutely cannot be lacking." He then extracted from the extensive vinaya texts and compiled the *Essential Vinaya Procedures* in fourteen volumes. It was widely practiced in the world. In the sixth year of Putong, the Emperor summoned the Master to ascend the teaching seat in Pingdeng Hall. The Emperor and his hundred officials personally listened to the lectures and chanting. The Master considered that vinaya was secret and supreme, not accessible to outsiders. So with skillful eloquence he presented its essential points. The Dragon Countenance was greatly pleased, and the four assemblies believed and submitted. In the winter of the seventh year, he announced his passing in the main quarters of Tianzhu Temple. His worldly lifespan was seventy-one years, monastic years a certain number. The Emperor issued an edict of condolence and had the hundred officials attend the funeral. He was enshrined in a pagoda at Kaishan Temple on Zhong Mountain.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Daochan of Yunju Temple, Zhong Mountain, Liang Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Daochan, from Jiaozhi. His clan lineage is not detailed. In his tender years he escaped the dusty net, responded to the Dharma, and received full ordination. His established nature was dignified and stern, his bodily conduct pure and simple. Among the black-robed and white-robed people of his native place, none failed to respect his demeanor. Initially at Xianzhou

Mountain Temple, tigers frequently injured people. When the Master took residence there, those disasters finally ceased. Was this not a manifestation of his spiritual power? At that time he heard that Prince Jingling of Qi had greatly established lecture halls, with many monks of meditation and vinaya coming to dwell there, all being those called heroes among dragons and elephants. He immediately went to rely on them. He applied encouragement and effort, burning artemisia to continue through the night hours, leaving no profundity unexplored, no essence unresearched. In early Yongming, he moved to reside at Yunju Temple on Zhong Mountain. He lectured and studied on the vinayas of various schools. In the *Daśabhāṇavāra* he particularly distinguished himself with reputation and brilliance. Monks and nuns came to rely on him like clouds returning to mountain peaks. Eventually he concealed his traces in secluded forests and did not associate with court nobles. With cloth robes and coarse food, he was abundantly content as if having surplus. If he obtained fine flavors, he would immediately give them to poor and sick people. He never had the slightest trace of attachment or stinginess. Throughout each day he concentrated his mind in dhyāna and no longer knew there was a human world. In a certain month and day of the first year of Datong, he manifested illness and departed the world. He lived seventy years. His precept-transmitting disciples numbered more than one thousand.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Hongdu, Liang Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Hongdu. It is not detailed where he was from. His clan name is also unknown. In the first year of Datong, year yimao, there was a recluse named Zhao Boxiu. He released the Master at Lu Mountain and obtained the *Record of Marks by All Sages* which said: After the Buddha's nirvana, Venerable Upāli compiled the Vinaya Piṭaka. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month of that year, after completing the pavāraṇā ceremony, he made offerings to the Vinaya Piṭaka with incense and flowers, then placed one mark in front of the Vinaya Piṭaka. He did this year after year. After Upāli, the masters transmitted it successively until Saṃghabhadra. In the sixth year of Qi Yongming, together with the monk Sengyi, he translated the *Samantapāsādikā* in eighteen volumes at Zhulin Temple in Guangzhou. They immediately entered retreat together, and on the fifteenth of the seventh month of the seventh year, following the method of previous masters, they made offerings to the Vinaya Piṭaka with incense and flowers,

then immediately placed one mark. In that year they obtained a total of 975 marks. Boxiu then asked the Master: "Since the seventh year of Yongming, why are no more marks seen?" The Master replied: "Before that time, all were enlightened sages who personally placed the marks. We disciples are merely ordinary beings. We can only respectfully maintain and honor it with reverence. Therefore we no longer place marks." Boxiu calculated from the old marks up to the first year of Datong, a total of 1,020 years. The Master's final generation cannot be ascertained in detail.

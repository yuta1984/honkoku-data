emerged into the world at Changle Temple. His reputation spread far like wings in flight, and the monastic community looked up to him with reverence. He departed from the world in the second year of Daming at the age of eighty-four. His monastic years are not recorded in detail.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Sengqu of Zhuangyan Temple, Jingzhao, Liu Song Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Sengqu. He was born into the Zhu family, a native of Wu State. He entered under Vinaya Master Sengye's tutelage, left the householder's life, and studied the transcendental Dharma. His natural disposition was upright and honest, his wisdom and understanding unparalleled. After ascending the ordination platform and receiving precepts, he mastered numerous sutras and excelled in the *Daśabhāṇavāra*. He also studied Confucian texts extensively, his literary compositions were grand and abundant, and he skillfully constructed new expressions. Initially he resided at Xuqiu Mountain in Wu. The young emperor revered the Master's virtue and received the five precepts from him. When Emperor Xiaowu ascended the throne, by imperial edict he was appointed as Sangha Administrator (*sengzheng*) overseeing the community, presiding over Zhongxing Temple in the capital. At that time there was a monk named Sengding who claimed to have attained the fruit of non-return. The Master gathered the sangha for detailed investigation and said to Ding: "If you have truly realized the Way, you should manifest spiritual powers." Ding replied: "I fear violating precepts, so I do not manifest them." The Master said: "According to the vinaya texts, there are four conditions under which one may manifest spiritual powers: first, to cut through the net of doubt; second, to破 destroy wrong views; third, to eliminate pride and arrogance; fourth, to accomplish merit and virtue. Now the conditions already exist - what violation would there be?" Ding remained silent. His falsehood having been exposed, he was expelled that very day. The Master then composed the *Admonition to the Assembly* to demonstrate to future generations. The Master's maintenance of vinaya was outstanding and strict, his learning penetrated both inner and outer [Buddhist and secular knowledge], and his reputation spread without distinction between north and south. Not only did monastics flock to him, but contemporary distinguished ministers and nobles like Prince Zishang of Yuzhang, Yuan Can, and Zhang Fu all admired his influence and formed transcendental friendships with him. In his later years he moved to Zhuangyan Temple, manifested illness and passed away. His worldly life spanned fifty-eight years. His retreat seasons numbered a certain amount. His writings included the *Śrīmālā Commentary* in several volumes and *Essential Matters for Monks and Nuns* in two volumes.

Praise says: The *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya* states: "If a bhikṣu, having no real knowledge, claims of himself 'I have attained the superior human dharma, I have already entered the holy wisdom and excellent dharma,' except for cases of overweening pride, this bhikṣu commits *pārājika* and cannot dwell in community." Such is the Buddha's regulation. What manner of person was Sengding that he dared to deceive the ancient Buddha? When Master Qu raised this matter and expelled him, during that investigation he was stern and inviolable, no less than when Śāriputra expelled the two bhikṣus Aśvaka and Punarvasu. That he was appointed Sangha Administrator by imperial edict was surely not in vain.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Daoyan of Pengcheng, Liu Song Dynasty**  
The Vinaya Master's name was Daoyan, from Xiaohuang in Yongqiu. The records have lost his family name. From childhood his wise nature was outstanding, surpassing his peers. After cutting his hair and receiving precepts, his moral conduct was most strict. He intensively researched the four [vinaya] divisions and harmonized the various schools. When the vinaya divisions spread eastward, Sanskrit and Chinese had different sounds and the texts were somewhat inconsistent. The Master feared that future generations would have nowhere to turn for consultation, so he compiled their essential points and named it *Decisive Corrections to the Four-Division Vinaya*. Those accomplished in precept studies competed to read it with absorption. Later he traveled to Pengcheng and greatly propagated the Vinaya Piṭaka. His reputation in the Way was brilliantly manifest. In his later years he manifested illness and entered nirvana. He lived in the world for seventy-five years.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Sengyin of Pipa Temple, Jiangling, Liu Song Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Sengyin, from Longxi in Qin Province. His lay family name was Li. His family had been orthodox believers for generations. The Master was intelligent and sharp from childhood, establishing aspirations that set him apart from others. At age eight he was tonsured and immediately able to maintain long fasting. Subsequently he ascended the platform and received full ordination, intensively pursuing vinaya studies. Pure and austere as ice and snow, he most thoroughly mastered the *Daśabhāṇavāra*. He also studied the *Lotus Sutra* and *Vimalakīrti Sutra*. Hearing that Dharma Master Xuangao had established the banner of True Dharma in Western Liang Province with both meditation and wisdom flourishing, he quickly went to study under him. He was immediately able to reach its profound mysteries. When Gao passed away, he took up his staff and traveled west to Ba and Shu, then returned eastward to stop at Pipa Temple in Jiangling. Drifting transcendently like a solitary cloud or wild crane with nowhere to be obstructed, he soon received instruction from Huiche. Che was also one renowned in the four directions for virtue. The Master repeatedly consulted and inquired, his wisdom and understanding advancing daily. His reputation arose brilliantly throughout the Jing and Chu regions. The provincial governor Prince Liu Xiuyou of Shanyang and Chief Clerk Zhang Dai both received refuge precepts from the Master. Later Regional Inspector Prince Xiuruo of Baling, Prince Jingsu of Jianping, and other great figures of the time all took him as their refuge. In his later years he contracted a minor illness. One day he called his attendants and asked: "Is the sun approaching midday?" They answered: "It's already midday." He then requested water to rinse his mouth, his countenance serene as he passed away in sitting meditation. His worldly lifespan was eighty years. His Dharma years are not recorded in detail.

Praise says: Observing Master Yin's life, death, going and coming were transcendent as if in play. Thus those in the world who cling to [either] doctrinal study [or] meditation while sweeping away vinaya, constantly using "restraint" to oppress people, might also reflect on this.

**Biographies of Three Vinaya Masters: Daobiao, Huiyao, and Chengju of Liu Song Dynasty**
Vinaya Master Daobiao - his place of origin is unknown. His learning and conduct were both elevated, his moral integrity transcendent and remote. Emperor Ming, hearing of his virtue and reputation, sent Prince Ye of Jinxi to request precepts from him. Vinaya Master Huiyao - his family name is not recorded in detail. He resided at Qixuan Temple. Naturally gifted with sharp wisdom, he was proficient in the *Daśabhāṇavāra Vinaya*. Vinaya Master Chengju opened the Dharma at Shangming Temple in Jiangling. He was also skilled in the *Daśabhāṇavāra* as well as the *Saṃyuktābhidharma* and *Abhidharma*, etc., and had a reputation for outstanding learning and understanding.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Daofang of Changle Temple, Guanghan, Liu Song Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Daofang. He came from the Zhang family, a native of Wucheng in Guanghan. From the time of tonsure and receiving precepts, he was dedicated to vinaya studies. His conduct and practice were pure and chaste. He resided at Changle Temple in Guanghan. Whenever he paid homage to the Buddha and burned incense, he could sense the incense smoke rising straight into the Buddha's crown. He constantly encouraged his disciples to reform their evil ways and practice good. For those who would not reform, he would shed tears and plead with them, never stopping until they complied. When he passed away, his worldly lifespan was 120 years. His Dharma years are not recorded in detail.

Praise says: Guiding disciples without realizing his own tears fell - his heart for others was like a loving mother caring for her child, taking one step and looking back three times. How benevolent this was! To enjoy a lifespan of 120 years - was this not one whose Way was profound and fortune enduring? The saying goes: "The benevolent live long." Surely this refers to such a person.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Zhenwu Zhiyuan of Puti Temple in Qiantang, Song**
The vinaya master was named Yunkan. History does not record his surname and personal name. He was a native of Qiantang. In his youth he shaved his head under Great Master Huisi of the Tiantai Chongjiao tradition. He entered under Vinaya Master Zewu and received the dharma. In all schools of learning there was nothing he did not thoroughly comprehend. What he was especially detailed in was the vinaya section. During the Qingli era, when he opened [teachings of] the dharma at Puti Vinaya Temple by West Lake in his native place, both clergy and laity rushed to gather, fearing only that they would be left behind. Afterwards he established ordination platforms at various monasteries including Zhaoqing in Hangzhou, Kaiyuan in Suzhou, and Jingyan in Xiuzhou. Year after year he ordained monks and prayed for the extension of the sacred longevity. In Jia-

**Biography of Vinaya Master Zhanshu Wan of Puning Temple in Hangzhou, Song**

**Left Page Upper Section**
The vinaya master's personal name was Lingwan, courtesy name Zhanshu. He came from the Song family. In childhood he was keen and sharp, not liking to mingle with worldly affairs. He became a disciple of Monastic Administrator Master Yunke of Kaiyuan Temple. In the second year of Zhihe, when the Master was twenty-three years old, he was tested on sutra learning and received tonsure. In that same year he received full ordination. At that time Vinaya Master Zhenwo Zhiyuan was opening his crimson sha [teaching seat] at Puti Vinaya Temple by West Lake. The Master went with his fellow student Zhongqing to receive instruction there. He investigated sutras and vinaya, also studying the writings of the nine schools and hundred philosophers. Thus he became comprehensively learned in both inner and outer [teachings], thoroughly understanding Confucianism and Buddhism, and his reputation arose. Subsequently he returned to his native place together with Zhongqing. Qing raised funds from various donors and rebuilt the ordination platform. It was just completed when he died. The Master, seeing that the platform had not yet established Buddha statues, wanted to establish them. The assembly rather disputed this. The Master brought out the "Ordination Platform Sutra" to verify it. Thereupon the entire assembly fell silent in submission. The design and measurements of the platform hall were all determined by the Master. He also built a Nanshan Portrait Hall to the left of the platform compound. Soon, following the assembly's request, he emerged into the world and resided at Kaiyuan. There was Master Faming Zhong, a famous craftsman of that era. One day he passed by the gate and happened to encounter the Master lecturing. He therefore went in to listen. When the lecture ended, he grasped the Master's hand and said: "In our region, only the Master alone is skilled at lecturing." Thereafter, whenever anyone came to the gate, he would direct them to follow the Master. Later he opened [teachings of] the dharma at Puning Vinaya Temple. Monasteries like Changning, Dong'an, and Benji were also places the Master administered. In his later years he presided over the seat at Dayun. Students from far and near, hearing of his reputation, gathered like spokes of a wheel. The buildings reached the point where there was no room to accommodate them. The Master guided and led according to capacity, never expressing weariness. People of the time honored him with the title "Vinaya Master." In his spare time from lecturing on vinaya he diligently engaged in construction and repair; donors poured out their wealth. All buildings large and small were made completely new. He accordingly sculpted images of the vinaya lineage ancestors and arranged them for worship in a pavilion. He designated the dharma teaching hall as the "Vinaya Lecture Hall." Minister Tang Gou recommended the Master as Monastic Judge. Not long after, he was promoted to Deputy Monastic Administrator. Minister Zhang Ji had a stern and resolute nature and rarely associated with people.

Seeing the Master, joy showed in his facial expression. His reception and courtesy were especially generous. When he was appointed Chief Monastic Administrator, he was given a certificate authorizing him to display the plaques of "Universal Vinaya Monastery." Minister Yang Fan personally wrote the plaque characters. Moreover, knowing the Master's fairness and integrity, he entrusted all monastic affairs to his judgment and disposition. The Master's faith and vow regarding Pure Land practice of the Western [Paradise] were extremely sincere. He once commissioned craftsmen to paint images of the Three Sages of the Western [Paradise], which he carried with him and served. Whenever he had any small good deed, he dedicated it all to the Pure Land. Daily he recited the *Amitabha Sutra* forty-eight times. In addition, the *Lotus*, *Golden Light*, *Sixteen Contemplations*, *Samantabhadra's Vows*, and others were his daily practice. Whether sitting or lying down, his face never turned away from the west. If there were donations and profits, he distributed them as soon as he received them. Beyond his robes and bowl, he had only several hundred scrolls of teaching vehicles. He dearly loved the "Biographies of Those Born [in the Pure Land] at Mount Fei," had it carved on printing blocks and distributed, and explained it for the assembly. He also hand-copied the three great works of the patriarch and various vinaya texts to prepare them for study and reference. In the first year of Daguan, he showed signs of illness at Shousheng Monastery. He ordered the assembly to chant the *Sixteen Contemplations*, *Amitabha*, and other sutras. With palms joined in reverent devotion, he chanted along with their voices. About to pass away, he pointed to the Western [Paradise] and said: "This is where I am going." After a long time he peacefully stopped breathing. This was actually the fifteenth day of the ninth month of that year. He lived in the world seventy-six years, sat [as a monk] for fifty-three summers. On the twenty-third day of the tenth month of that year, his disciples cremated him in the western suburbs. When they opened the coffin and applied the torch, his skin and body were as if alive, his lips and cheeks like red lotus flowers. When the fire finished, relics covered the ground in countless numbers. In a certain month and day of the following year, they respectfully took his remaining bones and buried them in the southern suburb of Zhujing Pavilion at West Ridge. The Master lectured on the "Xingshi Chao" fifteen times, the "Jiemo Shu" seven times, the "Jieban Shu" eight times; the various minor texts cannot all be enumerated. Those who came to his gate and received transmission of the dharma, including Zhiyu and others, numbered over two thousand. They spread throughout various regions, dividing the lamp and opening transformation. Minister Wu Gong Junping praised the Master's painted portrait and extolled his virtue, saying:

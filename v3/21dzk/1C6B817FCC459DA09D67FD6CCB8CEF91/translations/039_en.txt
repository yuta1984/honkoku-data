walking meditation under trees. In his leisure from meditation and chanting, he loved composing poetry and prose. His heroic and exceptional spirit surpassed his predecessors, carrying the literary heritage of Pan [Yue], Ruan [Ji], Jiang [Yan], and Xie [Lingyun]. He once composed a verse titled "On Jinglin Temple" that read: "The stream path to Jinglin Temple is distant, Emperor Xiao left traces here. Water strikes the Luofu chimes, mountains sound the Khotan bells. Lamps transmit the fire of three lifetimes, ancient trees hold five-stemmed pines. Countless hues of mist and clouds, we only hear of the sleeping dragon of old." His long compositions and short verses can be understood from this example. Though the Master lived in hidden simplicity by the lonely shore, his name filled the circles of the literati. Therefore Daoist Pan Zhiqing of Tiantai, Zhu Fang of Xiangyang, Zhang Ji of Nanyang, Huangfu Ceng of Anding, Zhang Nanshi of Fanyang, Lu Xun of Wu Commandery, Xu Yi of Donghai, and Lu Hongjian of Jingling all became his friends beyond the dust. Whenever they met, they spent their days in refined conversation. Later he moved to Longxing Temple in Hangzhou. One day he showed illness, gathered his disciples to entrust them with final affairs, then peacefully passed away. This was actually the sixteenth day of the tenth month in the first year of Baoying. He lived twenty-five years in total. His monastic career lasted fifteen summers. At that time, whether monks or laypeople, whether they knew him or not, none failed to grieve and long for him. His disciples performed the cremation rites and erected a stele on the southern slope of the eastern peak of Wulin Mountain. The Master once composed *Treatise on Dharma-Nature* in several volumes, and his poetry and prose are also circulated in the world.

The eulogy says: "Master Yi achieved virtue internally and manifested literature externally, yet he treated glory and honor like worn sandals, letting his heart roam freely among mountains and waters. His solitary journey transcending the mundane was like a snow goose returning to heaven - looking up, one cannot reach such heights. As for the golden spring naturally gushing forth, inexhaustible when drawn from - this too was what his virtue brought about. Compared to drawing swords to stab mountains, bowing to wells and calling to heaven, there is truly a great difference. Alas, for one like Master Yi, who at that time would not hope for him to greatly turn the Wheel of Dharma? Yet his worldly lifespan was merely thus brief. How could this not cause me to feel deeply moved!"

**Biography of Vinaya Master Dengzhi Han of Huqiu Temple in Wu Commandery**
The Vinaya Master's taboo name was Qihan, Dengzhi was his courtesy name. His family descended from the Shen clan of Wuxing. His great-great-grandparents served the Chen and Sui dynasties; his grandfather and father hid their virtue and did not serve in office. The Master by nature had no inclination for worldly pursuits. In the eighth year of Tianbao, through imperial grace he obtained ordination. He was assigned to Yongding Temple. The following winter he ascended the Five-Part ordination platform and received full precepts. He was transferred to Kaiyuan Temple, thoroughly mastered the vinaya sections, and also excelled in the *Lotus Sutra*. His reputation for talent absolutely surpassed his peers. He also accepted invitations from monastics and laypeople to reside at Huqiu Temple in Wu Commandery, where he propagated the Xiangbu Vinaya. His virtuous fragrance was heard far and wide. Soon he presided over the Suhu ordination platform. In the tenth year of Dali, he entered the Flowing Water Pure Land practice hall. In deep concentration, various forms of the Western [Pure Land] suddenly appeared completely. He suddenly composed a song: "Flowing water moves with rippling waves, lotus flowers shine with precious light following. Riding the light westward - who accompanies me?" That year he suddenly showed slight illness and said to his disciples: "There is a crane flying before me. Do you see it? It must be farewell - though bodies be sacred, none are exempt." Having spoken, he turned to gaze upon the sacred image and peacefully passed away. He lived sixty-eight years with twenty-six years of monastic age. The Master's spiritual nature was profound and silent without external ornamentation; he viewed glory, fame and rich profit as if they would contaminate him. His single room was pure and empty; he was peaceful and content in tranquility. His disciples included Yinjie, Tanxuan, Dui and several others. Master Ran of Zhushan composed his pagoda inscription.

The eulogy says: "As for Master Han's usual spiritual achievements, let us set them aside for now. Just his suddenly seeing the victorious realm of the Western [Pure Land] in the Flowing Water practice hall - was this not clear evidence of his sincere devotion? His carefree contentment is clearly evident in his song lyrics. Alas, those like Master Han are not easily followed in their footsteps!"

**Biography of Vinaya Master Ruzou Ran of Zhushan in Huzhou**
The Vinaya Master's taboo name was Jiaoran, courtesy name Ruzou. His Dharma lineage traced to Vinaya Master Jiandao Zhi. He was from Changcheng, surname Xie, a tenth-generation descendant of Xie Lingyun. He left home from childhood. His bearing was composed and transcendent with extraordinary talent. After completing ordination, he listened to the Way of vinaya and explored its subtle mysteries. He also visited various meditation monasteries to understand the essential teachings, and additionally mastered Confucian classics. He especially excelled in poetry and prose; his remarkable phrases and beautiful sentences were scattered on everyone's lips. Those with understanding considered him an outstanding vessel of the Buddhist gate. He formed friendships with Lingche and Daobiao, becoming companions in forest retreats. Their reputations burned equally bright. Their conversations under wind-swept eaves and moon-lit windows continued in unbroken chains. People of the time said of them: "Zhaxi's Zhou can achieve pure elegance, Jishan's Che penetrates ice and snow, Yuhang's Biao reaches to the clouds." Scholars and officials throughout the realm - like Wei Yingwu, Lu Youping, Wu Jide, Li E, Huangfu Ceng, Liang Su, Cui Zixiang, Xue Feng, Lü Wei, and Yang Kui - all admired their refined character. Initially the Master did not oppose using poetry to attract and encourage people to enter Buddha-wisdom, but later when residing at Dongxi Cottage, he became ashamed of being known to the world through poetry and prose. He once sighed saying: "Even if one possessed Confucius's broad learning and Xu Chen's extensive knowledge, spending all day priding oneself on the Way and boasting of righteousness before one's eyes would only serve to disturb my true nature. How could it compare to facing a solitary pine, a wisp of cloud, and a meditation cushion - understanding without words, spirit harmonious in perfect stillness?" Thereupon he took his written poetry and prose and threw them into the fire, then withdrew into reclusion on Zhushan. Later Regional Inspector Li Hong governed Huzhou and bent his carriage route to visit the Master, requesting his poetry and prose. The Master said: "This poor monk has labored with brush and inkstone for over twenty years with no achievement. Searching in darkness for material burdens, I merely stirred up self and others. I discarded them long ago." Hong

searched for them among the people and barely obtained ten volumes. After reading through them once, he sighed saying: "In my early years I saw Shen Yue's literary criticism, Huixiu's Hanlin writings, and Yu Xin's poetic admonitions. What these three discussed does not begin to match this." The Master once resided at Xingguo Temple, using his clothing allowance to establish offerings for the dead and providing food for ghosts and spirits. There was a military officer named Shen Zhao who one evening arrived at Luotuo Bridge. In the bright moonlight he seemed to see several people in elaborate dress and caps. Zhao found this strange and asked: "How did you come to be here?" They replied: "East of the Xiang Yu shrine at Xingguo Temple, Master Ran is conducting offerings for the dead - we are here waiting for that." The next day Zhao went to verify this, and indeed they were ghostly beings. Also, Qian Pei, a corvée laborer from Changcheng, was returning home when he moored his boat south of Mount Lü and saw scores of people carrying food vessels and bearing bundles of silk, passing by with cheerful conversation and laughter. When he asked the reason, they said: "We are coming to attend Master Ran's offerings." The Master died at the temple during the Zhenyuan period. His age at death is not recorded in detail. His writings include *Biographies of Confucian-Buddhist Friendships* and *Classified Collection of Inner Canon Texts* totaling forty volumes, plus the *Nao-zi* in ten volumes, all circulating in the world. Later Yu Di wrote a preface to his collected works and presented them to the court. Emperor Dezong issued an edict to store them in the Secret Pavilion, and the entire realm considered this an honor.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Xiyi of Donglin Temple on Mount Lu**
The Vinaya Master's name was Xiyi. He was born to the Cao family of Guiyang. His physical presence and understanding were deep and tranquil; his bearing upright and keen. At age twenty-two he received full ordination at Nanyue. At the beginning of the Zhide era, he led the community at Donglin, advocating the Buddhist teachings. His reputation flowed and spread throughout the realm. Princes and common people alike looked up to his influence with reverent respect, and donations poured in abundantly. The Master immediately distributed everything to the community, not keeping even a hair's worth. His personal lifestyle consisted only of plain clothes and coarse food. He sat in meditation in his single room, earnestly discussing the essential teachings. In the fifth year of Dali he climbed to the Five Elders Peak, loving the secluded depths of the forested mountains, and extremely

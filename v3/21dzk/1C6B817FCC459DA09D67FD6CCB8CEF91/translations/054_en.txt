[the precepts], and sought resolution from Maitreya. Bhadra of Pinglu set his boat afloat in the middle of the river and re-received the precept teachings. Zhishou of Hongfu received the Buddha's descent and had his head touched, and only then knew that receiving precepts truly had substance. This is why the ancients were cautious and did not take it lightly. In recent times, people receive precepts with a light heart, not knowing proper methods, and there are those who have not yet reached even the inferior grade. How sad!

**Biography of Vinaya Master Xingshen of Mingqing Temple, Song**
The vinaya master was named Xingshen; his surname and given name are not detailed. His innate nature was outstanding and praiseworthy. Having already left the white robes and advanced to full ordination, he recited the *Four-Part Vinaya Text* and achieved complete comprehension in merely three days. When he happened to hear of the flourishing of Great Wisdom Vinaya Master's Dharma seat, he immediately went to rely on him. He thoroughly explored the sources and depths of all vinaya sections. He presided over Mingqing Temple for twenty years, propagating the teaching and benefiting beings, his reputation growing daily. One day he fell ill and immediately commanded his disciples to set up images and focused his mindfulness for several days. Suddenly he arose, arranged his deportment, personally chanted the *Amitābha Sutra*, recited the Buddha's name in a strong voice, and passed away in lotus position. His lifespan is not detailed.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Qingzhao Huiting of Yanshou Temple, Song**
The vinaya master was named Huiting, with the sobriquet Qingzhao. It is not clear what place he was from. He resided at Yanshou Temple in Wulin. Initially he followed Great Wisdom Vinaya Master to study the vinaya sections and cultivated Pure [Land] practice for sixty years. Whenever facing people, he invariably encouraged them with Buddha-recitation. He composed three verses for guiding Buddha-recitation. The first said: "Śākyamuni truly praised the Western [Land], the meaning of its extraordinary principal and accompanying [features] is already manifest. With faith, vows, and name-holding without other thoughts, voice by voice the mind abides in the white curl's light." The second said: "The merit body cultivated through dust kalpas, establishing a beautiful name in boundless light and life.

Therefore all Buddhas praise it—how can we not raise our voices?" The third said: "The great four-character name proclaimed by the golden mouth, success lies only in my mind's firmness. This spiritual method is simple and truly rare—once grasped, one joyfully dwells on jeweled lotuses." There was someone named Hu Yin who formed a friendship beyond worldly concerns with the Master. One day Yin became critically ill, and his son invited the Master, begging him to bestow instruction. The Master went to see him and said: "I have been on good terms with you throughout life, but have never spoken of the great matter of the final moment. How can you not know the place to settle your body and establish your life?" Yin said: "When the mind is pure, the Buddha-land is pure." The Master said: "Examine yourself, sir—in ordinary times, are there defiling scattered thoughts or not?" Yin said: "Living in this world, how could there be no scattered thoughts?" The Master said: "If so, then how can you achieve purity of mind and land?" Yin said: "With one recitation of Amitābha Buddha, how does one eliminate the heavy sins of eighty billion kalpas of birth and death?" The Master said: "Amitābha Buddha, through his great vow, cultivated for dust kalpas. His awesome virtue is vast and great, his light and spiritual power inconceivable. Therefore, with one recitation of his name, countless sins are eliminated, just as the blazing sun melts frost and snow. What doubt could there be?" Yin thereupon awakened, recited the Buddha's name in a strong voice, and passed away. The Master built a jeweled pavilion and erected images of the Three Sages, which were considered especially remarkable. There was someone named Jiang Ziren who always respected the Master's virtue. Suddenly he dreamed that a jeweled seat descended from the void, saying: "Vinaya Master Huiting should ascend this seat." It happened that fellow practitioner Layman Sun came to bid farewell to the Master, then returned home, formed the meditation mudra, and passed away. The Master went to offer incense, returned and told his disciples: "Master Sun has already gone; I too shall depart." He then gathered the assembly for Buddha-recitation and spoke a verse for them: "Recite Amitābha with every utterance, visualize the white curl with every thought. Maintaining this non-retreating mind, one will definitely be born in the Land of Peace and Nourishment." He then sat upright and departed.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Yongqin of Seven Treasures Monastery, Song**

**Left Page Upper Section**
The vinaya master was named Yongqin; his surname is not detailed. He served Great Wisdom Vinaya Master as his teacher. He understood and awakened to the complete teachings and approaches of the lineage without omission. Later he resided at Seven Treasures Monastery in Qiantang, his Way resonated in all four directions, and monastics and laypeople inclined their hearts toward him. The Master set his mind on the Pure [Land], with unwavering single resolve, daily coursing through thirty thousand Buddha [recitations]. One day his spirit traveled to the Pure Land and saw Buddhas and bodhisattvas in various extraordinary forms. He told his attendant: "I shall journey west tomorrow." He immediately gathered the assembly for Buddha-recitation, and at dawn, with palms joined facing west, passed away in lotus position. [Note: He once wrote the *White Lotus Record* commenting on Lingzhi's *Contemplation Sutra Commentary*.]

**Biography of Vinaya Master Daoyan, Song**
The vinaya master was named Daoyan, a person from Kuaiji; history has lost record of his surname. He was a disciple of Great Wisdom Vinaya Master. He concentrated his mind on vinaya studies and thoroughly mastered all sections, moreover making Pure [Land] practice his aspiration, with particularly supreme precision and diligence. One day he saw two divine beings over ten feet tall who announced: "Why do you not focus your mindfulness?" Thereupon he gathered monastics and laypeople and recited the Buddha's name for three days and nights. As it was about to conclude, he personally ascended the teaching seat to expound the Dharma and performed repentance for the assembly. At dawn he passed away right in his seat. His lifespan is not detailed. He has a *Sequential Commentary on the Precept Text with Annotations* that circulates in vinaya circles.

**Praise says:** Great Wisdom Vinaya Master always instructed the assembly: "In life propagate the vinaya; in death return to the Land of Peace and Nourishment. For one who has left home to study the Way, these accomplishments complete the task." Observing the above four masters, they were truly without shame regarding their father's clear instruction.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Ze'an, Song**
Vinaya Master Ze'an—his clan and native place cannot be ascertained. He became a disciple of Great Wisdom Vinaya Master. His innate disposition was outstanding and transcendent, his conduct strict and pure. He thoroughly penetrated the mysterious sources of both major and minor vinaya texts. None among his contemporaries did not

esteem him. The Master once criticized the later age's mistaken ornamentation of Mahāyāna while considering the vinaya school a lesser path, saying: "Vinaya Master Nanshan used the two teachings and three schools to interpret and explain the complete temporal teachings that flowed east, sharing the same meaning as Tiantai's four teachings and Xianshou's five teachings. Yet worldly scholars each protect their own schools, saying that Nanshan clearly expounds vinaya characteristics, and that practicing according to them brings rewards in human and heavenly [realms] or证证 minor fruits. How could they know that precepts are the cause of transcendental liberation and the foundation of supreme enlightenment? If one falters at the first step, one ultimately loses the path home. Moreover, our patriarch's practices, positions, fruits, and realizations rank among the wise ones like brothers. How could he establish teachings for the world yet confine people to a lesser path? Without entering his gate, how could one know its beauty and richness? To slander sages while not being sage brings consequences that are not light." His writings include *Sequential Commentary on Situation-Responsive Karma Procedures*, *Five Examples and Lecture Meanings for the Zichi Commentary*, etc., which scholars still transmit today.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Fachi of Huadu Temple, Song**
The vinaya master was named Fachi and resided at Huadu Temple. He promoted the vinaya vehicle and throughout his life concentrated his mind on the Land of Peace and Nourishment. He practiced Amitābha repentance for three years, burned two fingers to receive additional precepts, and also created images of the Three Western Sages. He recited the *Contemplation Sutra*, *Amitābha Sutra*, and *Cintāmaṇicakra Dhāraṇī*, and made a vow saying: "Shorten life in Jambudvīpa and be born early in the Pure Land." One day he had a minor illness, wept like rain while earnestly appealing and praying for guidance and reception. His Buddha-recitation never ceased, his voice audible at a hundred paces. Suddenly he saw a sixteen-foot Buddha standing on a pond, and immediately told those around him: "I have already attained middle-grade birth." He sat upright facing west and passed away.

**Praise says:** Master Chi shortened his lifespan to seek the Land of Peace and Nourishment—how ultimate was his mind of aversion [to saṃsāra] and aspiration [for the Pure Land]! How could mere verbal discussion of pure

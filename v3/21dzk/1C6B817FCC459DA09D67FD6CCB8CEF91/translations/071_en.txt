banner and proclaimed the principle of comprehensive reception of the three collections of precepts, but when the gate of his teaching was first opened, people's karmic conditions were not yet ripe, and they were often half in doubt and half in faith. Vinaya Master Ben, with his brilliant talent and great capacity, supported and assisted this teaching transformation, enabling scholars to have something to revere and thus arise in faith. His being like clouds and dragons, wind and tigers, was there not something great in this?

**Biography of Founding Vinaya Master Eshin Kū of Daitsūji in the Capital Province**
The vinaya master's religious name was Shinkū, styled Eshin, and titled Chūkan. He was born into the Fujiwara clan of the capital province, grandson of Deputy Chancellor Teino of Kinugasa, and son of Personal Guard Minor General Sadachika. He was born in the 1st year of Kennin Kinoe-ne (1204). In his young years he entered Daigoji, paid respects to Ācārya Gyōken of Rishōin, and had his head shaved. His nature was intelligent and he loved learning; whatever his ears and eyes encountered, he would immediately memorize for long periods without forgetting. Everyone marveled at this as extraordinary. He subsequently studied the Three Treatises under Dharma Master Jōzen of Tōnanin in the Southern Capital. Zen was the義龍 (doctrinal dragon) of his generation. [Jōzen] was pleased with the master's outstanding character and bones, and greatly encouraged him. The master received close instruction for years, then left to inquire southward, visiting and questioning virtually all those called great masters and profound craftsmen of the Three Treatises school, investigating and examining their profound meanings until he reached complete penetration without doubt. Eventually he returned to Daigoji and received abhiṣeka of both mandalas under the venerable Gyōken. From then on he exhaustively mastered all the secret seals and esoteric teachings of Ono and Hirosawa schools without remainder. Moreover, his wit and eloquence were sharp and quick, and wherever he went to places of debate, none dared to cross swords with him. In the 3rd year of Katei (1237), Daihi Bodhisattva opened dharma teaching at Shōin of Kōfukuji, and his reputation was highly regarded at the time. The master brought incense and entered his room, and master and disciple formed a spiritual bond. Consequently he received full ordination from Daihi. He investigated and collected the vinaya school's doctrinal texts to their most profound depths. One day Daihi said to the master: "In recent times the vinaya way is isolated and forlorn, like a thread about to break. Considering your talent, it is not ordinary - you will surely be able to support this way. You must strive earnestly!" Through this the master applied his will and

did not slacken. He constantly made it his task to support the school together with Shin'gan Ben. When he came to reside at Kohata Kannon'in, he greatly promoted dharma transformation, and his reputation shone brilliantly. He suddenly heard that National Master Shōichi was lecturing on the Zongjing Lu at Keinitsuzan and specially went to listen. The national teacher, knowing that the master was proficient in the Three Treatises, frequently praised him before the assembly and also showed him Zen essentials. The master had some realization. In a certain year he accepted an invitation from Jissōshō and went to Kaidanin in the Southern Capital, lecturing on the Lotus Sutra Commentary and Three Treatises Profound Meanings. Listeners gathered like spokes of a wheel. Ācārya Eishinsai of Kongōsanmaiin invited the master to fill the position of abbot. At that time those carrying study boxes and following him came continuously in streams. After residing there for over a year, he brushed his sleeves and returned to Kohata, but those who came to rely on him became even more numerous. In the 1st year of Kōchō (1261) he performed comprehensive abhiṣeka, with extremely many recipients, all men of reputation and virtue, such as Chūshō, Raiyū, and On. The Zen nun of Hachijō converted her residential pavilion into a Buddhist temple and requested the master to be the founding first patriarch. The master was moved by her aspiration and arose to respond. He named the mountain Banshō and the temple Daitsū. Bells and drums responded to each other, regulations were well-ordered, and it majestically became a renowned temple of the region. He especially enshrined Rokusonnō Tsunemoto Gen-kō as the temple guardian deity, because there was formerly a shrine to Gen-kō at this location. The Zen nun frequently came to pay respects, inquired about dharma essentials, and regretted meeting him so late. She then donated Iyo Province's Nii Estate to permanently provide for the monks' meals. Besides proclaiming the vinaya, the master also promoted the Shingon and Three Treatises schools and concurrently cultivated Pure Land practices. In the 4th year of Bunei (1267), when the master was sixty-four years old, it happened that Muryōjuin in Kamakura had a vacant position. The elder monks wanted to invite a great virtuous master to fill the position. The great assembly all said: "No one but Venerable Eshin would be sufficient to satisfy people's hearts." They consequently invited the master. The master firmly declined due to old age and illness, but the assembly persistently requested again and again, and he had no choice but to

go. Clergy and laity came to him like water flowing to a marsh, only fearing to be late. Although the master's years were already advanced, he tirelessly continued promoting dharma and guiding his disciples. However, his nature greatly loved tranquility; he would sit peacefully in one room, concentrating his mind on solar meditation. One day he dismissed all his disciples, sat facing west, formed Amida's meditation mudrā, and peacefully closed his eyes, as if in deep sleep. When they went to check on him, he had already departed. This was actually the 8th day of the 7th month of the 5th year of Bunei (1268). He lived sixty-five years and sat for an unspecified number of summers. The master's ocean of learning was vast and boundless; there was no school's learning that he had not traversed. In esoteric Buddhism he made many discoveries. The great virtues of the esoteric school transmitted this as "Kohata Doctrine." His writings include Commentary on the Treatise on Rebirth, Ten Causes Collection, Three Shrines Commentary, and several other volumes.

In praise it is said: Vinaya Master Kū's spiritual refinement transcended the mundane, his heroic appearance surpassed the crowd. Though he took vinaya as his foundation, he broadly traversed all schools, cultivating myriad practices together without being confined to one path. Therefore at the four seats of his teaching halls, he preached dharma and saved people; wherever his single cloud rained, none failed to receive benefit. When it came to the time of his death, his facial appearance was no different from usual times; he departed peacefully while seated, as easy as entering and leaving a courtyard. Then his outstanding brilliance - how did it compare to those who rely on glibness but are ignorant of mind-cultivation? I once visited Daitsū to pay respects to the master's portrait; his eyebrows and eyes were outstanding, his spirit gentle as spring, making people gaze with admiration without tiring. Ah, the master's true samādhi can be awakened - even the task of holding his sandals, I too would do it.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Enritsu Gen of Shōdaiji**
The vinaya master's religious name was Shōgen, styled Enritsu. His family name is not known in detail. He was a dharma successor of Daihi Bodhisattva. His temperament was profound and far-reaching, his outstanding wisdom transcendent and solitary. After taking the tonsure, hearing that Daihi's transformative influence was at its peak, he went directly to

join him. In the autumn of the 3rd year of Katei (1237), he received śrāmaṇera precepts at Jōkiin, then received full ordination at Shōin. At that time he was eighteen years old. Though his studies were broad, he took vinaya teachings as his foundation. His peers all respected him highly, considering that the dharma assembly had found the right person. During the Kangen era (1243-1247), he went to Keharadera and again received full ordination according to the separate ordination method. In the 1st year of Kenchō (1249), when Daihi passed away, the master received the testament and succeeded at Shōdai. In the winter of the 3rd year, in the 10th month, he received comprehensive abhiṣeka. He resided at Shōdai for over forty years, promoting the school's teachings, gaining great renown of his time. Those coming from the four directions to rely on him were like stars scattered and clouds gathered. Those with discernment said: "The master's upholding [of the dharma] is foremost in the present age." In the autumn of the 3rd year of Shōō (1290), in the 8th month, hearing that Kōshō Bodhisattva's illness was critical, he specially went to inquire about his condition. At that time Kōshō gathered his disciples and gave final instructions. The master stood by his side and heard his words, immediately feeling moved to tears before departing. After Kōshō's passing, when his disciples performed the distribution of property ritual, the master conducted the karma ceremony. Having long promoted vinaya and benefited living beings, no longer wishing to remain in the world, he demonstrated extinction on the 14th day of the 8th month of the 5th year of Shōō (1292). His worldly age was seventy-three, his dharma age fifty-five. His disciples included Dōgokō, Shōjunshō, Gonshōsan, Ryōjakushō, and several others.

In praise it is said: Among Daihi's various disciples who stood like jade in their time, only this master succeeded to his seat and was able to follow his father's example. His way resounded in the southern capital for over forty years; his great integrity and true practice became a standard for humans and devas. He truly had no shame in being a son who brought honor to his family.

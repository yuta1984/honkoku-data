He received [the eight-fold precepts] nine times, with verses about "earnestly one precept weighs more than a thousand gold pieces." On the twenty-third day of the twelfth month of the eighth year of Taihe, he told his disciples: "After my death, do not erect a stupa. Only create a dharani pillar of the Buddha's Crown Victorious Dharani Sutra and place it at my cremation site. I wish to rely on the merit of this pillar to benefit all sentient beings. My aspiration will then be fulfilled." Having finished speaking, he peacefully passed away. He dwelt in the bodhi ground for sixty-five summers and resided in the human world for eighty-six years. The following year on the fifteenth day of the first month, his disciples respectfully carried his shrine and temporarily interred it at Ancestral Master Stupa Hill in Longzhou. Ten thousand people attended the funeral. The year after on a certain day of a certain month, using the cremation method, they transferred and buried him at Fengxian Temple, erecting the pillar in accordance with his final instructions. The Master lectured on vinaya thirty times and had over one thousand disciples who received full ordination.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Faxiang of Kaiyuan Temple**
The Vinaya Master's name was Faxiang, surname Yu. He was from Changshui in Wu. Exceptional from childhood, he was unlike other children when observed. At seven he left home and practiced reciting the Lotus Sutra. In merely three ten-day periods he completely mastered the entire text. During the Dali years, when the Master was twenty, he went to Anguo Temple in the capital and received full ordination. He studied and researched vinaya texts for eleven years and achieved remarkable results. When he returned, students flocked to him like a marketplace. A certain prefect of Wu commandery memorialized the imperial court and established an ordination platform at Kaiyuan Temple. Valuing the Master's virtue, he recommended him as temple administrator. Having presided over the platform, he became a refuge for the assembly. Those requesting precepts increased daily. The Master's character was upright and pure. Throughout his life he never kept possessions long. He carried a water-straining bag and used it wherever he went. At places where he sat, birds would often come to roost and would not leave when driven away. On the tenth day of the twelfth month of the first year of Huichang, he said to his attendants:

"The time has come. I wish to depart." He then crossed his legs, lay on his right side, and passed away. Everyone heard clear celestial music and saw brilliant supernatural light. His worldly age was eighty-nine, his dharma age sixty-nine. On a certain day of the fourth month of that year, they moved his shrine and built a stupa at Laisu Plain. His dharma-heir disciples included Qingjun, Qinggao and several others. In the second year of Jingfu, his disciples together with Cao Xin, Prefectural Governor of Yizhou, and Wu Fang, Court Gentleman of the Supreme Court of Justice, were about to renovate his stupa when they opened it and saw that his remains were copper-colored, with all forty-two teeth intact, his tongue root uncorrupted, and colored like a red lotus. They washed him with fragrant water and enshrined him in the stupa. Later Qinggao transmitted the Master's way to Gongjing, Jing transmitted it to Xingyun, Yun transmitted it to Renbiao, and Biao transmitted it to Xuandai. Dai's conduct was pure and white. He dwelt in seclusion at Tiantai practicing meditation. After his death, cremation yielded relics.

The eulogy says: Formerly when Yilin restored the stupa of Master Ji of Cien, on the day the tomb was opened, supernatural fragrance overwhelmed people. The true body lay on its side on a brick platform, complete with forty teeth, with appearance as if alive. Now observing Master Xiang's affairs, was he not of the same class as Cien?

He greatly proclaimed the vinaya school. Previously he had dreamed of a great person in white cap and plain shoes who came and said: "In the future, the one who will reside at Nanyue and make my way great must be you." At this time it proved true. Also, once the court issued an edict to establish a vinaya treasury and ordered seven renowned monks to lecture on vinaya. The Master also answered this call. Those who wore straw sandals and carried loads, listening to lectures and requesting precepts, gathered like condensed clouds and scattered stars. Though the Master's position was high and reputation weighty, he conducted himself as if poor and humble, without a hair's breadth of self-aggrandizing intention. His demeanor was dignified and graceful, his advance and retreat all had constant principles. Prime Ministers Lord Qi Ying, Lord Li Bi, Lord Zhao Jing, Minister Cao Wang Gao, Lord Pei Zhou, Vice Minister Lord Linghu Qiao - none failed to be sheltered by his virtue. On the tenth day of the eleventh month of the fifteenth year of Zhenyuan he peacefully passed away. At that time there was celestial music and auspicious light that the assembly all saw and heard. He lived sixty-seven years with twenty-four years in the dharma. He was enshrined in a stupa at the western foot of Zhurong Peak. He ordained tens of thousands of disciples.

In the first year of Yuanhe, the assembly of Kaiyuan requested the Master to serve as first seat. The following year he was appointed monastic administrator of the prefecture. He selected land two hundred paces north of the temple and constructed a seven-bay lecture hall and six monastic quarters. Also, the area between the Huai and Si rivers was low-lying with frequent flooding, suffering water disasters annually. The Master consulted with Prefect Su Yu and others to create flood-refuge monastic quarters on vacant land west of Sha Lake. They planted ten thousand pines, firs, nanmu, tamarisk, and cypress trees. Through this people

all avoided the suffering of flooding. In a certain year, Kaiyuan Temple was destroyed by fire. The monks scattered and fled, leaving it to become a field of thorns and brambles. The Master was deeply grieved and took restoration as his own responsibility. Wang, Minister-Attendant and Military Commissioner of Xuzhou, revered the Master's virtue and appointed him acting monastic administrator of the three prefectures of Xu, Si, and Hao. Both clergy and laity were influenced, and donations poured in like clouds. The Minister-Attendant also contributed tens of thousands from his family wealth to assist the construction. Thus the Buddha hall, monastic quarters, ordination platform, sutra hall, along with gates, corridors, pavilions, granaries, kitchens and stables were all completed. The images, banners and all ritual implements within lacked nothing. Construction began in spring of the fifth year of Changqing and was completed in autumn of the first year of Taihe. The magnificent splendor was like heaven descending and earth rising. Thereupon monks gathered daily and bells and chanting constantly resounded. People from all directions were all bathed in the Master's transformative influence. On the nineteenth day of the twelfth month of the eighth year of Taihe he passed away in the abbot's quarters of his home temple. His reported age was seventy, his monastic years fifty-one. Ten days later they moved his whole body and returned it to the brick stupa west of the lake. Ten thousand clergy and laity attended the funeral. Their grief and mourning shook the cliffs and valleys. The Master propagated the teaching for over forty years, presiding over ordination platforms eight times, transforming forty thousand disciples of the four assemblies. His leading dharma heirs included Monk Liang, Yuansu and several others. Bai Juyi inscribed his stupa.

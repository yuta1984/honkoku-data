**Biography of Vinaya Master Honshō Yu of Gokokuuin**
The vinaya master's religious name was Shōyu, his courtesy name was Honshō. He entered Saidaiji and became a disciple of Kōshō Bodhisattva. He was brilliant and outstanding, transcending his contemporaries. After receiving full ordination, he mastered the vinaya section and especially exhausted the profound depths of esoteric teachings. From this point his reputation grew daily. During the Bun'ei era (1264-1275), when Kōshō was reciting the Five Great Vehicle Sutras at Sumiyoshi Shrine, the master possessed vocal talents, so he was assigned the duty of leading the chanting. The master constantly concentrated his mind on the syllable-wheel contemplation. One day while in the meditation hall entering contemplation, his body suddenly became a five-element pagoda. In the 3rd year of Shōō (1290), when Kōshō manifested illness, he attended to medicines day and night without rest. When Kōshō passed away, he personally joined with Masters Shinkū, Sōji, and others in carrying the coffin to the funeral. Also, for forty-nine days, he performed the fire ritual three times daily to repay the compassionate protection. He once presided over Gokokuuin, and monks and laypeople from the four directions turned toward him with admiration for his virtue.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Jōkaku Yu of Saidaiji**
The vinaya master's religious name was Senyu, his courtesy name was Jōkaku. He was a senior disciple of Kōshō Bodhisattva. His spirit and will were lofty and bright, intelligent and heroically outstanding. After advancing in precepts, he sharpened his blade in doctrinal studies, engaging in both exoteric and esoteric teachings. He resided at Kōshōji and greatly practiced the vinaya Dharma, developing his reputation. One day he visited Ise Tenshō Daijin Shrine, wishing to know the original form of the deity. He prayed for seven days and nights, and on the evening when the period was fulfilled, the deity proclaimed: "The First Principle Heaven Golden Wheel King, the Light-Illuminating Universal Great Sun Venerable." In the 5th year of Shōwa (1316), when the True Priest of Saidaiji passed away, his seat became vacant. The assembly especially selected the master to fill it. At this time his transformative authority became even more prosperous, and the seven assemblies looked to him with longing. He departed this world on the 29th day of the 2nd month of the 2nd year of Shōchū (1325), at the age of eighty-six. Later, Ryōshōnen succeeded as abbot of the main temple. After Nen came Kakuritsuzen, Jōshinsin, Jōkanshō, Gukakuyō, Gomyōshin, Hikoshōsan, Jienjō, Jishōyū, Dōshōson, Sonmitsuki, Shinjōsen, Enshōyo, Yūkakuchō, Honmyōsen, and others, all succeeding as abbots and having reputations that amazed the world.

They were precise in vinaya and were regarded as outstanding leaders of their time. Shin later succeeded to the seat of Ninshō Bodhisattva and resided at Gokurakuji, and those who were transformed by his teachings became even more numerous. Among his senior students was Vinaya Master Engenki, who resided at the provincial temple in Tamba Province.

**Biography of the Three Vinaya Masters Nyoen, Shūken, and Enjō**
Vinaya Master Nyoen's religious name was Aichi; Vinaya Master Shūken's religious name was Jōshin; Vinaya Master Enjō's religious name was Shingen. All were disciples of Kōshō Bodhisattva.

Each promoted their sectarian style and had brilliant reputations in their time. There was Vinaya Master Chōmyōkai who founded Hōsenji - he was a Dharma heir of Aichi.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Zuikaku E**
The vinaya master's name was Kyōe, his courtesy name was Zuikaku. He became a disciple of Kōshō Bodhisattva. Having already perfected his precept grades, his scholarly work progressed daily. He served at Kōshō's side and never departed even briefly, like Ānanda attending Śākyamuni Buddha. In the 6th year of Kōan (1283) he received complete *abhiṣeka* from Kōshō. In the 3rd year of Shōō (1290) when Kōshō manifested illness, the master was in the room personally attending to medicines day and night without rest. It can be said he exhausted the meaning of the teacher-student relationship.

The encomium states: From Kōson to Kyōe, all these masters received the precept seal from Kōshō and continued his legacy, bringing great light to the vinaya school. It is regrettable that the general outline of their practices and accomplishments is not recorded, thus lacking detailed examination.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Nichijō Ji of Sairuji in Kawachi Province**
The vinaya master's religious name was Sōji, his title was Nichijō. He was from Yamato Province, a nephew by blood relation to Kōshō Bodhisattva and his Dharma heir. His father's surname was Minamoto, name Kagechika. His mother was of a certain clan. The master was intelligent and exceptional from youth, taking no pleasure in worldly affairs. His father named him Dhāraṇī Youth. In the 2nd year of Kangen (1244) he went and took refuge with Kōshō Bodhisattva, shaved his head and received the five precepts. After progressing to full ordination, his learning combined exoteric and esoteric, and he was especially precise in vinaya. His reputation spread in tributary streams throughout the four directions. During the Kenchō era (1249-1256), when Kōshō came to Sairuji in Kawachi and opened a Dharma assembly, the residents at the foot of the mountain revered his virtue and donated the temple. Kōshō reformed the doctrinal temple into a vinaya one and commanded the master to be its abbot. From this point the sectarian style spread greatly and people from far and near took refuge. In the 2nd year of Kōchō (1262) he again received self-administered full ordination, and all who participated in that assembly were moved to tears without exception. During the Bun'ei era (1264-1275), when Kōshō completed the construction of Hannyaji and established a celebration assembly, he appointed the master as hall administrator to proclaim the Buddhist ceremonies. In the 9th year of Kōan (1286), encountering the thirteenth anniversary of his late father Kagekō, he had the Chinese monk Gyōzen write out the Lotus Sutra, carved printing blocks to transmit it, and also designated seven days to personally copy the Lotus Sutra by hand and gathered the assembly to perform penitential rites to benefit his spiritual welfare. The sutra he wrote still exists today. The spiritual responses were especially numerous - when sick people reverently placed it on their heads, their illnesses were washed away. The master also once composed the "Nun's Excerpts for Supporting Practice" to repay his mother's kindness, when suddenly he experienced over twenty *śarīra* relics manifesting in the nun's text. At that time Kōshō observed this and exclaimed in wonder: "That the feeling of filial devotion reaches even to this extent!" In the autumn of the 8th month of the 3rd year of Shōō (1290), when Kōshō became ill, the master led the assembly to Shiōin and opened the Golden Light Assembly to pray. When Kōshō had already entered nirvana, the master arrived later and gazed reverently upon

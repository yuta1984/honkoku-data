became increasingly prominent day by day. He was looked up to from far and near. Even such figures as Dharma Master Lingyu and Vinaya Master Hongzun, who were called the qilin and phoenix of their time, all personally attended his lecture sessions and never failed to admire his attainments. When Emperor Gao of Sui established monasteries and invited learned monks, the Master wished to broadly promote vinaya teachings and spread their radiance throughout the imperial realm, so he followed his original teacher into the capital region. He greatly opened lecture halls, and the fragrance of the Way became remarkably evident. The people of the Three Adjuncts (Chang'an region) admired his style. Since the vinaya division had been transmitted eastward for six hundred years, those who transmitted the precepts mostly misunderstood their essential characteristics. The five divisions were mixed together without distinction, and conflicting views were entangled in confusion. The Master deeply grieved and was pained by this, so he composed the "Excerpts on the Divisions of the Five Vinayas" in twenty-one volumes, outlining their similarities and differences and determining what should be discarded or established. This brought clear and comprehensive understanding. In the early Daye period he headed the Great Chanding Temple, where his Dharma influence became increasingly prosperous and offerings grew more abundant. The Master removed over one hundred items from the former site of Yunmen in Xiangzhou and built pagodas and temples at the two places where he had left home and received ordination. Their design was lofty, grand, solemn, and beautiful, decorated with jewels and painted with vermillion and blue. They stood majestically as models for successive generations. In the first year of Zhenguan, there was a tripitaka master from India who brought many Sanskrit texts intending to translate them into Chinese. Emperor Taizong commanded the Master to participate in the translation bureau. Whenever meanings touched upon vinaya matters, they all consulted the Master to determine correctness. In the eighth year, the Emperor newly built Hongfu Temple within Zhen'an City west of the palace for Empress Dowager Mu. Having long known the Master's conduct, he specially decreed him to be the first seat. Scholars gathered like fish scales, and when they encountered the Master's guidance and instruction, they generated great joy and comfort. The Master's established regulations were stern and strict - anyone who even slightly engaged in improper conduct would immediately have lectures suspended. Those who were lazy in study were all summoned for instruction and admonishment. Those who heard wept and without exception reformed. At each fortnightly precept recitation, he first prepared the ritual implements, decorating with flowers and incense. The entire assembly would join palms and kneel in reverent attention until the preliminary matters were concluded. The confession and purification were specifically for establishing admonishments. At each lecture he would expose faults and cleanse all heavy burdens. Therefore scholars of

vinaya competed to visit his gate. That the True Dharma's authentic tradition could flow complete and beautiful to later generations was due to the Master's efforts. On the twenty-second day of the fourth month of the ninth year, he manifested illness and passed away. He lived sixty-nine years with forty-seven monastic summers. His body remained in the coffin for eight days without change of countenance. Monastics and laypeople grieved as if losing parents. When the Emperor heard, he could not contain his sighs of regret and ordered all government departments to supply funeral materials. His disciple-followers carried his coffin for burial at Longshou Plain in the western suburbs of the capital. On this day, monks from various temples competed to carry white banners, filling the streets and lanes. A stele was erected at Hongfu Temple with text composed by Xu Jingzong. His writings include the "Essential Outline Chapters of Vinaya Procedures," "Commentary on the Smaller Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra," and other works totaling several volumes. The four groups of disciples he ordained were too numerous to count, with several dharma-heir disciples. There was a leading disciple Xuanlü living at Ximing Temple.

Praise says: The responsibility of bearing the essential principles of the Buddha-ancestors is indeed extremely weighty. It cannot be entrusted to those of shallow understanding and superficial capacity. Master Shou, with his heroically outstanding character surpassing others, bore the path of True Dharma and stood independently between the Sui and Tang dynasties, like looking at the southeastern moon among ten thousand stars. And Nanshan was precisely his worthy successor. Is this not what is meant by "deep mountains and great marshes truly produce dragons and serpents"?

**Biography of Vinaya Master Huijin of Puguang Temple, Jingzhao, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Huijin, a native of Jiangdu in Yangzhou. His father's surname was Wu, personal name unknown. His mother was of a certain clan. When she was pregnant with the Master, she lost her normal disposition - pungent, fishy, and mundane flavors were kept outside her lips. Those with insight thought the child's influence was the same as Śāriputra's. When he was born, his spiritual aspiration was lofty and far-reaching, beyond what others could attain. At barely seven years old, his heart yearned for the religious life. When he saw monks on the road, he would join his palms in a gesture of taking refuge, joyfully forgetting to return home. His father and

**Left Page Upper Section**
mother were delighted by his faith and let him depend on Dharma Master Rong to leave the householder's life. The Master's nature was especially filial and reverent - he served constantly at his teacher's side and never left him even briefly. Sometimes he would spread a mat on the ground under Master Rong's bed and lie prostrate there. His utmost sincerity was all of this type. When he happened to hear Rong lecture on the *Mahāyānasaṃgraha*, he could immediately give repeat lectures, flowing continuously like stringing pearls, causing listeners to nod with understanding. During the Renshou period he was summoned by imperial decree to follow Rong into the palace and was commanded to reside at Chanding Temple. Upon completing his full precepts, he applied even more diligent effort to the vinaya. At that time Vinaya Masters Zun and Shou had their dharma banners standing side by side, their reputations weighty in that era. The Master attended their vinaya lectures twenty times each. He also thoroughly studied the *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* and perfectly integrated the vinaya. There was nothing subtle he did not explore, nothing manifest he did not exhaust. During the Daye period, bands of rebels marched through the countryside, destroying everything they encountered with none daring to resist. The Master's expression did not change - he widely opened the granaries and provided abundant food and drink. When the rebels saw this they smiled at each other, all satiated themselves with the food and drink, called him a "fine monk," and departed. The Master's chanting voice was resonant like metal and stone. Even those who were habitually lazy, upon hearing the Master recite precepts, would prick up their ears in emotional response, only fearing his voice would stop. In early Zhenguan he was appointed first seat of Yunhua Temple, broadly expounding the essential teachings and causing震動 throughout the four directions. Students flocked to him like wind. Not long after, he transferred to Puguang Temple. His ceremonial regulations were strict and orderly, transforming the entire assembly's perspective. In the eighth year on a certain day of a certain month, he manifested illness and entered nirvana. He lived over fifty years, sitting for a certain number of summers.

Praise says: Liang's Zhizang in serving his teacher showed reverence exceeding that of a son serving his father. Once when he encountered his teacher being severely ill and not eating for many days, Zang also followed suit. Only when waiting for the teacher to take drink would Zang then take drink. Master Jin's relationship to his teacher - even Zhizang could not have surpassed it. That he harmonized with the ruler through the Way and his name resounded throughout the realm was

not without reason. Alas, one like Master Jin truly corresponds to what the great precepts teach about "being filial and obedient to parents, teachers, monks, and the Three Jewels - the dharma of ultimate filial obedience to the Way." He is worthy of emulation.

**Biography of Four Vinaya Masters: Mande, Shanzhi, Zhenyi, and Jingdao of Tang**
Vinaya Master Mande had heaven-opened wisdom and understanding, standing alone and surpassing the crowd. He was most skilled at lecturing and explanation, with students delighting in submission to him. Vinaya Master Shanzhi was broadly learned with extensive knowledge, his doctrinal understanding precise and subtle. His protection and maintenance of the True Dharma was like a fortress. Vinaya Master Zhenyi resided at Ximing Temple in the capital, exclusively wielding the handle of the Way. His distinguished reputation and outstanding achievements stood out among his peers, with contemporaries calling him a vinaya master craftsman. Vinaya Master Jingdao had pure and modest conduct with learning penetrating both inner and outer teachings. None could fathom their ends.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Fali of Riguang Temple, Xiangzhou, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Fali, secular surname Li, a native of Zhaojun. Born with extraordinary qualities, his teeth were all complete. In his years of aspiring to learning he took refuge with Dharma Master Lingyou and had his hair shaved. His appearance was perfectly beautiful and his scholarly attainments precise and complete. After receiving full ordination according to the Dharma, his mind in maintaining precepts was like protecting a floating bag. He studied under Vinaya Master Jinghong, receiving close instruction for several years. Day and night he studied diligently without cease. Regarding the *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya*, he penetrated its subtle mysteries. From this point his reputation and influence grew daily more brilliant. Among his contemporaries few could match his stature. Later he visited Master Yuan in Hengzhou, then went to Jiangnan, and returned again to Ye. He met spiritual advisors everywhere and promoted the essentials of all the divisions. Magistrate Pei Shiyuan of Linzhang revered the Master's precept model and invited him to ascend the seat and expound Dharma. Those who attended his assemblies were all dragons and elephants of the age, such as Dharma Masters Cirun and Huixiu. The Master lamented that the vinaya texts were vast and extensive while beginning students had no foundation for their aspirations, so he synthesized various explanations to elucidate the *Dharmaguptaka*. On a certain day in the tenth month of the ninth year of Zhenguan, he passed away at the former Riguang Temple in Ye. Autumn, sixth

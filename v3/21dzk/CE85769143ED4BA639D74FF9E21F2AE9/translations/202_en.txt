Argument: The text from Yogācārabhūmi is cited as evidence, stating "Bodhisattvas in the stage of conviction (adhimukti) find that even ineffective spells and techniques become effective when they use them." Regarding this, the original treatise contains this passage within the discussion of the excellent benefits of the initial aspiration of beginning bodhisattvas. If this passage is used as evidence, it should not be limited to the four roots of good but should broadly apply to the thirty mental states. Why is it used as evidence only for the four roots of good? Moreover, this passage does not clarify the meaning of the purity of the six sense faculties. Why is it used as supporting text?

Response: Although the original treatise broadly discusses the period after initial aspiration, the commentator takes the excellent aspects of position as evidence for the stage of preparatory practices. The reason is that making ineffective spells and techniques effective through their use involves using meditative power to manifest their spiritual efficacy, and this virtue is difficult to achieve in the scattered state of mind. In another section of the great treatise discussing dhāraṇī, it states: "When bodhisattvas obtain such mastery of samādhi, through this mastery they bless the various spell formulas that remove disasters and sufferings of sentient beings, making all those formulas spiritually effective." The passage quoted here has essentially the same meaning. The Xuanzan commentary on the Dhāraṇī chapter states: "Divine power and blessing have incomparable spiritual authority." The essence of what performs the blessing is mindfulness and wisdom associated with meditation. The stage of accumulation mostly dwells in external gates, while from the preparatory practices onward, one enters only the meditative state. Among "all uses being effective," discussing the superior in terms of the majority specifically corresponds to the four roots of good. Therefore, the great master selected the definitive stage among the thirty mental states as evidence for this.

The Xuanzan states: "The Yogācārabhūmi explains that bodhisattvas who have long cultivated in the stage of conviction find that even ineffective spells become effective when used. The purity of the six sense faculties must be in the pre-ground stage. It belongs to the upper level of ordinary beings, not to the lower or middle levels."

Yogācāra Treatise, fascicle 35, states: "The firmly resolved bodhisattva who initially generates aspiration has roughly two kinds of benefits from generating aspiration. First, having initially generated bodhicitta, one immediately becomes a venerable field of merit for sentient beings. All sentient beings should make offerings and also become parents to all sentient beings. Second, having initially generated bodhicitta, one can immediately receive the blessing of non-harm... When other sentient beings use ineffective spell formulas and bright formulas to cease epidemics and disasters, if a bodhisattva uses them, they still become effective, let alone those that are already effective."

Question: Can bodhisattvas in the stage of accumulation obtain the merit of purity of the six sense faculties? If they can, the current interpretation in Xuanzan places it in the stage of the four roots of good. It also states: "The purity of the six sense faculties must be in the pre-ground stage. It is the upper level of ordinary beings, not the lower or middle levels." The upper level refers to the preparatory stage. The middle and lower levels refer to the ten abodes, ten practices, etc. If they cannot obtain it, bodhisattvas in the stage of accumulation can definitely cultivate this sutra. Why don't they obtain the 8,800 and 1,200 merits? Moreover, since they already manifest the eight aspects of becoming Buddha through meditative power, why don't they obtain the purity of the six sense faculties through dharma power? Even if their stage doesn't reach the four roots of good, why don't they possess excellent functions within the scope of one four-continent world system?

Response: The awesome virtue of the purity of the six sense faculties is vast. Although this is an ordinary stage, it should be at its fulfillment. This is the characteristic possessed through the power of upholding sutras by one who has suddenly subdued the two grasping and constantly remains in a meditative mind. Therefore, the merits are fulfilled in six thousand, and the sphere of objects pervades the great thousand-fold world. The sutra says "although not yet having obtained the bodhisattva's uncontaminated dharma-born nose," and the treatise says "not yet entered the first ground." This is the stage close to the preparatory practices near the path of seeing, where one can receive a transformed body. The thirty mental states of accumulation are not all within the scope clarified by sutras and treatises. Judging the current interpretation as being only in the stage of the four roots of good preserves both text and principle. The eight aspects of becoming Buddha are still temporarily manifested and shown before sentient beings. The inner virtue of long duration should be from the stage of clear attainment of samādhi onward. The difficulty regarding the ability to exercise the excellent functions of seeing and hearing within one four-continent system is hard to determine as acceptable or not. Regarding the mutual functioning of sense faculties, there are discussions of whether partial attainment exists before the grounds and two interpretations. Following this, regarding the purity of six sense faculties, there might also be two interpretations regarding partial attainment in the accumulation stage. However, since Xuanzan and others describe this doctrine, it would be difficult for a junior scholar to readily accept it.

Question: Regarding the merits of the six sense faculties, if the nose faculty takes distant fragrances from the three-thousand-fold world, can both root and object deterioration occur? Xuanzan states "deteriorating the root but not the object." Regarding this, the nose faculty possesses contact function, and fragrance is also a contact object. If the nose faculty takes distant fragrances, both root and object should deteriorate together. Why does it say the object doesn't deteriorate? Therefore, in the later text of Xuanzan, explaining that the nose faculty takes pseudo-fragrances, it permits distant taking and deteriorates the object's nature. If the nose faculty distantly takes fragrances from the great thousand-fold world, it should deteriorate the object's nature. The before and after seem contradictory - how so?

Response: If the nose faculty takes fragrances from the three-thousand-fold world, is it root function or object function? If the object doesn't reach but is taken solely by root power, it should deteriorate the root but not the object. If the root doesn't exercise distant knowing function but the object can provide function to the distant root to be taken, it deteriorates the object's nature. How do we know this? The Sūyao states: "Perhaps when eye and ear faculties obtain the three sense objects, if they reach what can be taken, they deteriorate the root but not the object. If they don't reach what can be taken, they deteriorate the object but not the root." The meaning of examining from both sides is: if the root exercises contact function, it's the root's loss; if the object is taken without reaching the root, it's the object's loss. Following this reasoning, among root and object, whichever exercises improper function can deteriorate its nature. The Xianyou commentary divides into three categories: the nose faculty taking distant fragrances only deteriorates the root; the body faculty taking fragrances etc. doesn't deteriorate the root because it takes its proper objects, but can deteriorate objects because it draws other faculties; the eye faculty taking fragrances etc. deteriorates both root and object. Although this interpretation is skillful, why doesn't the nose taking distant fragrances deteriorate the object? If drawing one's own faculty doesn't deteriorate the object, then taking one's own object shouldn't deteriorate the root either. If distant taking deteriorates the root, then being distantly taken should also deteriorate the object. Also, when the body takes fragrances etc., it's also proper regarding the object. If drawing others constitutes loss, then taking others should also constitute loss - how so? The Mirror Water commentary has an explanation.

The thirty mental states of accumulation are not all within the scope clarified by sutras and treatises. Judging the current interpretation as being only in the stage of the four roots of good preserves both text and principle. The eight aspects of becoming Buddha are still what is temporarily manifested and shown before sentient beings. The inner virtue of extended duration should be from the clear attainment of samādhi onward. The difficulty about being able to exercise excellent functions of seeing and hearing within one four-continent world system is hard to determine as acceptable or not. Regarding the mutual use of sense faculties, there are the presence or absence of partial attainment before the grounds and two interpretations. Following this, regarding the purity of the six sense faculties, there might also be two meanings for partial attainment in the accumulation stage. However, when Xuanzan and others expound this doctrine, would a junior scholar rashly find it difficult to accept?

Question: Regarding the merits of the six sense faculties, if the nose faculty takes distant fragrances from the three-thousand-fold world, can deterioration of both root and object occur? Xuanzan states "deteriorating the root without deteriorating the object." Regarding this, the nose faculty possesses contact function, and fragrance is also a contact object. If the nose faculty takes distant fragrances, both root and object should deteriorate together. Why does it say not to deteriorate the object? Therefore, in the later text of Xuanzan, explaining that the nose faculty takes pseudo-fragrances, it permits distant taking and deteriorates the object's nature. If the nose faculty distantly takes fragrances from the great thousand-fold world, it should deteriorate the object's nature. The before and after seem contradictory - how so?

Response: When the nose faculty takes fragrances from the three-thousand-fold world, is it root function or object function? If the object doesn't arrive but is taken solely through root power, it should deteriorate the root but not the object. If the root doesn't exercise the function of distant knowing, but the object can give function to the distant root to be taken by it, it deteriorates the object's nature. How do we know this? The Pivotal Essentials states: "Perhaps when the eye and ear faculties obtain the three sense objects, if they reach what can take, they deteriorate the root but not the object. If they don't reach what can take, they deteriorate the object but not the root." The meaning of examining from both directions now is: if the root exercises contact function, it's the root's loss; if the object is taken without reaching the root, it's the object's loss. Following this reasoning, among root and object, whichever exercises improper function can deteriorate its nature. The Xianyou commentary divides into three categories: the nose faculty taking distant fragrances only deteriorates the root; the body faculty taking fragrances etc., since it takes proper objects, doesn't deteriorate the root, but since it draws other faculties, can deteriorate objects; the eye faculty taking fragrances etc. deteriorates both root and object. Although this interpretation is skillful, why doesn't the nose taking distant fragrances deteriorate the object? If drawing one's own faculty doesn't deteriorate the object, then also taking one's own object shouldn't deteriorate the root. If distant taking deteriorates the root, then also being distantly taken should deteriorate the object. Also, when the body takes fragrances etc., regarding the object it's also proper. If drawing others constitutes loss, then also taking others should constitute loss - how so? The Mirror Water commentary has an interpretation.

The Xuanzan states (as follows).

The Xianyou commentary, fascicle 4, states: "Regarding the explanation of root-object deterioration, there is a four-fold analysis. First, deteriorating the root but not the object: like the nose faculty in the desire realm smelling fragrances of palaces in the formless realm. Fragrance is an object of contact. When drawing the nose faculty, the object doesn't deteriorate the nose faculty. The nose faculty is a faculty of contact. When it distantly takes fragrance objects of the formless realm, the nose faculty takes other fragrance objects in distant separation. This is called root deterioration. Second, deteriorating the object but not the root: like the body faculty receiving fragrance and taste objects of contact. The body faculty takes objects of contact as its proper function. The root doesn't deteriorate. These fragrance and taste objects properly draw the nose and tongue faculties.

The reconciling explanation should follow the above topic.

Question: When Bodhisattva Never Disparaging bowed saying "you shall become Buddha," was he predicting active Buddha-nature, or how should this be understood? Answer: There are two explanations. One says active Buddha-nature, the other says principle Buddha-nature. Both are unclear. First, regarding the initial explanation, the Lotus Commentary states that Bodhisattva Never Disparaging's prediction demonstrates that all sentient beings have Buddha-nature. If it were active Buddha-nature, how could one say all sentient beings have Buddha-nature? Based on this, Master Jingxing said this explanation contradicts the commentary's "complete cause prediction." Additionally, the Great Master elsewhere states that complete cause predictions extend to those of fixed nature in the two vehicles. We should understand this as principle Buddha-nature. The latter explanation is also unclear. Since it already says "all practice the bodhisattva path and shall attain Buddhahood," we know it is not principle Buddha-nature.

Reconciling explanation: The text "you all practice the bodhisattva path" accords with active Buddha-nature, hence the first explanation was made. Since it doesn't discriminate between spiritual capacities and universally grants [predictions], this seems broad, so the latter explanation was established. The Buddha-land Commentary reconciles the Nirvana Sutra with two meanings. First it says "regarding the true-suchness Dharma-body Buddha-nature," then "accomplishing a portion, all have the nature." The present Profound Praise matches those two explanations in reverse order. Regarding the first explanation, the Lotus Commentary text explains the words "all sentient beings" based on a portion. The Great Master's explanation elsewhere follows the latter explanation's meaning. Master Jingxing's objection seems not to permit the sutra-promoting commentary's text. Though the latter explanation's principle nature is broad, it also includes active Buddha-nature, granting this prediction to those types who should practice the bodhisattva path, so there's no fault. Therefore the Profound Praise states: "If one practices the bodhisattva path, arousing cultivation, [possessing] reward-body tathāgatagarbha, one shall attain Buddhahood." Thus there's no fault.

Question: Is Bodhisattva Never Disparaging's prediction "you shall attain Buddhahood" limited to those with inherent nature, or how should this be understood?

There are problems on both sides. If it doesn't extend [universally], looking at the sutra text: "All whom he saw... all were bowed to and praised with these words," etc. Since it doesn't discriminate between superior and inferior but universally grants predictions, even if [someone were] without nature, if there were one who saw, [such a one] should definitely receive prediction. Moreover, Never Disparaging was a bodhisattva at the ordinary stage. He had not yet thoroughly understood others' Buddha-nature. How could he distinguish between having and not having nature, with differences between receiving and not receiving predictions? If following this it extends [universally], since this is false prediction-granting, how could there be no fault? Moreover, all the predicted four assemblies reached non-retrogression. They were definitely not the natureless type. How so?

Reconciling explanation: Though this matter is difficult to fathom, it is probably limited to those with nature. How do we know? The Profound Praise's explanation of complete cause prediction mentions bodhisattvas and those seeking solitary awakening, but doesn't speak of predicting the natureless. Bodhisattvas' arousal of intention and those seeking solitary awakening's faith and understanding accomplish non-ignorance of Dharma. Bodhisattva Never Disparaging's granting predictions was for these two matters. However, the objection that those bowed to had no discrimination and should extend to the natureless is indeed reasonable. But looking at the sutra text: "Whether bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī... all were bowed to and praised." The four assemblies of bhikṣus, etc., are all disciples of this Buddha. Even if similar, they are people who took refuge in Buddha and received precepts. If so, he only bowed to Buddha's disciples, not bowing to other non-Buddhists, brahmins, and ordinary men and women. How much less to ghosts and animals? We know he didn't bow to everyone. Having already entered the Buddha path, these were ultimately people who should escape birth and death. If like other schools, all sentient beings truly all become Buddhas, and therefore one bows to them, why limit it to the four groups of

disciples? One should also bow to birds and beasts. Regarding natureless sentient beings arousing intention and practicing, though our school extends to different explanations, the four assembly disciples in Powerful Sound King Buddha's semblance Dharma period properly encountered bodhisattvas of the four wholesome roots, respectfully participated in bowing, properly heard predictions, and though becoming adverse conditions, all achieved liberation. We know Never Disparaging's prediction-granting doesn't extend to the natureless.

Question: Even Tang Tripiṭaka still had doubts about whether his own self had nature or not. How much more so for the arrogantly proud four assemblies who slandered Never Disparaging - why must they not be natureless?

Answer: Tripiṭaka Master was a transformation of Bodhisattva Sadāprarudita. Regarding his manifestation aspects, he was still troubled by feminine attraction for five hundred lifetimes, and within China for nine lifetimes since, he was foremost in merit and wisdom. When receiving and conferring bodhisattva precepts at Master Śīlabhadra's place, the master asked: "Are you a bodhisattva?" After answering "bodhisattva," he then conferred them. Being a bodhisattva means having faith in the meaning of possessing Buddha-nature in one's body. How could one initially give rise to doubts about ultimate naturelessness? We should understand that resolving doubts in Śākya's land was only to remove the arrogant minds of the final age.

Question: If according to this principle, Tripiṭaka should not doubt his own mind's Buddha-nature at all. We should understand that among the world's sentient beings, he doubted whether a portion of natureless types exist. This is somewhat discriminating against other schools. For our school, how could there be no great harm?

The sutra states:

The Profound Praise states: "I deeply respect you and do not disparage" because of possessing Buddha's inherent abiding seed-nature. This

[Left Lower Section]
respects the reward-body tathāgatagarbha. "All practice the bodhisattva path and shall attain Buddhahood" means those with seed-nature, if arousing habitual nature and generating intention to practice, will definitely attain Buddhahood. Also, depending on Dharma-body tathāgatagarbha, all have "I deeply respect you." If practicing the bodhisattva path, arousing and cultivating the reward-body tathāgatagarbha, one shall attain Buddhahood.

I now say: Though the two explanations differ, what is properly predicted are all those who possess reward-body Buddha-nature - people who arouse intention and practice can achieve Buddhahood. Among these, the first explanation takes active Buddha-nature as what is respected; the latter explanation takes principle Buddha-nature as what is respected. Following the first explanation, since the four assembly groups he faced were broad, though Bodhisattva Never Disparaging found it difficult to know their nature, if they possessed active Buddha-nature, all would practice the bodhisattva path and achieve Buddhahood. Following the latter explanation, since principle nature is universal, all the four assemblies he saw should possess it. Though there's no doubt about what is respected, since actual Buddhahood is difficult to determine, if these people also possessed active Buddha-nature and practiced the bodhisattva path, they would attain Buddhahood.

Question: If according to our school's explanation, wouldn't Never Disparaging's blind predictions be false? We should understand that because that bodhisattva definitely believed in the principle that all sentient beings achieve Buddhahood, he universally granted this prediction to all people. If so, other schools' intention accords with this prediction-granting. Making two explanations of principle nature and active nature based on texts like the Nirvana Sutra still strongly doesn't contradict Buddha's general teaching. Not contradicting Buddha's general teaching is because it doesn't point to individual persons. Regarding Never Disparaging, each time he faced one person, he properly predicted "all shall become Buddha." If there should be types who don't achieve Buddhahood, false prediction-granting - wouldn't this be sinful karma?

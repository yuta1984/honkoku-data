The reconciling explanation should follow the pattern of the above topic.

Question: When Bodhisattva Never Disparaging made prostrations saying "you shall become Buddhas," was he predicting the active Buddha-nature, or what? Answer: There are two explanations. The first says active Buddha-nature, the second says principle Buddha-nature. Both are unclear. First, regarding the initial explanation, the Lotus Commentary states that Bodhisattva Never Disparaging's predictions show that all sentient beings have Buddha-nature. If it were active Buddha-nature, how could one say "all sentient beings have Buddha-nature"? Based on this, Master Jingxing says this explanation contradicts the commentary's "complete causes prediction." Moreover, the great master states elsewhere that complete causes predictions extend to those of fixed two-vehicle nature. We should understand this as principle Buddha-nature. The latter explanation is also unclear. Since it already says "all practice the bodhisattva path and shall attain Buddhahood," we know it is not principle Buddha-nature.

Reconciling explanation: The passage "you all practice the bodhisattva path" accords with active Buddha-nature, hence the first explanation. Since it doesn't discriminate among spiritual capacities and gives predictions universally, this seems broad, so the second explanation is established. The Buddha-Ground Commentary reconciles the Nirvana Sutra with two meanings. First it says "regarding the true-suchness Dharma-body Buddha-nature," then "accomplishing a portion of all existing natures." The present Profound Praise reverses the order in matching those two explanations. Regarding the first explanation, the Lotus Commentary text explains the words "all universally" based on "a portion." The great master's explanation elsewhere reflects the latter explanation's meaning. Master Jingxing's objection seems not to accept the commentary text of sutra propagation. Though the latter explanation's principle nature is broad, it also includes active Buddha-nature and gives this prediction to those types who should practice the bodhisattva path, so there is no fault. Therefore the Profound Praise states: "If one practices the bodhisattva path, arouses and cultivates the reward-body Tathāgata-garbha, one shall attain Buddhahood." Thus there is no fault.

Question: Is Bodhisattva Never Disparaging's prediction "you shall attain Buddhahood" limited to those with spiritual potential, or not?

There are difficulties on both sides. If it doesn't extend [to all], looking at the sutra text: "Whoever he encountered... he would prostrate to them all, praise them, and speak these words," etc. Since it doesn't discriminate between superior and inferior, universally giving predictions, even if some lack spiritual nature, if there are those who see, they must receive predictions. Moreover, Never Disparaging was a bodhisattva of ordinary stage who had not yet understood others' Buddha-nature in detail. How could he distinguish between having and lacking spiritual nature, with differences in giving and not giving predictions? If following this and extending [to all], this would be false prediction-giving. How could there be no fault? Moreover, the four assemblies who received predictions all reached non-retrogression. They are definitely not types lacking spiritual nature. How is this?

Reconciling explanation: Though this matter is difficult to fathom, it is probably limited to those with spiritual nature. How do we know this? The Profound Praise's explanation of complete causes predictions mentions bodhisattvas and those seeking solitary enlightenment but doesn't say it predicts those lacking spiritual nature. Bodhisattvas' aspiration and solitary practitioners' faith and understanding constitute not being ignorant of the Dharma. Bodhisattva Never Disparaging gave predictions for these two reasons. However, the objection that his prostrations had no discrimination and should extend to those lacking spiritual nature is indeed reasonable. But looking at the sutra text: "Whether bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī... he prostrated to and praised them all." The four assemblies of bhikṣus, etc., are all disciples of this Buddha. Even if seemingly, they are people who took refuge in Buddha and received precepts. If so, he only prostrated to Buddha's disciples, not to other non-Buddhists, brahmins, ordinary men and women, etc. How much less to spirits, animals, etc.? Thus we know he didn't prostrate to everyone. Since they had already entered the Buddha path, they were people who would eventually escape birth and death. If, like other schools, since all sentient beings truly become Buddhas and he prostrated to them, why limit it to the four groups of

disciples? He should also prostrate to birds and beasts. Regarding sentient beings lacking spiritual nature developing aspiration and practicing, though our school has different explanations, the four groups of disciples in Powerful Sound King Buddha's semblance Dharma period properly encountered a bodhisattva of the four roots of goodness, respectfully participated in prostrations, properly heard predictions, and though serving as adverse conditions, all achieved liberation. We should understand that Never Disparaging's predictions don't extend to those lacking spiritual nature.

Question: Even Tripiṭaka Master [Xuanzang] had doubts about whether his own spiritual nature existed or not. How much more so for the arrogant four assemblies who disparaged Never Disparaging - why must they not lack spiritual nature?

Answer: Tripiṭaka Master was a transformation body of Sadāprarudita Bodhisattva. Regarding his manifestation aspect, for five hundred lifetimes he still had difficulty avoiding feminine attraction, and within China for nine lifetimes he was foremost in merit and wisdom. When receiving bodhisattva precepts from Śīlabhadra and being given bodhisattva precepts, the master asked: "Are you a bodhisattva?" After answering "bodhisattva," he was then given them. Being a bodhisattva means believing in the meaning of having Buddha-nature in one's body. How could he initially generate doubts about ultimately lacking spiritual nature? We should understand that resolving doubts in Śākya's land was only to remove the arrogant minds of the final age.

Question: If according to this principle, Tripiṭaka should not doubt his own mind's Buddha-nature at all. We should understand that among the world's sentient beings, he doubted whether some portion lacks spiritual nature or not. This somewhat discriminates against other schools. For our school, how could there be no great harm?

The sutra states:

The Profound Praise states: "I deeply respect you all and do not disparage you" because there is Buddha's inherent nature spiritual potential. This

[Left Lower Section]
respects the reward-body Tathāgata-garbha. "All practice the bodhisattva path and shall attain Buddhahood" means those with spiritual nature, if they arouse habituated nature, develop aspiration and practice, will certainly attain Buddhahood. Also, based on Dharma-body Tathāgata-garbha, all have "I deeply respect you." If one practices the bodhisattva path and arouses cultivation of the reward-body Tathāgata-garbha, one shall attain Buddhahood.

Now I say: Though the two explanations differ, what is properly predicted is that all possess reward-body Buddha-nature, and people who develop aspiration and practice can achieve Buddhahood. Among these, the first explanation takes active Buddha-nature as what is respected, the latter explanation takes principle Buddha-nature as what is respected. According to the first explanation, since the four assemblies encountered are numerous, though Bodhisattva Never Disparaging finds their nature difficult to know, if they possess active Buddha-nature, they all practice the bodhisattva path and shall become Buddhas. According to the latter explanation, since principle nature is pervasive, the four assemblies he encountered should all possess it. Though there's no doubt about what is respected, since actual Buddhahood is difficult to determine, if this person also possesses active Buddha-nature and practices the bodhisattva path, he shall attain Buddhahood.

Question: If according to our school's explanation, wouldn't Never Disparaging's blind predictions be false? We should understand that because that bodhisattva definitely believed in the principle that all sentient beings achieve Buddhahood, he gave this prediction to all people universally. If so, according to other schools' meaning, this matches these predictions, and making two explanations of principle nature and active nature regarding passages like the Nirvana Sutra still doesn't strongly contradict Buddha's universal teaching. Since Buddha's universal teaching doesn't point to individual persons, it doesn't contradict. For Never Disparaging, each time he faced one person, he properly predicted "all shall become Buddhas." If there could be types who don't achieve Buddhahood, false prediction-giving - how would this not be karmic transgression?

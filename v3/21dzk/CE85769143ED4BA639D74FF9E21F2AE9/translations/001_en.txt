Commentary on Lotus Sutra Volume 1 (Introductory Chapter, Part 1 - First of Five Fascicles)

Introductory Chapter
Six Gates of Xuanzan Commentary
1. Explain the intention behind the sutra's origin. 2. Clarify the sutra's fundamental doctrine. 3. Interpret how the sutra chapters got their names.
4. Show the arrangement of the sutra chapters. 5. Clarify the sequence of the sutra chapters. 6. Explain the main text of the sutra.

First Gate: Explaining the intention behind the sutra's origin (briefly through five meanings)
1. To respond to causal requests. (Responding to causes has six: practice, vows, seeking, upholding, characteristics, expounding | Responding to requests has three: Śāriputra, Mañjuśrī, Maitreya) 2. To destroy doubts and attachments. (Destroying doubts | Destroying attachments) 3. To manifest predictions and practices. (Manifesting predictions | Manifesting practices) 4. To benefit present and future. (Benefiting the present | Benefiting the future)
5. To reveal time and capacity. (Revealing time | Revealing capacity)

Question: In the Xuanzan commentary, when explaining "practicing causes," the text of the eight profound aspects is cited. Do all eight types serve as evidence for these causes? Neither perspective is clear. If they serve as evidence, the eight profound aspects broadly clarify the merits of both causal and resultant stages. "Practicing causes" refers only to cultivation in the causal stage. Why use the various gates such as the marvelous mind-events as comprehensive evidence for practicing causes? Moreover, the profundity of upholding and reciting is cited as genuine evidence in the fourth "upholding cause."
If one text is used to establish two meanings simultaneously, how would the two causes of practice and upholding not become confused? (One version has "yan" written in small script)
If we follow this interpretation that the eight profundities do not necessarily serve as evidence, then the commentary master opens six causes and cites evidence texts for each separately.

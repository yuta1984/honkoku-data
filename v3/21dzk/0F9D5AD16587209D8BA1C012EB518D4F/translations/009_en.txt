few forms. Second, having internal form-perception and observing many external forms. Third, having no internal form-perception and observing few external forms. Fourth, having no internal form-perception and observing many external forms. Fifth, having no internal form-perception and observing external forms as blue. Sixth, having no internal form-perception and observing external forms as yellow. Seventh, having no internal form-perception and observing external forms as red. Eighth, having no internal form-perception and observing external forms as white. Regarding their essential nature, it is the same as the previous totality bases. Because of their superior objects, they differ from the previous ones. "Eight liberations" refers to the fourth virtue of liberation. First, having internal form and observing external forms. Second, having no form and observing external forms. Third, dwelling completely accomplished in pure liberation. Fourth, entering the base of infinite space. Fifth, entering the base of infinite consciousness. Sixth, entering the base of nothingness. Seventh, entering the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Eighth, entering the liberation of cessation of perception and feeling. The first three have the five aggregates as their nature. The next four have the four aggregates. The eighth has non-associated [mental factors] as its nature. Question: What is the difference between liberations, mastery bases, and totality bases? Answer: Being able to abandon and reject is called "liberation." Being able to overcome objects is called "mastery bases." Being able to expand the objective realm is called "totality bases." "Three wisdoms" refers to the fifth gate of three wisdoms. First, wisdom arising from hearing; second, wisdom arising from thinking; third, wisdom arising from cultivation. Superior wisdom arising from hearing sacred teachings, superior wisdom arising from contemplating correct principles, superior wisdom arising from cultivating meditative absorption can be understood in sequence. "Sixteen truths" refers to the sixth gate of sixteen truths. The truth of suffering has four: suffering, emptiness, impermanence, non-self. The truth of origination has four: cause, origination, arising, condition. The truth of cessation has four: cessation, tranquility, excellence, separation. The truth of path has four: path, suchness, practice, emergence. These arise in the seven preparatory stages before the bhūmis. "Four truths" refers to the seventh gate of four truths contemplation. Contemplating the four truths comprehensively regarding the causes and effects of defilement and purity. This should be understood as above. "Four-three-two-one" refers to

the eighth gate of four-conduct contemplation. Master Fan says: "'Four' means only observing the truth of suffering, specifically contemplating the four principles of impermanence, non-self, suffering, and emptiness. 'Three' means next excluding impermanence and only observing suffering, etc. 'Two' means only observing the two principles of emptiness and non-self. 'One' means only observing the single category of non-self. In this stage of patience, when about to enter seeing and internally realize one principle, namely the suchness revealed by non-self, gradually condensing from sixteen contemplations down to one category. This contemplation gate has thirty contemplations. The twenty categories of truth contemplation and the ten contemplations within the contemplation, each giving rise to patience practices in the three stages of entering, abiding, and exiting, thus forming ninety." Master Ce says: "Speaking of attaining ninety refers to the ninth virtue. Now speaking in terms of the Mahāyāna, it becomes ninety. When initially entering the ten stages of faith, each has nine grades, hence called 'ninety patiences.' Another explanation: the above thirty minds all have the three stages of entering, abiding, and exiting, hence forming ninety patiences. Another explanation: the ten bhūmis of supreme joy, etc., each have three of beginning, abiding, and completion. Within the three, each has three grades, hence called ninety. One explanation: the twenty truth contemplations refer to the sixteen truths and four truths. Also, there are ten contemplations, namely four-three-two-one. The total calculation combines to thirty. All have three grades, hence called ninety."

The sūtra says "all merits are accomplished." The interpretation says: Fourth, generally concluding the merits.

The sūtra says "There were also myriad myriad koṭis of eighteen Brahmā heavens, nine Brahmās, three pure ones, three lights, three [and] five blissful heavens." The interpretation says: Seventh, the assembly of form and desire realm heavens. The text has three distinct parts. First, indicating numbers and distinguishing types; next, separately praising virtues; finally, general conclusion. This is the first part. This sūtra text differs in three versions. One version is as above. Some versions lack the four characters "eighteen Brahmā heavens." Some versions exclude "eighteen Brahmā

heavens" and add the character "Brahmā," namely "three Brahmās, five blissful heavens." Although there are three versions, we follow the first version for now. The first three dhyānas each have three heavens. The fourth dhyāna has nine heavens. Altogether eighteen. Master Zang says: "Myriad times myriad, hence called 'myriad myriad koṭis.'" Master Ce says: "Nine Brahmās refers to the nine heavens of the fourth dhyāna. From top to bottom, explaining separately in sequence: Cloudless Heaven, Merit-born Heaven, Great Fruition Heaven, Unconscious Heaven, Without Affliction Heaven, Without Heat Heaven, Excellent Appearance Heaven, Excellent Vision Heaven, Akaniṣṭha Heaven. 'Three pure ones' refers to the three heavens of the third dhyāna: Lesser Purity Heaven, Infinite Purity Heaven, Universal Purity Heaven. 'Three lights' refers to the three heavens of the second dhyāna: Lesser Light Heaven, Infinite Light Heaven, Utmost Light-Purity Heaven. 'Three [and] five blissful heavens' - the three heavens are the three heavens of the first dhyāna: Brahmā's Retinue Heaven, Brahmā's Ministers Heaven, Great Brahmā Heaven. The five blissful [heavens] are the five blissful heavens. These are the separate realms of the five factors complete with joy and bliss in the first dhyāna: first, applied thought factor; second, sustained thought factor; third, joy factor; fourth, bliss factor; fifth, one-pointed mind factor." Master Fan says: "Five, speaking in terms of different dwelling places, there are five heavens. The Avataṃsaka Sūtra speaks of 'five heavens in the first dhyāna': Brahmā Heaven and Brahmā Body are fruits obtained from inferior causes. Brahmā's Ministers Heaven and Brahmā's Attendant Heaven are both fruits obtained from middling causes. Great Brahmā Heaven is the fruit obtained from superior causes. Speaking of 'joy and bliss': the second concentration has joy but no bliss; the third concentration has bliss but no joy; the first concentration has both joy and bliss together. Analyzing in terms of consciousness: the five consciousnesses have bliss but no joy; within mental consciousness, there are both joy and bliss. Delighting the mind is called joy; delighting the body is called bliss. Some sūtra versions say 'three Brahmā heavens.'"

The sūtra says "heavenly concentration, merit concentration flavor, constant bliss, and supernatural powers." The interpretation says: Second, separately praising merits. "Heavenly concentration" refers to

resultant concentration. "Merit concentration" refers to cultivated concentration. "Flavor" refers to flavored concentration, speaking in accordance, not true merit. One explanation attributes it to the above, meaning "merit concentration flavor," referring to loving and being attached to merit concentration. Master Zang says: "Merit concentration is pure concentration. 'Flavor' refers to flavored concentration, because of loving and being attached to concentration. 'Constant bliss and supernatural powers'" - Master Ce says: "Within the four dhyāna concentrations, all have seven supernatural powers, or possibly six supernatural powers."

The sūtra says "merits of eighteen birth-places are all accomplished." The interpretation says: Third, general conclusion. The eighteen Brahmā heavens are the birth-places where various sentient beings are reborn.

The sūtra says "There were also koṭis of koṭis of desire realm heaven princes." The interpretation says: Eighth, the assembly of six desire realm heavens. The text has two distinct parts. First, indicating numbers and distinguishing types; later, separately praising merits. This is the first part. These are: Four Great Kings' Retinue Heaven, Thirty-three Heaven, Yāma Heaven, Tuṣita Heaven, Nirmāṇarati Heaven, Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven.

The sūtra says "ten good karmic results, supernatural powers and merits are all accomplished." The interpretation says: Second, separately praising merits. Because they are in superior places, [these are] what the ten good [actions] bring about. Supernatural powers have two types: resultant and cultivated.

The sūtra says "There were also sixteen great kings, each having from ten thousand, twenty thousand, up to one hundred thousand retainers." The interpretation says: Ninth, clarifying the assembly of sixteen kings. Within this there are two parts. Following the previous pattern, this can be understood. This is the first part.

The sūtra says "five precepts, ten precepts, three refuges - merits and pure faith are complete." The interpretation says: Second, separately praising merits.

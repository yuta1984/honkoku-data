Arousing the observation of the factors of enlightenment, going against the flow of the five views, and gathering immeasurable virtue, therefore it is called the sotāpanna stage. Sotāpanna is translated as "stream-enterer." "Pre" means entering. "Stream" means category. First entering the noble category, therefore called "stream-enterer." Question: The discriminative five views are already severed at the first ground. Why is it said that the five views are first severed upon reaching the fourth ground? Answer: Speaking about reality, this is correct. Now speaking about karmic seeds, calling it "severing the five views" is because they are entirely eliminated by seeing.

The sutra says: "Always penetrating through divine eye, divine ear, knowledge of past lives, knowledge of others' minds, and bodily supernatural powers."

Because outflows are not yet exhausted, it is not a true explanation.

Regarding these four sciences, although they penetrate both inner and outer, now according to one aspect, we provisionally speak of outer speech. Outsiders challenge saying: If Buddha is all-knowing, why does he ask arhats where they came from, etc.? The explanation says: Following worldly customs, he makes these consoling inquiries, not because he doesn't know and therefore asks his disciples. Therefore, the World-Honored One is all-knowing of worldly matters.

The sutra says: "Extinguishing the doubt and other afflictions of the three realms, therefore my characteristics are already exhausted." The interpretation says: The second fearlessness of exhausted outflows.

The sutra says: "Having what does not emerge, therefore called the obstructing path." The interpretation says: The fourth fearlessness of obstructing paths. Outsiders challenge saying: If afflictions obstruct the path, why do stream-enterers, although having love, etc., still have the noble path? Therefore we know that desires, greed and other afflictions cannot obstruct the path. The explanation says: Although not obstructing stream-entry, they can obstruct non-returners, etc.

Therefore it's not that they don't obstruct the path. It's just that obstructions have degrees of severity.

The sutra says: "Contemplating neither existence nor non-existence, one characteristic yet without duality." The interpretation says: Distinguishing the characteristics of contemplation.

The sutra says: "Therefore realizing the anāgāmin stage." The interpretation says: Establishing the fruit. Although severing the afflictions of the three realms, subtle ones still appear before one. Therefore in this context, anāgāmin is established. This is translated as "non-returner." In reality, sixth-ground bodhisattvas are still reborn in the desire realm.

Master Jing says: Aspiring for birthless joy has four grades: first, uninterrupted—because of constant cultivation; second, tranquil—because without distraction; third, firm and密—because not mixed with afflictions; fourth, subtle—because cultivated for long periods. These four have applied effort, therefore delighting in non-effort.

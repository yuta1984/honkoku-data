The sutra says: "Even all Buddhas, the three vehicles, seven worthies, eight saints are also named 'seeing'; the sixty-two views are also named 'seeing'." The interpretation says: From below clarifying that there are transformers. First, depending on right view, proving there are transformers; later, regarding wrong views, proving the meaning of seeing. Speaking of "seven worthies" means the seven expedients etc. Also: first, faith-follower; second, dharma-follower; third, faith-understanding practitioner; fourth, view-attainer; fifth, body-witness; sixth, wisdom-liberated; seventh, both-liberated. Speaking of "eight noble paths" means: first, right view; second, right thinking; third, right speech; fourth, right action; fifth, right livelihood; sixth, right effort; seventh, right mindfulness; eighth, right concentration. Speaking of "sixty-two views" means: four views of complete eternalism, four views of partial eternalism, four views of finitude etc., four views of evasive argumentation, two views of uncausedness, sixteen views of having perception, eight views of non-perception, eight views of neither perception nor non-perception, seven views of annihilationism, five views of nirvana in the present dharma. Details are as in separate chapters.

The sutra says: "Great King, if using names to name and see all dharmas up to all Buddhas, three vehicles, four births, then it is not not-seeing all dharmas." The interpretation says: This depends on nominal designation to prove there are transformers. Having only names, those who see thus are not delusional seeing.

The sutra says: "Addressing the Buddha: 'Prajñāpāramitā has existent dharmas and non-non-dharmas. How does mahāyāna illuminate?'" The interpretation says: From below, through questions and answers, distinguishing contemplative prajñā. "Existent dharmas" are conventional truth objects. "Non-non-dharmas" are ultimate truth objects. Grasping that all dharmas exist is superimposition slander. That all dharmas are non-existent is diminishment slander. Blocking both slanders, repeatedly saying "non-non-dharmas." The question means: does it illuminate like conventional existent dharmas, or illuminate like ultimate truth non-non-dharmas? Or all dharmas are the same as the ultimate, transcending

the four propositions and cutting off the hundred negations—this is object-emptiness. How does it illuminate?

The sutra says: "Great King, mahāyāna sees non-non-dharmas." The interpretation says: From below is the Tathāgata's proper answer. Seeing non-non-dharmas means because of realizing emptiness.

The sutra says: "If dharmas are non-non-dharmas, this is called non-non-dharma emptiness." The interpretation says: Extensively explaining based on emptiness. Namely, if the object dharmas are non-non-dharmas, among the various emptinesses, this is called non-non-dharma emptiness.

The sutra says: "Dharma-nature emptiness, form-sensation-perception-formations-consciousness emptiness, twelve sense-fields emptiness, eighteen elements emptiness, six great elements emptiness, four truths twelve-link dependent origination emptiness." The interpretation says: From below, going through categories to distinguish emptiness, conveniently forming seven levels of emptiness. Speaking of "dharma-nature emptiness" means original nature is inherently empty, not depending on the power of wisdom. Speaking of "twelve sense-fields" means the six sense organs and six sense objects. "Sense-field" means sense-base. Speaking of "eighteen elements" means six sense organs, six sense objects, six consciousnesses. Speaking of "six great elements" means earth, water, fire, wind, space-element, consciousness-element.

The sutra says: "These dharmas are simultaneously born, abiding, ceasing, existing, empty." The interpretation says: From below, second, using the characteristics of birth etc. to explain the meaning of emptiness. First explaining regarding the consciousness aggregate, then explaining the meaning of emptiness regarding the four aggregates and all dharmas. When various consciousnesses arise, they arise from causes and are provisionally called birth. This is included in the formations aggregate.

The sutra says: "Moment by moment it is also thus—dharma-birth, dharma-abiding, dharma-ceasing." The interpretation says: From below, categorical explanation. In Sanskrit it's "kṣaṇa," here called "extremely brief time."

The sutra says: "Why is this so?" The interpretation says: Outsiders question and challenge: birth and cessation are contradictory—how can there be simultaneous birth and cessation? Existence and non-existence are contradictory—how can there be simultaneous existence and emptiness?

The sutra says: "Ninety moments make one thought-moment; within one thought-moment, one moment has nine hundred births and ceasings." The interpretation says: From below the World-Honored One explains and clarifies. Ninety small moments form one great thought-moment. Within one great thought-moment, small moments again have nine hundred births and ceasings. Therefore previously saying "at birth-time there is immediately cessation." Or again, many moments make one thought-moment. Therefore at thought-time, it provisionally exists but is not real. Because it's not real, simultaneous existence and emptiness don't contradict. Also, dividing great thought-time into three parts, one part has thirty, three parts make ninety. Within one great thought-moment are ninety moments; within one moment are nine hundred births and ceasings. If discussing birth and cessation together, there are nine hundred births and ceasings. Discussing separately, there are one thousand eight hundred. One explanation: ninety moments experience eighty-one thousand births and ceasings to form one thought-moment.

The sutra says: "Even form and all dharmas are also thus." The interpretation says: From below, categorically explaining the four aggregates and all dharmas.

The sutra says: "Through prajñāpāramitā emptiness, not seeing conditions, not seeing truths, up to all dharmas being empty." The interpretation says: From below distinguishing how contemplating wisdom illuminates emptiness and existence. Speaking of "not seeing conditions" means not seeing the twelve-link dependent origination. Speaking of "not seeing truths" means not seeing the four truths. "Up to all dharmas being empty" means not seeing the six great dharmas up to the five aggregate dharmas being empty. This should be understood from later to earlier. Being free from discriminative seeing, hence saying "not seeing"—not meaning called "not seeing" because of not realizing.

The sutra says: "Inner emptiness, outer emptiness, inner-outer emptiness, conditioned emptiness, unconditioned emptiness, beginningless emptiness, nature emptiness, ultimate meaning emptiness, prajñāpāramitā emptiness, cause emptiness, Buddha-fruit emptiness, emptiness-emptiness therefore emptiness." The interpretation says: From below distinguishing all

dharma emptiness. There are twelve types. Speaking of "inner emptiness" means the inner six sense-bases like the eye etc. Speaking of "outer emptiness" means the outer six sense-bases like form etc. Speaking of "inner-outer emptiness" means the supporting sense-object dust, first separate then general. Speaking of "conditioned emptiness" means the three realms of desire etc. Speaking of "unconditioned emptiness" means having no birth, abiding, etc. Speaking of "beginningless emptiness" means having no beginning, middle, end. Speaking of "nature emptiness" means the original nature of conditioned and unconditioned. Speaking of "ultimate meaning emptiness" means supreme meaning emptiness. Speaking of "prajñā emptiness" means what realizes emptiness. Speaking of "cause emptiness" means six perfections emptiness. Speaking of "Buddha-fruit emptiness" means bodhi-nirvana emptiness. Speaking of "emptiness-emptiness therefore emptiness" means all dharmas empty—only through emptiness is there emptiness.

The sutra says: "Only because of dharma collection there is existence, because of sensation collection there is existence, because of name collection there is existence." The interpretation says: From below distinguishing its illumination of existence. Speaking of "because of dharma collection there is existence" means this is the perfectly real nature. Speaking of "because of sensation collection there is existence" means this is other-dependent nature. "Because of name collection there is existence" means this is discriminated nature. These three provisional designations should be understood as above.

The sutra says: "Because of cause collection there is existence, because of fruit collection there is existence, because of ten practices there is existence, because of Buddha-fruit there is existence." The interpretation says: This is the four truths approach. Speaking of "because of cause collection there is existence" means this is the truth of accumulation. "Because of fruit collection there is existence" means this is the truth of suffering. "Because of ten practices there is existence" means this is the truth of the path. Because this is the cause of nirvana, from the ten faith stages up to the ten grounds, five types of ten practices are all called the truth of the path: ten faiths, ten understandings, ten practices, ten dedications, ten ground practices as the five types of practices. Speaking of "because of Buddha-fruit there is existence" means bodhi-nirvana—bodhi is one part of the path truth, nirvana is properly included in the cessation truth.

The sutra says: "Up to the six paths, all existence." The interpretation says: This is the conclusion.

accomplishing what the Buddha taught, benefiting beings in accordance with principle. Speaking of "great causal conditions" clarifies teaching prajñā, profoundly exhausting conceptual thought and reaching quiescence—this is the one great matter taught in the Lotus Sutra. Speaking of "scattering flowers" means to clarify loving respect for the Dharma. Speaking of "transforming into jeweled canopies" indicates that in the Buddha's causal practices, though the causes are few, the fruits they invoke are great—like small flowers becoming jeweled canopies. "Covering all the great assembly" represents universal compassionate protection.

The sutra says: "At that time the great king again arose, made obeisance, and addressed the Buddha saying: 'World-Honored One, how do all bodhisattvas protect Buddha fruit, and how do they protect the causal conditions of the ten stage practices?'" The interpretation says: Second, extensive explanation through questions and answers. This is the two questions.

The sutra says: "The Buddha said: 'Bodhisattvas transform the four births.'" The interpretation says: From here below is the Tathāgata's proper teaching. The text has three distinct parts: first the Contemplating Emptiness chapter clarifies self-benefit practices, answering the previous question; next the Teaching and Transformation chapter clarifies other-benefit practices, answering the second question; finally the Two Truths chapter clarifies the principle upon which the two protections depend. Speaking of "four births" means womb-birth, egg-birth, moisture-birth, and transformation-birth.

The sutra says: "Not contemplating the suchness of form, not contemplating the suchness of sensation, perception, formations, and consciousness." The interpretation says: From below, separately explaining the emptiness of transformer and transformed. The text has two distinct parts: first clarifying the two emptinesses of person and phenomena in what is transformed, then clarifying the two emptinesses of person and phenomena in what transforms. Speaking of "not contemplating the suchness of form"—the word "not contemplating" applies throughout the following phrases. Regarding "not contemplating," various explanations differ. One says: when transforming, don't contemplate suchness; when not transforming, contemplate suchness. One says: the grasped-at suchness has nothing to contemplate. One says: form etc. and suchness are all grasping, having nothing to contemplate. One says: the

suchness of form etc. is empty nothingness, hence saying "not what is contemplated"—this is the school of Bhāviveka etc. One says: in reality when bodhisattvas transform sentient beings, they see those five aggregates and that suchness, yet don't discriminate "this is form." Therefore such bodhisattvas function while constantly quiescent, quiescent while constantly functioning. All phenomena should be understood accordingly. Master Tong says: not contemplating form means not grasping at characteristics with marks; not contemplating the suchness of form means not grasping at characteristics without marks.

The sutra says: "Sentient beings, self, person, eternal bliss self purity suchness, knowledge and views, life-span suchness." The interpretation says: This is the personal emptiness of what is transformed. Namely, imputing self upon the five aggregates to make sentient beings. Self, person, etc. exist emotionally but not rationally, hence explained as empty. Or upon the aggregates, imputing self as eternal bliss self purity. Or upon the aggregates, as appropriate, imputing the consciousness aggregate as the knower, a portion of the form aggregate—clarity—as the seer, a portion of the formations aggregate—life etc.—as the liver. These also exist emotionally but not rationally, explained as personal emptiness.

The sutra says: "Bodhisattvas, six perfections, four attractions, all practices suchness, two truths suchness." The interpretation says: From below clarifying the two emptinesses of person and phenomena in what transforms. Speaking of "bodhisattva suchness" is the personal emptiness of what transforms. The grasped-at bodhisattva doesn't exist in principle. "Six perfections etc. suchness" is the phenomenal emptiness of what transforms. The six perfections and other practices that accomplish bodhisattvas don't exist in principle. "Two truths suchness" is the contemplated emptiness.

The sutra says: "Therefore all dharma-nature is truly real emptiness—not coming, not going, unborn, unceasing, same as true limit, equal to dharma-nature, without two, without difference, like space. Therefore aggregates, sense-fields, and elements have the characteristics of no-self and no possession." The interpretation says: Third, concluding the meaning of emptiness. First concluding all dharmas as empty, then concluding the three categories as empty. Master Zang says: all dharma-nature is another name for true characteristics. Truly real emptiness is not the

emptiness understood by the two vehicles. Having nowhere to come from is called "not coming." Having nowhere to go to is called "not going." Yet though dharma-nature has no coming and going, it distinctly comes and goes. Speaking of "unborn, unceasing"—dharmas are originally unborn, so what could cease? Speaking of "same as true limit" means same as the reality-limit of all dharmas. "Equal to dharma-nature" means within all dharmas there is entirely the nature of peace and bliss—this is another name for nirvana. "Without two, without difference"—some say: having no person outside dharmas is called "without two"; having no dharmas outside persons is called "without difference." I think this is incorrect—the four virtues of permanence and bliss have no two and no difference. Speaking of "like space" generally metaphorizes the absence of persons and dharmas. Speaking of "aggregates, sense-fields, elements" means the five aggregates, twelve sense-fields, and eighteen elements.

The sutra says: "This is the bodhisattva practicing transformation of the ten stages, prajñāpāramitā." The interpretation says: Fourth, concluding the essence of protection. "Practicing transformation of the ten stages" concludes the protective causes. "Prajñāpāramitā" concludes the protective fruits.

The sutra says: "Addressing the Buddha: 'If all dharmas are thus, do bodhisattvas transform to protect sentient beings, or transform for the sake of sentient beings?'" The interpretation says: Second, repeated explanation through questions and answers. First questioning, then answering.

The sutra says: "Great King, dharma-nature, form, sensation, perception, formations, consciousness are eternal bliss self purity." The interpretation says: From below, properly answering. The text has two distinct parts: first, depending on the ultimate, not transforming; later, depending on the conventional, able to transform. One explanation: the five aggregates are pre-stage objects, eternal bliss are on-stage objects. The present explanation: the five aggregates are dependent objects, eternal etc. are supporting objects. Such two objects pervade both pre-stage and on-stage.

The sutra says: "Not abiding in form, not abiding in non-form, not abiding in non-non-form." The interpretation says: Second, distinguishing contemplation. The text has two distinct parts: first contemplating the form aggregate, then categorically explaining the four aggregates. However, in explaining this text, various explanations differ. One

says: "not abiding in form" blocks the form aggregate. Form is substantial obstruction. Speaking of "non-form" blocks the four aggregates—namely discriminating mind etc. Speaking of "non-non-form" repeatedly blocks form and mind. The wisdom contemplating that suchness is free from form and non-form. One says: "not abiding"—that inner-realization wisdom doesn't attach. Through the three naturelessnesses, eliminating the three natures of form. One says: dharma-nature suchness transcends the four propositions and cuts off the hundred negations.

The sutra says: "Even sensation, perception, formations, consciousness also neither abide nor non-abide." The interpretation says: Categorically explaining the four aggregates. Speaking of "neither abide nor non-abide"—to preserve brevity, raising the latter to encompass the former.

The sutra says: "Why is this so?" The interpretation says: Questioning and concluding. This has two explanations. One says: true and not-true suchness are all one essence—why separately explain the suchness of various aggregates? One says: since there is ultimate truth, how is there no abiding?

The sutra says: "Non-form suchness, non-non-form suchness." The interpretation says: From below, the explanation also has two interpretations. One explains the previous question saying: non-form suchness is non-non-form suchness. Should explain three propositions: non-form suchness, non-non-form suchness, non-form non-non-form suchness. However, due to brevity, explaining two. One explains the latter question saying: suchness means emptiness, namely true nature emptiness. Having nowhere to abide, hence saying "not abiding."

The sutra says: "Because of conventional truth, because of three provisional designations, named as seeing sentient beings, because all birth-natures are real." The interpretation says: From below, second, depending on the conventional, able to transform sentient beings. Having two conditions, therefore seeing what is transformed. Speaking of "because of conventional truth"—becoming form truth, mind truth, emptiness truth. Speaking of "three provisional designations" means dharma provisional designation etc. Speaking of "named as seeing sentient beings" means depending on two causes, therefore having persons to be transformed. Speaking of "because birth-natures are real" repeatedly presents the cause. Depending within conventional truth, all four births also have real nature. Some texts say: because all dharma-natures are real.

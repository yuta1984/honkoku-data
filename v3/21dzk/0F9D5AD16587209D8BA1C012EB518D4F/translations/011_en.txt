This is the name of a tree. The four sons ruled under the Śākya tree. They established the name from the tree. Hence it is called Śākya. Therefore, though the original surname was called Gautama, now the original surname is changed and called Śākyamuni. "Gautama" is a corruption. The correct pronunciation is Gautama. This translates as "sugarcane lineage." Some call it "solar deity lineage," some call it "clay lineage," or some call it "cow dung lineage." This is from the beginning of the kalpa. There was a Caṇḍāla king and others who killed all the Śākya clan members, and they were all completely exterminated. At that time there was a sage in the deep mountains who had cultivated and attained the divine eye. Seeing the Śākya clan being executed, when they were about to be completely exterminated, intending to preserve the Śākya lineage, he managed to hide one Śākya son. He planned to have him succeed to the throne. At that time, that Caṇḍāla king sent astronomers to divine this. Knowing that the Śākya clan was not completely extinct, they entered the mountains to search and seek. The sage was not there, and they took the boy away. They used literature to replace governance. At the time of facing death, the sage, seeing that rescue was impossible, then in the sky preached the Dharma for him. He created a beautiful woman to cause worldly desire to arise. Thus there was a bodily emission that was left on the ground. The sage took it and placed it in cow dung, putting it in a sugarcane garden. After several days were complete, within the cow dung, twin boys were born through transformation. Thus the Śākya lineage was continued. The present Śākya lineage all comes from this birth. If those who praise with good hearts say this is the solar deity lineage, or call it the sugarcane lineage. If those who slander with evil hearts say this is the clay lineage, or the cow dung lineage.

The sūtra says: "On the eighth day of the first month of the first year." The interpretation says: Second, the time period of manifesting auspicious signs. Twenty-nine years after the Buddha's enlightenment, he taught other Prajñāpāramitā texts, and at the beginning of the thirtieth year, on the eighth day of the first month, he taught this sūtra. The original record says: "On the eighth day of the first month of the first year, seven years after enlightenment he taught the Prajñāpāramitā." Examining this sūtra text, thirty-six years after enlightenment, this sūtra should be taught. Master Zang says: "The Buddha achieved enlightenment, and thirty-six years later, on the eighth day of the first month, he taught this sūtra. Seven years after the Buddha's enlightenment, he first taught other Prajñāpāramitā." Examining what this text says, twenty-nine years, reaching the present time, should be thirty-six years after enlightenment before teaching this sūtra. Master Tong says: "In the thirtieth year after enlightenment, on the eighth day of the first month, he first taught this sūtra."

The sūtra says: "Properly seated in the ten stages." The interpretation says: Third, properly abiding in the ten stages. "Properly" means correctly. The Buddha, wanting to manifest auspicious signs, correctly abides in the ten stages. However, these ten stages have two interpretations. First, the ten stages of Supreme Joy and others; second, the Tathāgata's ten stages. The evidence is that the Contract Sūtra and the Sūtra of the Same Nature are the same original text with different translations. The Mahāyāna Sūtra of the Same Nature says: "First, the stage of profound, difficult-to-know, luminous wisdom virtue (eliminating subtle habitual tendencies, attaining freedom); second, the stage of pure bodily parts magnificently adorned inconceivable bright virtue (turning the wheel of true Dharma, revealing profound meaning); third, the stage of good bright banner jeweled characteristics ocean treasury (teaching śrāvaka precepts, revealing the three vehicles); fourth, the stage of explained wonderful golden light merit supernatural knowledge virtue (teaching eighty thousand dharmas, subduing the four māras); fifth, the stage of great wheel majesty treasury bright virtue (destroying heterodox teachings, subduing evil conduct); sixth, the stage of space-like inner pure stainless flame light opening characteristics (manifesting the six supernatural powers' limitless affairs); seventh, the stage of vastly victorious dharmadhātu treasury bright realm (for bodhisattvas revealing bodhi); eighth, the supremely victorious universally awakened wisdom ocean treasury capable of pure stainless pervading unobstructed wisdom penetration (for bodhisattvas giving prophecies); ninth, the stage of limitless koṭis of adornments dedicated capable of illumination (for bodhisattvas manifesting skillful means); tenth, the Vairocana wisdom ocean treasury stage (for bodhisattvas teaching all dharmas)." Though there are two explanations, the original record's intention focuses on the bodhisattva ten stages. Master Fan says it focuses on the Buddha's ten stages. Master Zang is likewise.

The sūtra says: "Entering the Great Silent Chamber samādhi." The interpretation says: "Entering the Great Silent Chamber" and saying "samādhi" is an abbreviated corruption.

It should be called samāpatti. This is called "equal maintenance." Because it leaves behind sinking and agitation, it is called "equal." Maintaining mind and mental factors, causing them to abide in one object, hence called "maintenance." This applies to meditative concentration, scattered states, with mind and without mind. That is, among the specific mental factors, concentration is the essence. There are two interpretations. One says: Suchness and emptiness nature is what stopping and insight depend on, called the Great Silent Chamber. Getting the name from the object, hence called Great Silent Chamber Samādhi. This is a dependent interpretation. One says: Concentration being extremely tranquil is what wisdom depends on, called Great Silent Chamber Samādhi. This is a karmadhāraya compound. Master Zang says: "When the Tathāgata teaches Dharma, first requiring entering concentration is to observe faculties and examine principles. This is why one enters concentration. Wanting to clarify that the Tathāgata is silent yet constantly functioning, functioning yet constantly silent. How could there be distinctions of entering and exiting? From the eighth stage upward, there is no entering or exiting concentration. How could the Tathāgata have entering and arising from concentration? But this demonstrates proper conduct for worldly people. When the Tathāgata teaches Prajñāpāramitā, he still enters concentration for contemplation. How much more would other people speak without contemplation?"

The sūtra says: "Contemplatively causing light to shine, illuminating beings of the three realms" (some versions say "illuminating within the three realms"). The interpretation says: Fifth, contemplatively causing auspicious manifestation. This means the present World-Honored One contemplatively causes light to be emitted, illuminating within the three realms. Another interpretation: "contemplatively causing" belongs to the previous clause. Question: The two realms have form and should be what is illuminated. Within the formless realm there is completely no form. Why does it speak of illuminating the three realms? Answer: The Intermediate State Sūtra says when the Tathāgata reaches the formless realm, formless beings wisely understand the World-Honored One. Also, the Original Karma Sūtra says: "In the Tathāgata's Dharma teaching assembly, formless heavenly beings come to enter the assembly." Therefore we know the formless realm possesses both illuminator and illuminated. Also, the sūtra below says: "Jeweled flowers reach up to the Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception Heaven." At that time, immeasurable fragrant flowers of the formless realm descended like clouds. The interpretation says: This speaks according to dharma-sphere form, not form-sphere. Master Zang says: "Contemplatively causing refers to the great teaching's dependent origination. Great wisdom clearly perceives, hence

called contemplatively causing." Another interpretation: Wanting to teach Prajñāpāramitā, contemplating signless meaning, conditions on dharma-nature principle. Master Jing says: "Observing the faculties of beings, hence called contemplatively causing."

The sūtra says: "Furthermore, from the crown emerged a thousand jeweled lotus flowers, the flowers reaching up to the Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception Heaven, and likewise extending to other directions' Ganges sand buddha-lands." The interpretation says: Second, flowers growing from the crown. Question: Above clarifying light emission, afterward clarifying flower generation. What is the significance of this? Answer: According to the original record: "The intention of emitting light reveals cutting off beings' ignorance. The intention of producing flowers reveals cultivating causes and attaining results. Like flowers revealing fruit." Master Zang says: "Some people say that although the formless realm lacks coarse form, it has subtle form. The present interpretation is not so. The characteristics of form and formlessness are neither form nor non-form. Hence called the formless realm. The formless heavenly beings, having heard the Prajñāpāramitā, rejoice." Master Fan says: "These manifested flowers are composed of a thousand jewels. Beings with karmic connections in the three realms see the light. Those without connections, though near, do not see."

The sūtra says: "At that time, from the formless realm rained down immeasurable transforming great fragrant flowers, like wheel flowers, like Mount Sumeru king, descending like clouds." The interpretation says: Third, clarifying the heavenly beings raining flowers. First clarifying the formless realm raining flowers, next clarifying form realm flowers, finally clarifying desire realm flowers. This is the first.

The sūtra says: "Eighteen Brahmā heaven kings rained down hundreds of transforming different-colored flowers." The interpretation says: This clarifies formless flowers.

The sūtra says: "The six desire realm heavens rained down immeasurable colored flowers." The interpretation says: This clarifies desire realm flowers.

The sūtra says: "Before the Buddha's seat naturally grew nine hundred koṭis of kalpa flowers reaching up to the Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception Heaven." The interpretation says: This is the fourth, self-generating flowers. Due to the Buddha's awesome power, kalpa means layered kalpa.

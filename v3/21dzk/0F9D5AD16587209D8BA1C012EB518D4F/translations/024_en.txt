There are two types. First is internal impurity, such as hair, etc. Second is external, such as bluish putrefaction, etc. Second is mutual affliction. Third is inferiority. Fourth is dependence [relativity]. Fifth is afflictions. Sixth is rapid decay. Based on this, it explains that the concentrations of the form and formless realms are also impure.

The sutra says: "Dwelling in the Buddha's family." The interpretation says: Emptiness and no-self are where the Buddha dwells, called the Buddha's family. Being in the habit-nature, first realizing the principle of emptiness, it is therefore called "dwelling."

The sutra says: "Cultivating the six harmonious respectful practices—namely, the three karmas are the same, precepts are the same, views are the same, learning is the same, practicing the eighty-four thousand pāramitā paths." The interpretation says: Because one dwells in the Buddha's family, one cultivates the six harmonies.

The sutra says: "Good men, before practicing patience, bodhisattvas who practice the ten wholesome [actions] have regression and progression." The interpretation says: Raising the inferior to reveal the superior. "Before practicing patience" refers to the ten faith stages. These have progression and regression.

The sutra says: "Like light feathers following the wind east and west." The interpretation says: Raising an analogy. This can be understood.

The sutra says: "These various bodhisattvas are also like this." The interpretation says: Matching the analogy.

The sutra says: "Although practicing the ten right paths for ten thousand eons and arousing the three bodhi minds, they should enter the stage of practicing patience and should study the three dharmas of subduing patience, yet they cannot be characterized and are called unstable people." The interpretation says: Second, explaining and resolving the subduing difficulty. First, practicing for ten thousand eons; second, arousing mind and learning; third, patience—therefore logically they should not regress.

The sutra says: "These stable people enter the stage of personal emptiness because of their sage nature." The interpretation says: Revealing their superior stage—namely the ten dwelling stages. Because they realize the principle of personal emptiness, it is called attaining sage nature and is non-retrogressing.

The sutra says: "They certainly do not commit the five grave offenses, six heavy [transgressions], twenty-eight light [transgressions], create rebellious crimes against the Buddha-dharma scriptures, or say they are not the Buddha's teaching—there is no such case."

【Right page, lower section】
The interpretation says: Being free from faults has four aspects. First, not committing the five grave offenses. Second, not committing the six heavy [transgressions]. The Upāsaka Sutra says: first, killing; second, stealing; third, sexual misconduct; fourth, false speech; fifth, selling liquor; sixth, slanderous speech. Other sutras explain four heavy [transgressions]. Third, not committing the twenty-eight light [transgressions]. The Upāsaka Sutra says: first, not making offerings to parents and teachers; second, indulging in drinking alcohol; third, not caring for the sick; fourth, when someone begs for food, not giving and letting them leave empty-handed; fifth, when seeing monks and others staying overnight, not having the upāsaka perform respectful prostrations and inquiries; sixth, when seeing those who break precepts, generating arrogant minds; seventh, not receiving the eight precepts on the six fasting days each month; eighth, when there is a dharma teaching within forty li, not going to listen; ninth, receiving bedding and seats from the saṅgha; tenth, drinking water suspected of containing insects; eleventh, traveling alone in dangerous places without companions; twelfth, staying alone in nunneries; thirteenth, for the sake of wealth and life, beating and scolding servants, attendants, and outsiders; fourteenth, offering leftover food to the four assemblies; fifteenth, keeping cats; sixteenth, raising elephants, horses, cattle, donkeys, and all birds and beasts without making pure donation for those not yet ordained; seventeenth, storing the three robes, etc.; eighteenth, for the sake of bodily life, deceptively farming without seeking pure water and dry planting areas; nineteenth, for bodily life, engaging in commerce, using false measures and scales to sell goods, abandoning the cheap to take the expensive; twentieth, engaging in sexual desire at improper places and times; twenty-first, in commercial trading, not paying official taxes and stealing away; twenty-second, violating national laws; twenty-third, when obtaining fresh fruits, etc., not first offering to the Three Jewels but using them oneself; twenty-fourth, making [teachings] oneself before the saṅgha has expounded the dharma; twenty-fifth, walking in front of novices

and monks; twenty-sixth, when distributing food in the saṅgha, if partial to the teacher, selecting the best and taking more than one's share; twenty-seventh, those who raise silkworms; twenty-eighth, when traveling and seeing sick people, etc., not staying to personally care for them, arranging for others through expedient means and permanently abandoning them. Fourth, not committing slander of the dharma—namely not slandering the Buddha, and not [saying] that all the various sutras are not spoken by the Buddha.

The sutra says: "Being able to cultivate subduing-path patience for one incalculable eon and first attain entry to the saṅghāta stage." The interpretation says: The time period for entering the stage. "Incalculable eon" means "countless eon"—referring to day-month-year eons, or possibly the three-disaster eons. The saṅghāta stage: according to tradition, it is interpreted as the nature-lineage. Or it is called "freedom from attachment"—meaning realizing personal emptiness and not being attached to self, sentient beings, etc. Through incalculable eon cultivation, one enters the nature-lineage.

The sutra says: "Furthermore, the nature-lineage." The interpretation says: The second nature-lineage, namely the ten practices. This can be understood according to the previous [explanation].

The sutra says: "Practicing the ten wisdom contemplations." The interpretation says: Distinguishing the differences in contemplation.

The sutra says: "Extinguishing the ten inversions." The interpretation says: Clarifying the truth of cessation. The "ten inversions" are: first, permanence; second, pleasure; third, self; fourth, purity; fifth, greed; sixth, hatred; seventh, delusion; eighth, past causes; ninth, future effects; tenth, present cause and effect. Because of firm attachment, they are called "inversions."

The sutra says: "And the self-person views are false part by part, having only names, having only reception, having only dharmas, and are unobtainable." The interpretation says: Knowing conventional existence—namely the three falsities, therefore not truly existent.

The sutra says: "Having no fixed characteristics and no self-other characteristics, therefore cultivating the contemplation of protecting emptiness." The interpretation says: This is stated contemplation. When not yet attained,

【Left page, lower section】
it is called "cultivation"; when already attained, it is called "protection."

The sutra says: "Also always practicing one million pāramitās, never leaving the mind moment by moment." The interpretation says: Because the practiced contemplation gradually becomes superior, practicing the six perfection practices, constantly not separating from the mind.

The sutra says: "Practicing right dharma methods for two incalculable eons and dwelling in the bharāda stage." The interpretation says: The time period for entering the stage. The bharāda stage is translated as "protection." This is the nature-lineage, namely the ten practice stage. The original record says it is the path-lineage, but this is incorrect. It contradicts the sutra's [teaching of] subduing patience and the thirty [people of] sage embryo. Through two incalculable eons of practicing the right path, one attains entry to the ten dedications.

The sutra says: "Furthermore, the path-lineage." The interpretation says: This is the third stage. Because it is the lineage of the holy path above the [bodhisattva] grounds, it is called the path-lineage. The sutra text above says subduing patience advances into the path of equality—this is precisely this stage.

The sutra says: "Dwelling in firm patience, contemplating all dharmas as having no arising, dwelling, or cessation." The interpretation says: Distinguishing contemplation differences. This is the ten firm minds. Contemplating the meaning of emptiness can be understood according to the previous [explanation].

The sutra says: "Namely, the five receptions, three realms, and two truths have no self-other characteristics. Because suchness-nature is unobtainable." The interpretation says: Separately expounding the ten contemplations. "Five receptions" refers to the conditioned five aggregates. Because they are what is grasped by grasping such as greed, they are called "reception." This is dharma-emptiness. This should be understood according to the above.

The sutra says: "And always entering the tenth ultimate truth mind—mind cessation." The interpretation says: Raising the superior to distinguish the inferior. Although practicing the ten patiences, only when practicing the tenth ultimate truth mind can one properly contemplate the cessation of the arising-ceasing scattered and moving mind. "Ultimate truth" is the name of this patience.

"few things." Fourth is "interpreting separately according to circumstances." Regarding causation, as stated in the third fascicle of the *Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra*: "When the Buddha was about to enter nirvana at the sala grove in Kuśinagara, lying with his head to the north and about to first enter nirvana, at that time Ānanda, whose personal affection had not yet been removed and who had not yet left desire, had his mind sunk in an ocean of sorrow and could not extricate himself. At that time, the elder Aniruddha spoke to Ānanda saying: 'You are the one who completely protects the Buddha-dharma treasury. You should not sink yourself in an ocean of sorrow like an ordinary person. All conditioned phenomena are impermanent. Why do you grieve and worry? You should ask the Buddha: After the Buddha's nirvana, how should we practice? Who should become the teacher? How should we dwell together with the foul-mouthed Chanda? What words should be placed at the beginning of the Buddha's sutras?' Ānanda immediately asked the Buddha about these matters. The Buddha told Ānanda: 'Practice by controlling the mind with the four foundations of mindfulness, let the precept-sutras be your teacher, treat Chanda's foul mouth with the pure dharma, and at the beginning of all the Buddha's sutras, proclaim words such as "Thus have I heard."'" Up to the extensive explanation, but I fear verbosity and do not elaborate. According to the *Mahākaruṇā Sūtra*, it was Upāli who taught Ānanda to ask. The reason the sutra and treatise explanations are not the same is that two people taught together, each according to one principle, and they do not contradict each other. Explaining the intention of the matter, there are briefly two types: first, to cut off doubt; second, to generate faith. This is detailed in the regular records. Regarding the number of matters, there are naturally three explanations. First, in Paramārtha's explanation of seven matters, it opens into seven matters: "Thus" indicates the dharma heard; second, saying "I" brings forth the person who heard, namely Ānanda; third, saying "heard" means personally learning the sounds and meaning; fourth, "one time" shows that the dharma heard was well-suited to the timing; fifth, "Buddha World-Honored One" establishes the teacher who can expound; sixth, "dwelling place" shows that the teaching has a location; seventh, "great assembly" shows it was not heard alone. Master Zang says: "Now temporarily relying on the pair of pre-sutra and post-sutra to interpret the two sequences. The two sequences become two distinctions. From the beginning

to 'the great assembly sat properly together' is called the post-sutra sequence. When the Buddha was in the world, this sequence did not yet exist. When about to enter nirvana, he instructed Ānanda saying: 'After my extinction, when bringing forth the dharma treasury, you should do such things as these.' Therefore it is called the post-Buddha sequence. Second, from 'At that time, the Ten Epithets' onward clarifies the sequence for the time of teaching the sutra. When about to teach the sutra, it opens and develops through circumstances. Now we first clarify the post-Buddha sequence, up to the extensive explanation. This is temporary nominal distinction within the nameless and characterless, and should not be taken as definitive for argument." Master Ce says: "Second, according to the *Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra*, it opens into six matters: first, faith; second, hearing; third, time; fourth, master; fifth, place; sixth, assembly. Vasubandhu's *Pradīpa* treatise also explains six matters. Therefore it says: 'The first three clarify the disciple; the latter three attest to the teacher's teaching. All sūtra dharma-gates are like this.' Third, according to the *Buddha-bhūmi-śāstra*, it is gathered into five matters: first, generally showing what was heard; second, the time period of arising; third, separately showing the teaching master; fourth, showing the place where the teaching arose; fifth, the capacity to which the teaching was directed. Interpreting separately according to circumstances: although the various explanations are not the same, we temporarily rely on the five matters to interpret this sutra. The similarities and differences among them will be distinguished when we reach the text. Saying 'Thus have I heard' is precisely the first—generally showing what was heard. The interpretation has three meanings: first, general interpretation of 'Thus have I heard'; second, separate interpretation of 'Thus have I heard'; third, expressing the intention of those who combined the explanation. 'General interpretation' means that those who transmitted the Buddha's teaching—Mañjuśrī, Ānanda, and others—all made this statement: 'Such profound phrases and meanings as were explained, I personally encountered and heard.' 'Separate interpretation' means first interpreting 'thus' and then explaining 'I heard.' Regarding 'thus,' the various masters of this land have many interpretations according to what they possess. Now I shall briefly述 the explanations of the Western Tripiṭaka masters and various teachers. The Western Tripiṭaka masters have briefly three explanations. First, Paramārtha says: 'Saying "thus" has the meaning of certainty, and there are two types: first,

【Left page, upper section】
text; second, principle. Text is what expresses; principle is precisely what is expressed. What Ānanda transmitted was certain in text and principle, just as the Buddha explained. Therefore it is called 'thus.'" Second, the Long-Ears Tripiṭaka master's interpretation has three meanings: "First, translating in terms of the Buddha: what all Buddhas of the three periods explained has no difference, therefore it is called 'like.' Because of the same explanation, it is called 'this.' Second, understanding according to dharma: because of the true characteristic of all dharmas, it is called 'like.' Speaking as it truly is, therefore it is called 'this.' Third, distinguishing according to the Sangha: what Ānanda transmitted was not different from what the Buddha said, therefore it is called 'like.' Permanently separated from faults and errors, it is called 'this.'" Third, Bodhiruci briefly has four dhyānas: "First, arousing the mind thus; second, teaching others thus; third, analogies thus; fourth, certainty thus. 'I thus saw and heard' etc." The present 'thus' only takes the fourth 'certainty thus.' The dharma transmitter says: "The teaching principles I heard from the Buddha were neither too much nor too little, neither wrong nor erroneous, definitely thus, transmitted without error." Therefore it is called 'thus.' Up to the extensive explanation. Separately interpreting 'I heard' means first interpreting the characteristic of 'I' and then explaining 'hearing.' What is called 'I' refers to the dharma transmitters—Mañjuśrī, Ānanda, and others—provisionally established as 'I' based on the body of the five aggregates. The ear faculty generates consciousness and listens to what is explained, which is called 'hearing.' Therefore the *Buddha-bhūmi-śāstra* says: "'I' refers to the conventional provisional designation of the aggregates. 'Hearing' refers to the ear faculty generating consciousness and listening and receiving. Setting aside the particular for the general, therefore it says 'I heard.'"

The sutra says "one time." The interpretation says: Second is the time period of the teaching's arising. According to the *Buddha-bhūmi-śāstra*, there are three kinds of time: First, the completion of speaking and listening is generally called "one time." Second, the one who can speak attains dhāraṇī and explains all dharmas within one syllable; the one who can listen attains pure divine ear and in one moment, one syllable's time, all without obstruction, can completely receive and understand. Therefore it is called "one time." Third, the capable and the receiving encounter each other, with no distinction in time period.

Therefore it is called "one time." The capable transformer and those to be transformed meet together. Question: What is the essence of "one" and "time"? Answer: "One" is a numerical dharma; "time" is precisely a time period. In the Nāgārjuna school, having no essence permanently, it is not included in the three categories. In the Maitreya school, it is a provisional designation of positions on conditioned dharmas, included in non-associated [formations].

The sutra says "Buddha." The interpretation says: Third, separately showing the teaching master. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra* says: "Those who expound Buddha-dharma are of five types: first, the Buddha's own explanation; second, disciples' explanation; third, ṛṣis' explanation; fourth, gods' explanation; fifth, transformation beings' explanation. To distinguish from the other four, therefore 'Buddha's explanation' is indicated." However, at the beginning of various sutras, the way names are indicated is not the same, and there are indeed four types: Some sutras initially place only the Buddha's name, like the *Nirvāṇa* [Sutra] etc. Some sutras initially have only "Bhagavat," like the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* etc. Some sutras initially indicate both epithets together, like the *Anuttarāśraya* etc. Some sutra texts have neither epithet, like the *Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya* etc. The reason it is thus—that the various versions differ—is that the *Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya* etc. were separately recorded and circulated within one collection, therefore no name is indicated. Regarding the other three phrases, there are three Western explanations. First, according to the *Satyasiddhi* treatise: "At the beginning of all sutras, only 'Buddha' should be stated." Therefore that treatise says: "Question: Among the sutra of the great teacher's ten epithets, why are the other nine not listed but only 'Buddha' is proclaimed? Answer: Because there are ten meanings: first, awakening superior to the divine realm; second, not arising through others; third, separated from the two ignorances; fourth, having transcended sleep; fifth, like a lotus; sixth, self-nature without defilement; seventh, possessing the three meanings; eighth, possessing the three virtues; ninth, possessing the three jewel-natures; tenth, knowing oneself and causing others to know. The other names are not thus. The six meanings of Bhagavat are as usual." Master Fan says: "Buddha—this applies to both what expresses and what is expressed. First clarifying what expresses, then distinguishing what is expressed. The Western 'Buddha' contains many meanings. Like the *Mahāyānasaṃgraha*, according to

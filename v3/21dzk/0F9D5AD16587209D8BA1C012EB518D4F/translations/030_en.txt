The sun appears. Nine: solar eclipse. Ten: single ring. Eleven: double ring. Twelve: triple ring. Thirteen: quadruple ring. Fourteen: quintuple ring. Such fourteen-fold disasters are all manifestations of famine, warfare, epidemic, etc. Regarding the second stellar disaster: "Twenty-eight" means there are seven in each of the four directions, totaling twenty-eight. "Losing course" means actions do not follow the constant path, hence called "losing course." "Venus" refers to the Great White Star. Foreign countries call it the Celestial Teacher Star. If it moves according to principle, there is abundance; if it loses course, there is danger. "Comet star" refers to the Yama King Star of foreign countries. This Yama King Star, wherever it appears, necessarily brings disasters. The wheel star has radiance like a wheel. If the sun, moon, and five planets are in the center of that wheel star, then the land becomes divided. If the sun, moon, and five planets move to the right of the wheel star, then the land is peaceful. Moving left is also not good. "Ghost star" means in the ninth month, at sunset it moves in the northeast. If this passes the proper season, if it approaches above, then ghosts and spirits come to destroy the country and sicken people. "Fire star" refers to the Mars (Antares). This governs bandits. If it is high, bandits arise; if low, bandits hide. If in the rat position, it is low; if at noon, it is high. "Water star" is the moisture star, also the white star. If in the tiger position, it is low; if in the monkey position, it is high. It moves thirty days per position, completing one cycle in twelve months. Moving from rooster-dog-pig-rat positions brings no water. Moving from rabbit-snake-sheep-monkey positions brings much water. Moving from ox-tiger-dragon-horse positions brings moderate water—neither much nor little. "Wind star" refers to the Pleiades. When in the tiger position, it is high. It moves thirty days per position. When moving through the monkey position, it descends. If high, there is much wind and no rain. If low, there is much rain and little wind.

High in the seventh month, low in the first month. From the eighth month to the first month, it gradually descends; from the second month to the seventh month, it gradually rises. Following the sun's movement, there are three types. The second, third, eighth, and ninth months move together with the sun. The tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and first months—these four months move ahead of the sun. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh months—these four months move behind the sun. This is moving according to dharma. Differing from this means losing course and is not good. "Sword star" is also the full star. To move through one position takes two and a half years. If in the rabbit position, it is highest; if in the rooster position, it is lowest. If high, there are many weapons, sentient beings suffer famine and disease; if low, there are few weapons. "Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper" are not constellations but luminaries. "Five regulatory great stars" refers to metal, wood, water, earth, and fire as their essence. Regarding all sovereign stars, three ministers stars, and hundred officials stars: if auspicious stars enter these four star positions, there is great peace, stability, and abundance; if inauspicious stars enter, there is great suffering. Following the movement of various constellations, not depending on the constant path, hence called "each transforming and appearing." If great kings and ministers govern people contrary to the Way, indulgent and unrestrained, as painful retribution is about to arise, then sun and moon wax and wane abnormally, stellar paths lose their course, manifesting inauspiciousness and raising various difficulties.

The sutra says: "Great fires burn the country, burning up all people, or ghost fire, dragon fire, heavenly fire, mountain spirit fire, human fire, tree fire, bandit fire—when such strange transformations occur, reading and expounding this sutra constitutes the third difficulty." The interpretation says: The third fire burning disaster. There are seven types of fire. Ghosts become angry and emit fire, causing fever, hence called "ghost fire." Dragons rain poisonous fire, causing people swelling disease, called "dragon fire." Thunder and lightning come from heaven emitting fire, hence called "heavenly fire." Immortals become angry and recite incantations, making ghosts and spirits burn people, hence called "mountain spirit fire." Tree fire

means heaven emits fire stars, able to stop rain, so sunlight greatly blazes, and all trees generate fire. The rest can be understood.

The sutra says: "Great waters flood and submerge people, seasons reverse—winter rain, summer snow, winter thunder and lightning, in the sixth month raining ice, frost, and hail, raining red water, black water, blue water, raining earth, mountain stones, sand and gravel stones, rivers flowing backward, floating mountains and flowing stones—when such transformations occur, reading and expounding this sutra also constitutes the fourth difficulty." The interpretation says: The fourth water disaster. Master Jing says: Raining snow out of season, etc., is not directly epidemic disease, but also prevents grain from ripening. Raining red signifies warfare. Raining black signifies epidemic. Raining blue signifies famine. Rivers flowing backward means seawater overflowing causing reverse flow. This brings external bandits. If flowing backward without cause, it brings internal bandits. "Floating mountains and flowing stones" refers to dragons becoming angry and manifesting.

The sutra says: "Great winds blow and kill, destroying myriad people, lands, mountains, rivers, and trees all at once, unseasonable great winds, black winds, blue winds, heavenly winds, earthly winds, fire winds, water winds—when such transformations occur, reading and expounding this sutra also constitutes the fifth difficulty." The interpretation says: The fifth wind disaster. Master Zang says: "Black wind" means coastal winds blowing black sand. Red wind means red sand; blue wind means blue sand. Heavenly wind and earthly wind—heaven is yang, earth is yin. Fire wind is hot wind. Dharma Master Di says: Winds have internal and external aspects. External winds have seven: First governs clouds and rain—if harmonized, the five grains flourish. Second governs cold and heat—if harmonized, there are no epidemics. Third governs stars and celestial bodies—if harmonized, there are no robber disasters. Fourth governs cultivating virtue—if harmonized, there are no ghost disasters.

Fifth governs marriage—if harmonized, people multiply. Sixth governs commerce—if harmonized, there is profit. Seventh governs longevity—if harmonized, lifespan is long.

The sutra says: "Heaven and earth, lands parched with blazing fire burning throughout, all plants withered and dry, five grains not ripening, earth scorched and blazing, myriad people perishing—when such transformations occur, reading and expounding this sutra also constitutes the sixth difficulty." The interpretation says: The sixth drought and barren failure disaster. Dharma Master Di says: There are five types of drought. First, earth domain—if ghosts and spirits become angry, they rain earth in the sky and use wind to blow rain elsewhere. Second, wind domain—using wind to disperse rain. Third, fire domain—using heat to evaporate rain. Fourth, asuras become angry and block rain—one finger blocks half of Jambudvīpa, two fingers block all four continents. Fifth, the rain-controlling deity becomes negligent and avoids rain. Rain also has five types: First, incantation power. Second, the rain-controlling deity acts according to seasons. Third, dragon kings bring rain. Fourth, asuras bring rain. Fifth, great rains from karmic affliction retribution at kalpa's end.

The sutra says: "Bandits from the four directions come to invade the country, internal and external bandits arise—fire bandits, water bandits, wind bandits, ghost bandits—people in chaos, warfare and calamities arising—when such strange occurrences happen, reading and expounding this sutra also constitutes the seventh difficulty." The interpretation says: The seventh evil bandit invasion disaster. As the text makes clear.

The sutra says: "Great King, this Prajñāpāramitā is the spiritual foundation of the mind-consciousness of all bodhisattvas and sentient beings, the father and mother of all kings, also called divine talisman, also called demon-dispelling jewel, also called wish-fulfilling jewel, also called nation-protecting jewel, also called heaven-earth mirror, also called dragon-treasure spirit king." The interpretation says: Praising the names to encourage upholding. However, regarding these eight names, various explanations differ. One says: Among the eight, the first manifests true characteristic perfection

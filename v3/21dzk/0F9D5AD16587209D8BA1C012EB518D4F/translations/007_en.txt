In this [context], based on the esoteric teaching, it says there are [pratyekabuddhas]. What the *Mahāvyūha-sūtra* explains is based on the manifest assembly, so there is no contradiction. One explanation says: Pratyekabuddhas naturally have two types. First are those of original nature, who emerge alone without companions. Second are those who were formerly śrāvakas and later became pratyekabuddhas. Like the five hundred sages who emerged at one time. The explanation says: The two sutras each refer to one type of person, so they also do not contradict. Some say: Pratyekabuddhas naturally have two types. First is the rhinoceros-horn type, who emerge alone without a second. Second is the group-wandering type, where many people emerge together. This has two types: first are those of pratyekabuddha nature, like the five hundred sages; second are those of śrāvaka nature, who are also the five hundred sages. The new *Vibhāṣā* says: "The five hundred sages are mostly of śrāvaka nature." The explanation says: Since it already uses the word "mostly," we therefore know that those explained in this sutra are either of śrāvaka nature or of pratyekabuddha nature. When it says they emerge in a buddha-less world, this is explained according to the majority.

The sutra says "neither annihilationist nor eternalist, the four truths and twelve conditions are all accomplished." The interpretation says: Second, separately praising merits. Among the four truths, the origination truth is the cause and the suffering truth is the effect. The twelve-fold dependent origination, from ignorance to old age and death, arise in mutual dependence. Such cause and effect all transcend annihilationism and eternalism. Moreover, cause and effect continue without interruption. Because causes cease, it is not eternal; because effects arise, it is not annihilationist. "Not eternal" refers precisely to the principle of dependent origination where cause and effect eternally transcend annihilationism and eternalism.

The sutra says "immeasurable merits are all accomplished." The interpretation says: This generally praises the merits of the sutra.

The sutra says "There were also nine hundred myriad koṭis of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas." The interpretation says: Third, manifesting the bodhisattva assembly. The text has four distinct parts: first, indicating numbers and clarifying types; second, briefly clarifying stages and grounds; third, separately praising merits; fourth,

generally concluding the merits. This is the first part. The various bodhisattvas each have roughly two types. First is the general designation, which has many varieties: first, called "bodhisattva"; second, called "mahāsattva dharma master" and so forth. Second is the specific designation, referring to Mañjuśrī, Maitreya, and others. The Sanskrit should be "bodhisattva-mahāsattva." Now we preserve the abbreviated form. "Bodhi" means "awakening" in Chinese. "Sattva" means "sentient being" in Chinese. That is, seeking great awakening above and transforming sentient beings below, having aspiration and ability, therefore called "awakened sentient being." "Mahā" means "great" in Chinese. "Sattva" is as above. Those called bodhisattvas of the eighth ground and above are properly called "great sentient beings." The extensive explanation is as usual.

The sutra says "all are arhats." The interpretation says: Second, briefly clarifying practice and stages. The meaning is as explained above. However, calling the various bodhisattvas "arhats" has three meanings: first, turning the mind toward the great while still using the original name to explain; second, being worthy of receiving wonderful offerings; third, the Buddha fruit is called "arhat." Great ground bodhisattvas are also thus.

The sutra says "true knowledge merits, skillful means wisdom merits, practicing the solitary great vehicle, four eyes, five supernatural powers, three penetrations, ten powers, four immeasurables, four eloquences, four means of gathering, vajra cessation samādhi." The interpretation says: Third, separately praising merits. This is divided into ten parts: first, skillful means and true reality two wisdom merits; second, practicing the solitary great vehicle merits; third, four eyes merits; fourth, five supernatural powers merits; fifth, three penetrations merits; sixth, ten powers merits; seventh, four immeasurables merits; eighth, four eloquences merits; ninth, four means of gathering merits; tenth, vajra cessation samādhi. Or it could be divided into eleven parts, because skillful means and true reality are two separate wisdoms. Or it could be divided into twelve parts, because vajra and cessation samādhi are two separate types. For now, following the first interpretation. This is the first—the two wisdoms gate. Regarding these two

wisdoms, the various explanations differ. One says: Fundamental wisdom is called "true wisdom" because it takes true reality as its object. Subsequently attained wisdom is called "skillful means" because it skillfully and expediently transforms sentient beings. Another says: Both fundamental and subsequently attained are called "true wisdom" because they can take both ultimate and conventional true realities as objects. Preparatory wisdom is called "skillful means" because it can generate fundamental wisdom. "Practicing the solitary great vehicle" praises the second merit. The four truths and dependent origination are practiced in common by both great and small [vehicles]. The six pāramitās are practiced only by bodhisattvas. Or perhaps: emptiness of persons is observed in common by both great and small [vehicles], but emptiness of dharmas belongs only to the great vehicle and does not extend to the small vehicle. "Four eyes" praises the third merit. Among the five eyes—flesh, divine, dharma, and wisdom—only the Buddha eye is excluded because [they] have not yet achieved buddhahood. The manifest body is called "flesh," and the eye's illuminating function is its designation; flesh is precisely this eye. There are three types of divine eye: first is the divine eye obtained through karmic reward, which is the eye of the divine realms like the four heavenly kings; second is the divine eye obtained through karmic reward by buddhas and bodhisattvas, which is this pure human eye; third is the divine eye born from the four dhyānas, which is cultivated and attained. Observing the various dharma gates is called the "dharma eye." Understanding and penetrating empty characteristics is called the "wisdom eye." These four eyes, being in the Buddha's body, are therefore called the "Buddha eye." Among the five, the flesh eye has form as its essence. The divine eye extends to both form and mind. Seeing present forms is precisely the eye faculty. Knowing the future belongs only to mind. The dharma and wisdom eyes use wisdom as their essence. The Buddha eye uses the four eyes as its essence. "Five supernatural powers" praises the fourth merit. Among the six supernatural powers, only the extinction of outflows is excluded. Bodhisattvas have not yet completely severed the afflictive obstructions. Having no eternal impediments regarding objects is called "supernatural power." The meaning is as commonly explained. All six supernatural powers have concentration, wisdom, and associated mental factors as their essence. "Three penetrations" praises the fifth merit. These are precisely the three knowledges. Because penetrating understanding is unobstructed, they are called "knowledge."

Penetrating the affairs of the three periods and eliminating the ignorance of the three periods—this is precisely their meaning. Question: Is there a difference between supernatural powers and knowledge? Answer: The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "Directly knowing the affairs of past lives is called 'supernatural power.' Completely knowing past causes, conditions, actions, and karma is called 'knowledge.' Directly knowing death here and birth there is called 'divine eye supernatural power.' Knowing the causes and conditions of various actions and the principle of non-arising of defiled attachment is called 'knowledge.' Directly knowing the exhaustion of fetters without knowing whether there will be further births or not is the supernatural power of outflow extinction. Knowing outflow extinction and whether there will be further births or not is called 'knowledge.'" "Three knowledges" refers to what great arhats and great pratyekabuddhas attain. The six supernatural powers and three knowledges represent a distinction between superior and inferior.

"Ten powers" praises the sixth merit. There are naturally two interpretations. Some say the ten powers belong only to buddhas and not others. Others say bodhisattvas also partially possess them. Therefore the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "Do bodhisattvas possess the ten powers and four fearlessnesses?" The answer is: "They also partially possess them." The "ten powers" are: the power of knowing what is possible and impossible, the power of knowing karmic actions, the power of knowing meditative concentrations and liberations and samādhis and attainments, the power of knowing superior and inferior faculties, the power of knowing various aspirations, the power of knowing various elements, the power of knowing the paths leading everywhere, the power of recollecting past abodes, the power of knowing death and birth, and the power of knowing the extinction of outflows. "Four fearlessnesses"... "Four immeasurables" explains the seventh merit. The subject, object, meritorious actions, and resulting fruits are all immeasurable. "Loving-kindness" has non-hatred as its essence. "Compassion" has non-harm as its essence. "Joy" has non-jealousy as its essence. "Equanimity" has non-greed and non-hatred as its essence. The extensive explanation is as usual. "Four eloquences" praises the eighth merit. They are also called the "four unobstructed understandings": unobstructed understanding of dharmas, unobstructed understanding of meanings, unobstructed understanding of languages, and eloquent...

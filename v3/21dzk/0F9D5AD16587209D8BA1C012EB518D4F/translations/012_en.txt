The sūtra says: "At this time the world and its earth shook in six ways." The interpretation says: Fifth, clarifying the six types of earthquakes. Speaking of "six types": east surging west sinking, west surging east sinking, north surging south sinking, south surging north sinking, edges surging center sinking, center surging edges sinking. Also: first shaking, second surging, third rising, fourth lifting, fifth descending, sixth roaring. The Long Āgama says: "Earthquakes have eight causes: first when great waters move, second when honored spirits test their power, third when Buddha enters the womb, fourth when exiting the womb, fifth when achieving enlightenment, sixth when turning the Dharma wheel, seventh when ceasing teaching, eighth when entering nirvāṇa." The Ekottara Āgama says: "First, Jambudvīpa's wind wheel, from above toward below, has earth, water, fire, wind, from below toward above, moving in sequence. Second, bodhisattva entering the womb; third, exiting the womb; fourth, leaving home and achieving enlightenment; fifth, entering nirvāṇa; sixth, supernatural monks attaining mental freedom; seventh, heavenly beings dying and returning to superior places; eighth, beings dying with merit exhausted, mutually replacing each other."

The sūtra says: "At that time the great assembly all together unanimously gave rise to doubt." The interpretation says: First the assembly raises doubt, next expresses doubt, finally questions the assembly without resolution. This is the beginning.

The sūtra says: "Each said to one another: 'The four fearlessnesses, eighteen exclusive dharmas, five eyes, Dharma body, Great Enlightened World-Honored One has already taught our great assembly for twenty-nine years the Mahāprajñāpāramitā, Diamond Prajñāpāramitā, Heavenly King's Questions Prajñāpāramitā, Luminous Praise Prajñāpāramitā.'" The interpretation says: Next expressing the assembly's doubts. First praising Buddha's virtues, next acknowledging previous events, finally properly expressing doubt. Speaking of "four fearlessnesses": namely all-knowledge fearlessness, exhaustion of outflows fearlessness, path to end suffering fearlessness, speaking of obstructive paths fearlessness. Speaking of "eighteen exclusive dharmas": there are two types. First, the small

vehicle says: ten powers, four fearlessnesses, three mindful abidings, and great compassion (three mindful abidings means non-greed, non-hatred, equanimous action). The great vehicle says: first, body without error; second, speech without error; third, mind without error; fourth, no different characteristics; fifth, no unsettled mind; sixth, no unknowing abandonment; seventh, desire without decrease; eighth, vigor without decrease; ninth, mindfulness without decrease; tenth, wisdom without decrease; eleventh, liberation without decrease; twelfth, liberation knowledge-vision without decrease; thirteenth, all bodily actions following wisdom conduct; fourteenth, speech actions following wisdom conduct; fifteenth, mental actions following wisdom conduct; sixteenth, wisdom knowing past without obstruction; seventeenth, wisdom knowing future without obstruction; eighteenth, wisdom knowing present without obstruction. Not shared with the two vehicles, hence called exclusive dharmas. Speaking of "five eyes": among the previous four eyes, further adding the Buddha eye. Speaking of "Dharma body": the small vehicle says five-aspect Dharma body. The great vehicle says: if wisdom Dharma body, the four wisdoms are its essence; if principle Dharma body, suchness is its essence. Speaking of "Great Enlightened World-Honored One": the person accomplished by virtues, the conventional entity of five aggregates. "Previously already for us" acknowledges previous events. Namely, previously already for our great assembly, in the first twenty-nine years after initial enlightenment, taught four Prajñāpāramitās: first Mahāprajñāpāramitā, second Diamond, third Heavenly King's Questions, fourth Luminous Praise. The interpretation says: The original record's explanation says: "Now according to this sūtra, it should form five sections. Traditionally transmitted, there are two types of eight sections. First, eight sections circulating in this land: first Great Perfection Prajñāpāramitā, second Small Perfection Prajñāpāramitā, third Mañjuśrī Prajñāpāramitā, fourth Diamond Prajñāpāramitā, fifth Luminous Praise Prajñāpāramitā, sixth Path Practice Prajñāpāramitā, seventh Victory over Heaven Prajñāpāramitā, eighth Benevolent Kings Prajñāpāramitā. Second, according to Bodhiruci's Diamond Immortal Treatise's eight sections: first hundred thousand verse section, second twenty-five thousand verse section. These upper two sections are not yet available here. Third, eighteen thousand verse section.

【Left page, upper section】
The Great Perfection is this. The four thousand verse section is the Small Perfection Prajñāpāramitā. Fifth is four thousand verse section, not yet available here. Sixth is twenty-five hundred verses, namely Heavenly King's Questions Prajñāpāramitā. Seventh is six hundred verse section, namely Mañjuśrī's Questions. Eighth is three hundred verse section, namely Diamond Prajñāpāramitā. If following what Paramārtha's Diamond Prajñāpāramitā Commentary says, the eight-section Prajñāpāramitā also agrees with Bodhiruci. The difference is that the eighth section also says it's not yet available here. Now asking Master Rizhao and the Khotan Master, all following this explanation, but at their place they haven't heard the names of eight sections. Now following the Great Prajñāpāramitā's four locations sixteen assemblies, it doesn't include Benevolent Kings Prajñāpāramitā. Also Master Cien says the West doesn't call it eight sections." Question: According to Great Prajñāpāramitā, among sixteen assemblies, Mahāprajñāpāramitā is the second assembly, Diamond Prajñāpāramitā is the ninth assembly, Heavenly King's Questions is the sixth assembly, Luminous Praise is also the second assembly. How does this sūtra not follow that sixteen assemblies' sequence? The interpretation says: This section should logically follow that sequence and should also comprehensively explain other sections, but translators, following what they heard, explained these four sections. Speaking of "four locations": first Rājagṛha Vulture Peak Mountain, second Śrāvastī Jeta Grove, third Paranirmita-vaśavartin Heaven, fourth Rājagṛha White Heron Pond side teaching. The first five assemblies all teach the six perfections. Though the texts vary in length, their meanings have no breadth or narrowness. Therefore Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva, depending on the second section, composed the Wisdom Treatise. Next there are five assemblies, then difficult to determine. Later there are six assemblies, in sequence teaching their six perfections. However, the sixteen assemblies not including this one section is because the Tathāgata establishes teachings following different capacities.

The sūtra says: "Today the Tathāgata emits great light characteristics - what deed is this?" The interpretation says: Third, properly expressing doubtful

feelings. Namely, previously emitting light and so forth, teaching four Prajñāpāramitās. Now afterward emitting light - what deed is this?

The sūtra says: "At that time among the sixteen great country kings, the ruler of Śrāvastī country, King Prasenajit, named Moonlight." The interpretation says: Third, questioning the assembly without resolution. First the king questions the assembly, then clarifying the assembly's lack of resolution. Speaking of "Śrāvastī country": this is the capital city name of Kośala country. The correct pronunciation is Śrāvastī. This means "Abundant Virtue." There are four abundances: namely liberation abundance, much learning abundance, desire object abundance, wealth abundance. Also hearing objects etc. (hearing objects is probably another translation name for Śrāvastī). Speaking of "Prasenajit": this means "Victory Army." This is the secular designation. Named Moonlight: the original record says: "The king's surname is Moon. After hearing the Dharma, he further established the name Light." Master Zang says: "If naming according to parents, he's named Victory Army. Born on the same day as the Tathāgata. Later greatly heroic and strategic, able to pacify strong enemies. Wherever he fought he constantly won. His parents named him Victory Army. Second, Moonlight is what worldly people call him. Buddha is like sunlight, Prasenajit assists transformation like the moon, hence named Moonlight." Paramārtha says: "This country ruler's surname is Moon, name is Prasenajit. This should be after hearing the Dharma he further established the name Light, hence called Moonlight."

The sūtra says: "Virtue practicing ten stages, six perfections, thirty-seven factors, four indestructible purities, practicing Mahāyāna transformation." The interpretation says: This praises virtue. Namely abiding in the holy Supreme Joy and other ten stages, practicing giving and other six perfections. Speaking of "thirty-seven factors": namely four foundations of mindfulness, four right efforts, five faculties, five powers, seven enlightenment factors, eight noble paths. Speaking of "Mahāyāna": this means "Great Vehicle." Practicing self-benefit and benefiting others, being equal hence named transformation.

The sūtra says: "In sequence questioning householder Jeweled Canopy Dharma Pure Name and others eight hundred people, again questioning Subhūti, Śāri-

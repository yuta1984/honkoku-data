It is interpreted according to two meanings: namely, the meaning of awakening and the meaning of development. First, regarding the exhaustion of the two [types of] delusion and sleep to attain awakening, it is like a person waking up. Second, regarding境界 (objects), illuminating, understanding, and developing, it is like a lotus flower opening. If we follow the *Buddha-bhūmi-śāstra*, it is interpreted with five meanings: first, possessing the two characteristics; second, severing the two obstructions; third, illuminating the two realms; fourth, providing the two benefits; fifth, being equal to the two analogies. According to the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā*, because it contains six or eight meanings, it is called Buddha. First, the meaning of generally possessing all virtues; second, the meaning of personally awakening to true dharma; third, the meaning of penetrating true dharma; fourth, the meaning of correctly awakening to the two natures; fifth, the meaning of unobstructed wisdom functioning; sixth, the meaning of awakening sentient beings. The eight meanings are: first, awakening according to true meaning; second, awakening to true dharma; third, because of the meaning of penetration; fourth, because of truly manifesting awakening regarding all dharmas; fifth, because one can awaken to all the individual characteristics, common characteristics, existent characteristics, and non-existent characteristics of all dharmas; sixth, because unobstructed knowledge functions regarding all aspects of past, present, and future dharmas as well as unconditioned dharmas; seventh, because one truly awakens all sentient beings and causes them to leave behind delusion, evil karma, and various sufferings; eighth, because one can truly awaken to all dharma-characteristics. Next, regarding the Buddha-body that is expounded: speaking of the two bodies that correctly benefit others and transform others, if we rely on transformative function, it does not separate from the essential body, and is also the enjoyment body. If one transforms regarding the essence, this is precisely suchness, included in the dharma-body. That master says: In Sanskrit it is called "buddha," abbreviated as "buddha" in Chinese. The master endowed with wisdom, in Tang Chinese called "the awakened one." Awakening has three meanings: first, self-awakening, superior to ordinary beings, because ordinary beings do not awaken themselves; second, awakening others, superior to the two vehicles, because they do not awaken others; third, perfect awakening practice, superior to bodhisattvas, because their awakening practice is not yet complete. Question: Among these three bodies, which body does this belong to? Answer: According to place and capacity, this could be the transformation body. According to text and vessel, this is precisely the reward body. The root capacities of those who respond are various

and not the same. Because it manifests according to response, it encompasses the three bodies.

The sutra says "dwelling in Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha." The interpretation says: Fourth is the place where the sutra was taught. "Magadha" and "Magadha" are all corrupted transmissions. Correctly it is called "Magadha country," which means "country of excellent victory." Wandering to teach and dwelling, this becomes "dwelling." Dwelling in the mountain, wandering to teach in the city. The Buddha wandered to teach and peacefully abided in this place. Ancient people used this to understand the dwelling of sages, gods, Brahmā, Buddha, etc. Though the name "dwelling" is the same, the meanings are completely different. In Sanskrit it is called "Kuśāgārapura city," in Tang Chinese called "Upper Grass City." It is in the exact center of Magadha country, the place where ancient former kings established their capital. Because it produces much excellent and auspicious grass, it was named accordingly. Northeast of the city, on Gṛdhrakūṭa mountain, in Tang Chinese called "Vulture Peak," also called "Vulture Platform." Adjoining the south side of the northern mountain, standing alone prominently. Both harboring vultures and resembling a high platform, with verdant colors reflecting each other, deep and light colors dividing. After the Buddha's enlightenment, for nearly fifty years, he dwelt much on this mountain and extensively taught the wonderful dharma. Formerly called "Gṛdhrakūṭa mountain" or "Spiritual Vulture Mountain." Because birds eat human corpses here, it is called "Spiritual Vulture Mountain"—a corruption and abbreviation. Northwest of the mountain city, there are the four cities of Rājagṛha. In Tang Chinese called "Royal City." With a circumference of over twenty li, each face having one gate. Since the royal capital is already in the royal residence, and the Buddha dwelt on Vulture Peak, both city and mountain are manifest together, explaining both self-transformation and other-transformation, benefiting both monks and laypeople. The city is precisely the center of Magadha country, where human kings establish their capital. The place represents the middle way of the one vehicle and even the three vehicles, the realm where the dharma king dwells. Since the city surpasses other cities, therefore the sutra surpasses other sutras.

The sutra says "with the great bhikṣu assembly of eight hundred myriad koṭis." The interpretation says: From here onward is the fifth—those who are the object [of the teaching]. Within this there are two parts: first, separately showing ranks and virtues; second, generally concluding the assembly. In the section on separate showing, there are twelve assemblies: first, śrāvakas; second, pratyekabuddhas; third, bodhisattvas; fourth, upāsakas; fifth, upāsikās; sixth, householders; seventh, form realm gods; eighth, desire realm gods; ninth, human kings; tenth, miscellaneous types; eleventh, other regions; twelfth, transformations. Though there are twelve, they are generally gathered into three: the first ten are from this realm, the next one is from other realms, the last one is transformations. Regarding the śrāvaka assembly, the text separately has four parts: first, indicating the type and clarifying the number; second, briefly clarifying practice and position; third, separately showing ranks and virtues; fourth, generally concluding the virtues. This is precisely the first—indicating the type and clarifying the number. "With the great bhikṣu assembly" indicates a distinct different type. There are twelve types. This is precisely the first, clarifying the śrāvaka assembly. To distinguish from other vehicles, it is called śrāvaka. The *Satyasiddhi-śāstra* says: "Hearing the dharma and attaining awakening, therefore called śrāvaka." The *Buddha-bhūmi-śāstra* says: "Hearing the Buddha's voice and entering the noble path, therefore called śrāvaka." Also the *Yogācāra* says: "Listening to and hearing the sounds of correct dharma from others, and also enabling others to hear the sounds of correct dharma, therefore called śrāvaka." Now saying "bhikṣu assembly" is a specific designation among the seven, distinguishing from nuns and the other six. Therefore raising the name "bhikṣu" manifests the śrāvaka assembly. The text has four sections: first, "with"; second, "great"; third, "bhikṣu"; fourth, explaining "assembly." The Buddha's body includes them, which is called "with." Also, "with" means "together." The various bhikṣu assemblies share seven meanings, therefore called "with." Hence the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "One place, one time, one mind, one precept, one view, one path, one liberation—this is called 'together.'" The "with" in this sutra is precisely that "together." What is called "great," according to the interpretation of the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra*, has three meanings: first, great; second, many; third, excellent. Being supreme among the assembly,

having severed all obstructions, being respected by kings and others, it is called "great." Being extremely numerous, it is called "many." Being able to defeat the ninety-six kinds of non-Buddhist schools, it is called "excellent." According to the *Buddha-bhūmi-śāstra*, "great" has four interpretations: first, great because of sharp faculties; second, great because of being beyond learning; third, great because of dedicating toward the great; fourth, great because of being numerous. The detailed explanation is as given there. "Bhikṣu" is translated as "mendicant." Diamond Immortal says: "Bhikṣu is Sanskrit. In interpretation in this region, it is sometimes called 'mendicant,' sometimes called 'destroyer of evil,' sometimes called 'frightener of demons.'" Also the fundamental record says: "In the causal stage it is called 'frightener of demons, mendicant, destroyer of evil'; when reaching the fruit, 'frightener of demons' is transformed into 'killer of thieves,' 'mendicant' is changed to 'worthy of offerings,' and 'destroyer of evil' is explained as 'no more birth.'" Also in the *Yogācāra*, fascicle 29, there are five types of bhikṣu: first, begging bhikṣu; second, self-proclaimed bhikṣu; third, name-conceived bhikṣu; fourth, affliction-destroying bhikṣu; fifth, formal ordination bhikṣu. The present bhikṣus are precisely the fourth and fifth types among the five. What is called "assembly": the Sanskrit sound is saṃgha, translated as "harmonious assembly." Because of harmony in both principle and phenomena, it is called "assembly." "Eight hundred myriad koṭis" clarifies the number. Generally discussing "koṭi," there are four types: first, one hundred thousand makes one koṭi; second, one million makes one koṭi; third, ten million makes one koṓi; fourth, ten thousand times ten thousand makes one koṭi. Question: What position does koṭi correspond to? Answer: It corresponds to the ten million position. The *Buddha's Previous Lives Sutra* and *Abhidharma-samuccaya* both say "ten thousand times one thousand is called koṭi," which corresponds to ten million. Question: Why is the bhikṣuṇī assembly not mentioned? Answer: There are two reasons: first, for brevity; second, focusing on the superior.

The sutra says "learners and non-learners, all arhats." The interpretation says: Second, briefly clarifying practice and virtue. "Arhat" is the general name for practice and virtue. In translation it contains multiple meanings, comprehensively embracing the fruits and virtues of the three vehicles' non-learners. All have already permanently destroyed afflictions.

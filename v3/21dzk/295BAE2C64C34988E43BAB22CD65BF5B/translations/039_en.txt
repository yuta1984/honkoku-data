Question: The sūtra text states "extensively expounding and disseminating for sentient beings, and those who listen to the Dharma," etc. {Composed by Shiki Hanshin} So among the ten Dharma practices, how many practices does it explain? Answer: The commentary says "it explains the two practices of exposition and listening, and briefly omits the others." Regarding this, it should be said to explain three practices: exposition is opening and teaching, dissemination is giving to others, and "those who listen to the Dharma" is listening. Based on this, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra says: "World-Honored One, if there are those who, regarding this profound prajñāpāramitā, wholeheartedly listen, uphold, recite, diligently study, contemplate according to principle, explain, copy, and extensively disseminate..." The meaning of this text is that dissemination is giving to others. Additionally, in the commentary on the entrustment chapter, explaining the sūtra text "making offerings with reverence, copying and circulating, explaining for people," it explains "circulation is giving to others." So the present explanation is unclear. How is this?

My view: Truly as the doubt states, dissemination should indeed be giving to others. However, regarding the present explanation, there should be a different intention. That is, regarding the text "expounding and disseminating, and those who listen to the Dharma," it presents two types of contrast: initial cultivation versus long cultivation, i.e., self-benefit versus benefiting others. Those with long cultivation engage in exposition, which is the meaning of benefiting others. Those with initial cultivation should listen, which is the meaning of self-benefit {this is one}. Or it contrasts those who can speak with those who can listen. Exposition is being able to speak, listening is being able to hear {this is two}. Therefore, to show these two contrasts, exposition is made equivalent to dissemination, not meaning the aspect where dissemination equals giving to others. Therefore there is no fault.

Someone says: Regarding giving, there are three types: material giving, Dharma giving, and fearlessness giving. However, ordinary giving to others is material giving. Dissemination is generally Dharma giving and not material giving, so this present exposition

being equivalent to circulation does not raise the aspect of giving to others.

Question: The sūtra text says "seeing my honored Muni," etc. {Composed by Shiki Kōin} So which of the three bodies is this? The commentary says "it is the reward body." Regarding this, according to the explanation, examining the sūtra text, the next passage says "with delightful wonderful voice, expounding this sūtra," etc. This is the speaker of the present sūtra, showing that the three vehicles equally see the transformation body. Should it specifically be called the transformation body? It says "Muni adorned with a hundred merits" and describes "Muni with tranquil and concentrated faculties" - isn't this the transformation body? Moreover, at the Lotus assembly, Śākyamuni seated together with Prabhūtaratna - is this the transformation body? The present explanation is unclear. How is this?

My view: The Vijñānavāda root verses say "the great Muni's name is Dharma," etc. The commentary explains the word muni: "In Sanskrit muni, here called 'silent tranquility.' The dharma of silent tranquility is dharma beyond words, or because it is free from faults, it is called silent tranquility." Therefore muni properly designates the Dharma body. However, regarding the two bodies of reward and transformation, this meaning should also apply. The reward body is tranquil with capable-of-realizing wisdom; the transformation body also can tranquilly realize dharma. Here, looking at the text of the Bodhi Tree Spirit's Praise chapter below: "Muni with tranquil and concentrated faculties, able to enter the tranquil nirvana city, able to enter the tranquil samādhi gate," etc. That commentary sometimes calls it the reward body, sometimes the transformation body, dividing into two explanations. The present commentary is the intention of one of those explanations. However, this explanation's meaning is that by stating "with delightful wonderful voice, expounding this sūtra," it manifestly raises the capable speaker of the present sūtra. The sūtra text appears not to be the Dharma body. If not the Dharma body, it should be the reward body, because it is tranquil with capable-of-realizing wisdom. It properly explains self-enjoyment and concurrently manifests other-enjoyment, saying "expounding this sūtra."

Someone objects: Muni means "without contention" and is a name for the transformation body. The Buddha-Land Principles Forest cites the Yogācārabhūmi Sūtra saying "Śākyamuni Buddha is the transformation body." Also, the tenth volume commentary says regarding "Muni with tranquil and concentrated faculties," the reason it is the transformation body is because it has the word muni. If it properly names the Dharma body, how are these explanations? Next, the reason this present text is the reward body is not clear, is it?

Response: This objection is most difficult to answer. Reconciling it in one way: "Śākyamuni Buddha is the transformation body" - when correlating Vairocana as Dharma body and Rocana as reward body, it explains muni as transformation body. Even saying this, it does not exclusively call it the transformation body. Next, other commentary explanations judge according to common custom. In the teachings, Śākyamuni is constantly called muni. Sometimes calling it transformation body is because there are instances arising from muni, so it says this. Next, regarding this present reward body matter: other places' muni language appears to be entirely transformation body in complete texts, so they say this. If this shows it is not the Dharma body, then next, because it is capable of realization, it should clarify the reward body.

Question: The sūtra text says "Vaiśravaṇa Great Shoulder," etc. How does the commentary master explain this? The commentary says "it is an alternative name for Nārāyaṇa Deva." Regarding this, the sūtra's next passage below says "Nārāyaṇa Sovereign," etc. If Vaiśravaṇa Great Shoulder is Nārāyaṇa, isn't this redundant and useless? The commentary master's explanation must have deep meaning. How is this?

My view: Sun, Moon, Indra, etc. are listed among the constellation types. Next, Great Power Yakṣa King Nārāyaṇa Sovereign is raised among yakṣas. For example, those goddess Great Eloquence, etc.

【Lower section】
are listed among the celestial chiefs, and next Ghaṇṭā Eloquence, etc. are also listed among earthly dwelling assemblies, again presenting Sarasvatī. Raising them again all takes different forms. Or Vaiśravaṇa Great Shoulder is Nārāyaṇa Deva. The lower Nārāyaṇa Sovereign is not the upper Nārāyaṇa Deva. Since it adds the word "sovereign," we know it is a different category.

Question: In this volume's commentary, clarifying Śākyamuni's causal practices, "when the third asaṃkhyeya was completed, he met Buddha Vipaśyin," etc. So is this present Buddha Vipaśyin the same as Buddha Puṣya or not? If they are one buddha, in the Buddha's Past Actions Collection Sūtra, clarifying Śākyamuni's prediction, Buddha Puṣya, after ninety-four eons passed, predicted he would attain buddhahood, and Buddha Vipaśyin, after ninety-one eons passed, predicted he would attain buddhahood. From this we know they are separate buddhas. Following this, in the Avataṃsaka Sūtra they are listed separately. If this is the case, in the present commentary it explains "Buddha Vipaśyin is Buddha Puṣya." How is this?

My view: The present sūtra commentary says: "When the third eon was completed, cultivating the karma of marks and characteristics, first meeting Buddha Vipaśyin, also called Puṣya." This explanation should not be changed. Also, Xuanzan volume 2 says: "When the third eon was completed, cultivating the karma of marks and characteristics for a hundred eons, first meeting Buddha Vipaśyin, namely Vipaśyin." This explanation is also clear. Here, examining the three buddhas Vipaśyin, Vipaśyin, and Puṣya: Vipaśyin is Sanskrit, here called "superior contemplation" {this is the meaning of Prajñā Assembly Commentary, Xuanzan, and Manifesting the Obscure Commentary}. Next, that "superior contemplation is Puṣya" appears in the Prajñā Assembly Commentary. That is, when cultivating the karma of marks and characteristics for a hundred eons, first meeting Buddha Vipaśyin, this is called "superior contemplation." Because by raising his foot he transcended nine eons. Since it says superior contemplation performed the foot-raising practice and transcended nine eons, this explanation of superior

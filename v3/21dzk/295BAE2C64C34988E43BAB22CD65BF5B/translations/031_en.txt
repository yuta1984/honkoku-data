"Possessing the four unobstructed eloquences is immediately called the four total retentions." The explanation clearly shows that mantras and birthlessness are what is retained. If depending on this being so, then in Master Puyangʼs Compendium Commentary, describing the matter of including the four unobstructed in the four total retentions, it says "eloquence unobstructed understanding belongs to dharma total retention, analytical unobstructed understanding belongs to the two types dharma and meaning." If they are the retained fruits of mantra and patience with birthlessness, why are they not included accordingly? Clearly knowing that the two types of analytical and eloquence retentions are not fruits of mantra and patience with birthlessness. How is this?

In my view: Regarding the four types of dharma, eloquence, and analytical, understanding them without obstruction and explaining them without obstruction is called the four unobstructed eloquences. Therefore, properly making them retained as fruits should be discussed in relation to the two types of dhāraṇī: dharma and meaning. Dharma dhāraṇī is the expressive teaching; meaning dhāraṇī is the expressed meaning. Being able to retain these is called the two dhāraṇī of dharma and meaning. Mantra dhāraṇī consists of textual meaning phrases and verses, and depending on these there is威 efficacious verification. Patience with birthlessness total retention means the essence of patience is wisdom itself. Therefore it directly relates to these two types. Unobstructed eloquence should not be called the retained fruit. Here the Compendium Commentary explains "eloquence unobstructed understanding belongs to dharma total retention, analytical unobstructed understanding belongs to the two types of dharma and meaning total retention," and does not discuss this in relation to mantra and patience with birthlessness. If discussing this distantly, depending on mantra and patience with birthlessness, it could be the retained fruit. The present commentary's explanation should have this mind. However, regarding the Profound Praise explanation, following the two explanations of the Compendium Commentary, it is not like the doubt and difficulty.

Asking again: Properly examining the beginning and end of the Profound Praise, "There are four total retentions. In order to attain dharma, meaning, analytical talent, and eloquence unobstructed understanding. The four are explained accordingly." The mind is that the four types of total retention explain the four types of total retention accordingly in order to attain the four unobstructed understandings of dharma, meaning, analytical, and eloquence. Also mutually clarifying that the four types of total retention take the four unobstructed understandings as retained fruits, as seen. The two explanations of the Compendium Commentary seem to contradict the present text of the Profound Praise. How is this?

Answering: Puyang was Cienʼs senior disciple. Knowing the original intention of the Profound Praise should follow the Compendium Commentary. First, the mind of the initial explanation: marking "there are four total retentions," the dharma essence of retaining total retention should be presented, as seen. However, it raises analytical talent and eloquence unobstructed. We know the text of the Profound Praise is mistaken. Correctly it should list dharma, meaning, mantra, and patience with birthlessness. Moreover, looking at the Profound Praise next below, it presents the four total retentions of dharma, meaning, mantra, and patience with birthlessness to answer this. We know what the question raises should be the four total retentions. This raises fruits and the beginning and end do not accord. Therefore the Profound Praise places the two characters "in order to attain" - is this mistaken? The next explanation's intention: although the Profound Praise is not direct fruit, because there is the aspect of being fruit, generally making the four total retentions the retainer and the four unobstructed understandings the retained fruits. The Compendium Commentary explores the intention that the correct direct fruits are: eloquence unobstructed understanding is the fruit of dharma total retention, analytical talent is the fruit of the two total retentions dharma and meaning. Truly Puyangʼs explanatory intention is profound.

Profound Praise 10 says: "Question: There are four total retentions. In order to attain dharma, meaning, analytical talent, and eloquence unobstructed understanding. The four are explained accordingly. What does this explain? Answer: The above prose discusses dharma and meaning retention. Now this mantra retention is to protect the former two. Therefore it is clarified. There is no attaining patience with birthlessness total retention."

Compendium Commentary 4 says: "There are four total retentions, namely dharma, meaning, etc. However, the four total retentions are: first dharma, second meaning, third mantra, fourth able to attain the bodhisattvaʼs patience with birthlessness. What is established in the commentary as analytical talent and eloquence has two meanings. First, the commentary is mistaken. Analytical talent and eloquence are not total retentions. Second, not mistaken. Eloquence unobstructed understanding belongs to dharma total retention. Analytical talent unobstructed generally belongs within dharma and meaning total retentions. Therefore it raises them."

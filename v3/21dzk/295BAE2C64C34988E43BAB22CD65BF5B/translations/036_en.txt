Question: In this volume's sūtra text, regarding the clarification of the meaning of transcending eons, does the third incalculable eon actually have the meaning of transcending eons, or how is it? Considering both sides. If there is the meaning of transcending eons, then after entering the grounds, the power of each ground is equal, and in the place of uniform advancement, even before the seventh ground it would be difficult to have the meaning of transcending eons. How much more so for the eighth ground and above where there is momentary advancement? Or perhaps the Treatise on Awakening Faith explains that one should transcend eons from the eighth ground and above, showing transcending grounds and swift accomplishment of perfect enlightenment for the sake of timid sentient beings. Based on this, examining the text of the Prajñāpāramitā Treatise (Volume 10), which quotes the Ten Grounds Sūtra and explains the seven exhortations of the buddhas regarding bodhisattvas of the eighth ground and above, it judges this as the fulfillment mind of the seventh ground. If there were actual transcending of eons from the eighth ground and above, why would one forcefully call it the fulfillment mind of the seventh ground? If, based on this, there is no actual transcending of eons, then in this volume's commentary, it judges that Śākyamuni Bodhisattva transcended eight eons for the sake of the brahman seer as the beginning of the third incalculable eon, and explains that praising Buddha Puṣya and transcending nine eons is the fulfillment mind of the tenth ground. Thus both sides are unclear. How is this? 《Composed by Shiki Chōshun》

My view: Transcending eons on the grounds is a difficult doctrine from ancient times to now. Among these, transcending eons from the eighth ground and above is truly difficult and cannot be easily established. However, Great Master Cien, in this volume's commentary and the tenth volume's commentary, explains transcending eons from the eighth ground and above. Though I do not know the deep intention, I can answer by presenting that explanation. First, this volume's commentary has two explanations. The first explanation states: "There is a certain class that dwells much in contemplative mind, or indulges long in cessation concentration; in contrast to this there is transcending." Regarding whether the mind enters cessation concentration or not, there are differences in transcending sequence. The momentary advancement of the eighth ground and above refers to the long period after dwelling and emerging from the eighth ground and above. Regarding the entering mind, one discusses the presence or absence of transcending eons. Momentary advancement refers to what is explained regarding after dwelling and emerging. The second explanation discusses transcending eons through the comparison of wisdom-predominant versus compassion-predominant, and the comparison of fearing afflictions versus not fearing afflictions. Next, the three explanations in the Chapter on Abandoning the Body: The first explanation's meaning is that actual transcending of eons exists only before the seventh ground, because the eighth ground and above is a place of moment-by-moment progressive advancement. Thus Śākyamuni's transcending of forty eons all occurred before the seventh ground. The actual internal transcending of spreading hair, etc., occurred previously. Since the faculties of those being taught matured upon reaching the eighth ground and above, upon reaching there one shows the characteristics of external transcending of eons. The second explanation states that actual transcending of eons exists up to the tenth ground. Momentary advancement is discussed regarding self-benefit; regarding benefiting others, it is not necessarily advancement, so the transcending of spreading hair, etc., is considered actual. The third explanation: the first explanation considers transcending from the eighth ground and above to be purely transcending in terms of manifestation characteristics; the second explanation considers transcending from the eighth ground and above to also include the actual, so the third explanation combines the previous two meanings, thus being able to explain transcending. It states that transcending from the eighth ground and above encompasses both manifestation and actual meanings. That is, the transcending of spreading hair is actual, while the transcending of standing on tiptoes is manifestation. Therefore, following the commentaries of both places, there is no further contradiction in transcending eons from the eighth ground and above. However, regarding the text of the Treatise on Awakening Faith, those who do not undergo incalculable eons of practice are said to be manifestation characteristics. Thus that is a separate matter. Next, regarding what the Prajñāpāramitā Treatise explains: though there may be actual transcending of eons in the eighth ground and above, including entering and not entering cessation concentration, etc., one should not reach the seven exhortations of the buddhas. Therefore, the seven exhortations of the buddhas in the Ten Grounds Sūtra are judged to explain the entering mind of the seventh ground. This does not mean not permitting transcending eons from the eighth ground and above.

Question: Regarding the sūtra text's clarification of the meaning of receiving prophecy to become buddha 《Composed by Shiki Kōgen》, when manifesting the eight aspects of attaining enlightenment in the causal stage, does one give prophecies of the names of countries, eons, etc., for becoming buddha to sentient beings being taught, or how is it? Considering both sides. If one does not give prophecies, having already manifested the tathāgata body to generate thoughts of supreme enlightenment, if one does not record matters of attaining enlightenment, countries, eons, etc., for bodhisattvas being taught, who could believe in omniscience? Moreover, a supreme world-honored one must have heir-apparent bodhisattvas. When giving prophecies to those bodhisattvas, how could one not record countries, eons, etc.? Based on this, the Lotus Sūtra explains the dragon daughter's attainment of enlightenment, stating "Immeasurable sentient beings received prophecies of the Way, three thousand sentient beings generated bodhicitta and received prophecies," specifically mentioning the benefits of receiving prophecies, distinct from texts about general prophecies. We know that countries, eons, etc., should be recorded. If this is so, then in the present commentary it states "tenth ground bodhisattvas and the previous five stages receive only general characteristic prophecies." Even if one manifests the eight aspects of attaining enlightenment, this is already the causal stage. How could one give prophecies of buddha countries, etc.?

My view: Since buddhas know the names of future buddha countries, eons, etc., they record them in detail. Being of the same stage, they can know and record them. Bodhisattvas are not of the same stage as future buddhas. How would they know and record them? The commentary states "those below cannot know matters above," which is precisely this meaning. Like the Bodhisattva Never Disparaging, who simply used general characteristics to prophesy "you shall attain buddhahood." Manifesting the tathāgata body to let them see and hear form, color, and sound - even if one does not record names, etc., how would this not generate faith and reverence? The Lotus Sūtra's explanation that names, etc., are not recorded - isn't this because it would be difficult to achieve in the future?

Question: In this volume's commentary, without clarifying the differences in eon numbers, is the quantity of the present Bhadrakalpa twenty intermediate eons, or how is it? Considering both sides. If it is twenty intermediate eons, then in the first eon of the formation period, auspicious flowers bloomed once, representing the appearance of a thousand buddhas and gaining the name Bhadrakalpa. Yet ninety-nine tathāgatas appear in the previous great eon, and Rucika Buddha appears in the later great eon - this is the arrangement of the sūtras and treatises (Bhadrakalpika Sūtra). If it is twenty intermediate eons, how are there previous and later great eons? Moreover, in the Vajrapāṇi Sūtra, explaining Rucika's original vow: "When I attain buddhahood, dwelling alone for one eon, with sentient beings of extensive lifespans, equal with all," etc. If it manifests twenty intermediate eons, the remaining number of eons is not many. How could it say "equal with all"? Based on this, the present commentary and other places mention "two times eighty eons." If this is so, then in the Great Master's other work (Yogācāra Commentary, Eon Chapter Verses) it says "twenty intermediate eons." How is this?

My view: Regarding the quantity of the Bhadrakalpa, though there are two doctrines, the doctrine taking twenty intermediate eons as the measure should be the actual doctrine of the transmitted teaching. Thus in the Yogācāra Commentary, the initial explanation taking two times eighty eons as the Bhadrakalpa is judged as "not the present explanation, incorrect," while the latter doctrine taking twenty intermediate eons as the quantity of the Bhadrakalpa is judged as "transmitted explanation from the West." Dharma Master Guang judged this doctrine as the preceptor's doctrine. From this we know that this present doctrine is the actual doctrine transmitted by the Tripiṭaka Master from the Western Heaven. The explanations of sūtras and treatises intersect, and the explanations of our school's masters are like tangled silk. The actual doctrine held is difficult to fathom. Following these explanations, we should establish this doctrine. In the Bodhisattva from the Womb Sūtra, explaining Brahmā's lifespan, it exceeds

If this is so, then in the present commentary it states "tenth ground bodhisattvas and the previous five stages receive only general characteristic prophecies." Even if one manifests the eight aspects of attaining enlightenment, this is already the causal stage. How could one give prophecies of buddha lands, etc.?

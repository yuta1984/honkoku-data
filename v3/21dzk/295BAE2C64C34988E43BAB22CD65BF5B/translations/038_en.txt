It should be read as "community of monks (bhikṣu-saṃgha)."

Question: In the present sūtra commentary, while not clarifying the bodhisattva stages, can lower-realm transformation-body bodhisattvas see upper-realm birth-and-death bodies? Considering both sides. If they can see them, since upper and lower realms are vastly different, even transformation-body bodhisattvas should completely be unable to see upper-realm bodies. Based on this, the present commentary explains "those below do not see those above." If this is the case, having already attained the sublime transformation body, why would they not see the coarse and inferior birth-and-death body?

My view: The five sense organs possessed by the transformation body are sublime in dependence on the body, so following seeing, they should be called sublime. If sublime, since their cause differs from the sense organs possessed by birth-and-death bodies, even though upper and lower differ, can the eye organ of lower-realm transformation-body bodhisattvas see upper-realm birth-and-death bodies? Taking the lower-realm transformation body in comparison to upper-realm birth-and-death bodies, the upper-realm birth-and-death bodies should still be coarse and inferior. However, regarding the present commentary's explanation, is this spoken from the perspective of comparing the two positions of cause and effect? Or it explains regarding transformation versus transformation.

Question: In the sūtra, regarding clarifying Śākyamuni's causal practices, was the former King Suśāla a wheel-turning king or not? {Composed by Shiki Zōken} Considering both sides. If he was a wheel-turning king, King Suśāla appeared during the semblance period of Buddha Ratnacūḍa. But wheel-turning kings appear during increasing eons - how could he appear during the decreasing eon of the semblance period? From this we know that this King Suśāla was not a wheel-turning king. If this is the case, then in the present sūtra

【Lower section】
it says "There was a city named Wonderful Sound Voice, and at that time that wheel-turning king dwelt there." The sūtra text clearly appears to indicate a wheel-turning king. It is not at all clear. How is this?

My view: Though there are many interpretations, temporarily establishing one person's interpretation: this King Suśāla appeared at the end of an increasing eon, lived long, and reached the time after Ratnacūḍa's extinction. Therefore it does not contradict the doctrine of appearing during an increasing eon. {This interpretation is the meaning of Xuanzan volume 4.}

Asking again: Truly though there are many different interpretations, all have difficulties. This interpretation also does not accord with the sūtra text. It says "After that Tathāgata's nirvana, a king appeared named Suśāla." He appears to first appear after Buddha Ratnacūḍa's extinction. Does it not appear completely different from originally being a wheel-turning king?

Objection: Provisional manifestations necessarily lead to the real {Someone says: Perhaps a provisional manifestation wheel-turning king}. If the real category does not appear during decreasing eons, how would provisional ones appear during decreasing eons? Moreover, the sūtra text says "There was a city named Wonderful Sound Voice." Following the sūtra text, it appears real.

Xuanzan 4 says: "Question: If during decreasing eons buddhas appear in the world, but during increasing eons wheel-turning kings appear, why are Śaṅkha and Maitreya in the same age? Answer: Śaṅkha appears during increasing times, and because his life is long, he encounters Maitreya."

Question: Regarding the different natures of bodhisattvas, among bodhisattvas who have entered the grounds, are there types who fear afflictions or not? Considering both sides. If there are, generally speaking, examining ground-level bodhisattvas, once the uncontaminated true wisdom turns and realizes the equality of dharma-nature, afterward in the subsequent-attainment contemplation, they develop understanding of all practices as illusion-like. The defilements of afflictions, karma, and birth are already insubstantial. There should completely be no meaning of fearing afflictions.

Based on this, the Great Master says elsewhere {Pivot Essentials 10}: "Bodhisattvas before the seventh ground only manifestly take rebirth for nurturing purposes." If during birth-and-death rebirth they similarly manifest afflictions provisionally, could they receive the designation of fearing afflictions? If based on this there are none, then in the present sūtra commentary: "How do they establish distinctions of wisdom-predominant, compassion-predominant, and fearing or not fearing afflictions?" This explanation clearly shows there are types who fear afflictions. How is this? One person's interpretation says: According to nature, having distinctions of fearing or not fearing afflictions is limited to pre-ground stages and does not extend to ground levels. However, regarding the present commentary's explanation, since ground-level bodhisattvas actually understand the principle of dependent nature as illusion-like, although no bodhisattvas have the meaning of fearing afflictions, according to the appropriateness of the faculties of those to be taught, sometimes they arouse afflictions for long periods, sometimes they arouse afflictions for short periods. This category that arouses afflictions for short periods, though not fearing afflictions, because it is a short time, compared to long periods, provisionally speaks of "fearing afflictions" in terms of meaning.

Inquiry: If arousing afflictions is for short periods and they actually do not fear afflictions, why is it said there is transcending eons in comparison?

Response: This matter is unclear. Temporarily establishing it: arousing afflictions in order to transform and liberate sentient beings. Because the meaning of benefiting others is superior, the practices and vows of dual benefit are sufficient. Since arousing afflictions is for short periods, it is perhaps inferior compared to that.

The Commentary on the Sūtra of Ascending to Heaven, volume 1, says: "However, when bodhisattvas receive transformation bodies, some receive transformation bodies from the first ground onward, like entering cessation concentration, because they fear afflictions. Some only receive transformation bodies when they reach the fulfillment of the tenth ground, like entering cessation concentration, because they do not fear delusions. Once that transformation body is attained, it is not abandoned."

Question: In this volume's sūtra: "If there are faithful good men and good women who desire, regarding past, future, and present buddhas..." Does this text explain deliberative thought? The commentary says "it does not explain this." Regarding this, according to the explanation, examining the sūtra text: "If there are faithful good men and good women who desire to make offerings to past, future, and present buddhas with inconceivable, vast, and sublime offering materials, and desire to understand the profound spheres of practice of the three periods' buddhas." This text clearly explains deliberative thought. If this text does not explain deliberative thought, how could it be called decisive thought? Then the commentary master's determination that "deliberative thought is remote and inferior, so it is briefly not explained" is unclear. How is this?

My view: Truly this doubt is most difficult to resolve. Before reaching decisive mind, first having the thought of making offerings to the buddhas of the three periods and wanting to understand profound dharmas is undoubtedly deliberative thought. Does the sequence of the sūtra text specifically clarify this meaning? However, reconciling it in one way: like the doubt and difficulty, the text "if there are faithful ones, etc." should be deliberative thought, so generally speaking about the sūtra text, it completely explains the three thoughts. The present meaning of "deliberative thought is remote and inferior, so briefly not explained" explains the sūtra text's "decisive sincere mind." That is, "decisive" is decisive thought. "Sincere mind" is focused mindfulness. Focused mindfulness is decisive mind and the superior motivating thought that is right practice. This present "sincere mind" encompasses two thoughts and does not include deliberative thought. That is remote and inferior, so it is briefly not explained. It does not generally say the sūtra text does not explain it. Clarifying preparatory practice and main practice: preparatory practice is decisive thought, main practice is superior motivating thought. Therefore there is no fault.

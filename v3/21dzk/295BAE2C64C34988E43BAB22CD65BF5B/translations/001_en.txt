Volume One
Question: Regarding the causes for the arising of this sūtra, specifically about the particular causes for arising, how does Master Cízhōu explain this?
Response: The commentary states: "Particular means limited to this teaching" etc. Regarding this, looking at the six particular causes for arising below, it teaches the removal of unwholesome causes and effects and the achievement of heavenly and human pleasant results. This principle exists in all great and small teachings. How can it be limited to this sūtra?

Question: Regarding the causes for the arising of this sūtra, specifically about the particular causes for arising, how does Master Cízhōu explain this?
Response: The particular causes for arising are limited only to this sūtra. Namely, the Tathāgata's Lifespan chapter, the merits of the three bodies, and the chapter on eliminating karmic obstacles. Regarding this, teaching confession of phenomena and principle to eliminate sinful obstacles appears in the Samantabhadra Contemplation Sūtra. The Tathāgata's lifespan and three-body merits appear in the Lifespan chapter of the Lotus Sūtra. How can such a judgment be made?

Question: Regarding distinguishing between general and specific introductions using the seven perfections, how is the second samādhi perfection judged?
Response: The first 《introduction perfection》 and third 《audience perfection》 are called general introduction, also called testimony introduction. The rest are specific introductions, etc. Regarding this, considering the general and specific introductions, those common to other sūtras are called general introductions, and those limited to this sūtra are called specific introductions. However, other sūtras like the Lotus and Benevolent King also have matters such as entering samādhi. They should certainly be called general introductions. Why are they called specific introductions? Moreover, the third audience perfection is already a general introduction. Why is the second not so? Based on this, Chinese masters call from "Thus have I heard" to "supreme wonderful dharma"

【Lower Section】
the general introduction, and from "At that time the Blessed One" onward the specific introduction. In the meaning of this sūtra, samādhi perfection exists within "Thus have I heard" through "supreme wonderful dharma," so this difficulty arises.

I say: A certain commentary states that matters of entering samādhi in the Lotus, Benevolent King, etc., are partial, not comprehensive. Therefore they are called specific introductions.

Also states: The commentary clarifies the particular causes for arising and presents six reasons. First, clarifying the fruits of bodhi, nirvana, and the outflow-free. Second, clarifying the removal of unwholesome causes. Third, enabling escape from unwholesome retribution. Fourth, enabling cultivation of the causes of bodhi, nirvana, and the outflow-free. Fifth, enabling cultivation of conditioned wholesome causes. Sixth, enabling attainment of heavenly and human pleasant fruits, etc. However, other sūtras do not fully clarify these six causes. Therefore, limited to this sūtra, they are called particular causes for arising.

Also, questioning: The commentary explains the sūtra text, making from "Thus have I heard" to "supreme wonderful dharma" the general introduction, and from "At that time the Blessed One" onward the arising introduction. Does this explanation already explain samādhi perfection as general introduction?

I say: This explanation is indeed difficult to reconcile. However, since samādhi perfection exists between introduction perfection and audience perfection, following the preceding and following context, it is judged thus for now.

Further inquiry: Why does samādhi perfection come before audience perfection? Introduction perfection and audience perfection are both general introductions. They should equally be in front.

My reconciliation: This matter is a question and answer in the commentary. The commentary answers this: Since both body and mind dwelling are called dwelling.

Also, due to two principles, they are explained together in one place, etc. However, the textual appearance is extremely obscure; even the ancients found it troublesome, and it's difficult for later scholars to digest. For now, this humble monk's opinion is: introduction perfection clarifies the dwelling place, so it is bodily dwelling. Raising samādhi clarifies the mind's dwelling place. Therefore they are explained in sequence. Next, "also due to two principles, explained together in one place" means: calling the dwelling place mind-dwelling, including samādhi, raising bodily dwelling and presenting it, so both have two principles, therefore they are explained together in one place.

Question: In the commentary clarifying the benefits obtained from this sūtra, dharma-eye purity benefit is presented. Which is it among Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna benefits?
Response: There are two explanations in the commentary; the latter is superior. Judging it as Hīnayāna benefit and explaining it is superior, etc. Regarding this, this sūtra is a Middle Way definitive teaching. The benefits listed should definitely be Mahāyāna benefits. What evidence is there to call them Hīnayāna benefits? Moreover, the Ornament Treatise mentions Mahāyāna benefits, etc. Considering this, the benefits of this sūtra should be Mahāyāna benefits. How then?

I say: Opening the sūtra text and examining the benefits obtained, it describes Mahāyāna benefits: generating supreme bodhi-mind and receiving the prediction of anuttara-bodhi. Following this, in the Fulfilling Vows chapter, besides the benefit of tolerance of non-arising dharmas, dharma-eye purity benefit is raised. One knows it is not a Mahāyāna benefit. Also, opening the Wonderful Sūtra's explanation, describing Mahāyāna benefits: obtaining supreme bodhi, obtaining tolerance of non-arising, obtaining dhāraṇī. These are each distinct. Here in the Yogācāra Treatise, it describes first-fruit attainment benefits. Does Cízhōu's profound view arise from this? This sūtra is a teaching universal to the three vehicles. Are the explanations limited to Mahāyāna benefits? However, regarding the Ornament Treatise's explanation, distant

【Lower Section】
from dust and free from defilement refers to the principle of cutting off delusions. Obtaining dharma-eye purity is the designation of realizing fruition. This principle exists in the Mahāyāna first ground. Therefore, according to the separate principle gate, this explanation is recorded. Based on this, in that treatise, the explanation of ten-ground dharma-eye purity benefits is according to this meaning. The treatise should be examined.

Question: The sūtra text states "among all dharmas, obtained dharma-eye purity," etc. Is this dharma-eye purity benefit obtained in the pure land?
There are arguments on both sides. If obtained in the pure land, the Profound Praise explains it as Hīnayāna benefit. Hīnayāna does not obtain benefits in the pure land. How can this be said? If obtained in the defiled land, according to our school's meaning, the dwelling lands of all chapters from the Medicine King onward are all pure lands. One knows it is obtained in the pure land. Moreover, if accomplished thus, doesn't this not accord with other schools' understanding?

Question: In this sūtra's commentary, dharma-eye purity benefit is presented. Is this benefit limited to Hīnayāna first-fruit benefit?
There are arguments on both sides. If limited to first fruit, realizing dharma-nature true principle and obtaining the outflow-free wisdom eye is called dharma-eye purity. Later stages already have this principle. Why say it's limited to first fruit? Based on this, the Yogācāra Treatise describes it as pervading the four fruits, showing that it pervades later stages. Other treatises' explanations are also thus. If so, then in this commentary and the Profound Praise, it explains as limited to first fruit. How so?
Someone says: Dharma-eye purity benefit means initially cutting off discriminating delusions, called obtaining.

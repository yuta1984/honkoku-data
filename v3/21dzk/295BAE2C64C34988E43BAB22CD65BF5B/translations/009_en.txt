[The commentary] quotes the two types of Tathāgata-garbha explained in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra. If so, among them, does the non-empty Tathāgata-garbha extend to both defiled and undefiled seeds, or how should this be understood? [Examining] both sides. If it extends [to both], looking at the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra text, it says "because of complete perfuming and undefiled dharmas." The sutra text clearly limits [this to] undefiled seeds. Accordingly, Master Heung of Silla judged [it as] only undefiled seeds. If this is so, in the present commentary it says "[extending to] both defiled and undefiled seeds." How should this be understood?

I say: This non-empty Tathāgata-garbha should be limited to undefiled seeds. The defiled is illusory, and the undefiled is separate from it. Limiting [it to] the undefiled - this principle has no dispute. Here, the text immediately above in this commentary explains it thus. Additionally, in the commentary below it says "wisdom-nature exists from beginningless [time]; in the causal stage it is called non-empty Tathāgata-garbha; in the fruition stage it is called great bodhi." The intent of this explanation appears to limit [it to] the undefiled. However, regarding the present commentary's explanation, the text immediately above already explained it as limited to the undefiled. The wording is not extensive. One cannot say it extends to the defiled. Therefore, the intent of this present explanation is that in the eighth consciousness, among the complete possession of both defiled and undefiled seeds, because [it] perfumes undefiled dharmas, it is called non-empty Tathāgata-garbha. The meaning is that among the complete [seeds], because [it] perfumes undefiled dharmas. Therefore there is no fault.

The commentary says: "The defiled eighth consciousness is called empty store because it is illusory. The undefiled various seeds in consciousness are called non-empty Tathāgata-garbha because they are separate from illusion."

Question: In the sutra, regarding the ten grounds from Joy, etc., it "cuts off ten types of obstructions." If so, is the obstruction to benefiting sentient beings cut off at the first ground, or is it cut off at the second ground? [Examining] both sides. If it is cut off at the second ground, when cutting off the two obstructions of discrimination and entering the holy nature separate from birth, one obtains same-essence compassion and gains mastery regarding benefiting sentient beings. Cutting off the obstruction to benefiting sentient beings should definitely be a virtue of the first ground. Moreover, looking at the present text of the sutra, it says "depending on first ground mind, eliminate the obstruction to benefiting sentient beings." Accordingly, Master Heung of Silla's interpretation follows the sutra text. If this is so, then regarding restlessness and regret being the obstruction of ordinary being nature cut off at the first ground, if the obstruction to benefiting sentient beings is also cut off [there], would there be grounds among the latter nine grounds that do not cut off obstructions? Here, Master Zizhou, following Master Shengzhuang's understanding, judges [it as] what is cut off at the Ground of Freedom from Defilement. Both sides are unclear. How should this be understood?

I say: The doctrinal path of the sutra text has different aspects, and its meaning is difficult to maintain. However, according to Zizhou's interpretation, truly at the first ground, although same-essence compassion is obtained, regarding matters of benefiting sentient beings, [one] cannot reach [the level of] the second ground. The reason is that when accomplishing the perfection of morality and cutting off the obstruction of wrong conduct, [one] separates from mistaken violations of the three karmas and does not cause harm or vexation to sentient beings. The first ground does not have this meaning. How could it cut off [this obstruction]? Moreover, regarding the ten grounds and Buddha ground, eleven obstructions are established. If the obstruction to benefiting sentient beings is not the second ground's obstruction, there would be the fault of insufficient eleven obstructions, and there would be grounds that do not cut off obstructions. However, regarding the text "depending on first ground mind, eliminate the obstruction to benefiting sentient beings," at the first ground [one] suppresses this obstruction, therefore entering the second ground [one] properly cuts it off. "Depending on first ground mind" reveals suppression; "eliminate the obstruction to benefiting sentient beings" mentions proper cutting off. The sutra text has deep intent. Other masters perhaps do not know this. Through the power of the previous path, [one] suppresses the

mind of the latter ground. This is the intent of the reasonable explanation among the commentary's two explanations.

Further inquiry: This present reasonable explanation is unclear in various ways. That the text "depending on first ground mind" reveals the suppressive path is reasonable to some extent. Next, "obtaining entry into the second ground, in this ground eliminate the non-oppressive-vexation obstruction" - "this ground" refers to the second ground above. If it refers to the above, eliminating the non-oppressive-vexation obstruction should undoubtedly be [at] the second ground. Looking at this, should eliminating the obstruction to benefiting sentient beings be [at] the first ground? Moreover, if "in this ground" does not belong to the next above, then in the lower [text] "entering the ten grounds, in this ground," should "this ground" belong to the later Buddha ground? If so, could Buddha fruit obstructions not be said to be cut off by causal stage wisdom? Next, the obstruction to seeing conventional and ultimate should be a fifth ground obstruction, because at the fifth ground there is combined observation of conventional and ultimate. The intent of this explanation should belong to sixth ground obstructions. This is also one doubt. The obstruction to not seeing cessation characteristics and the obstruction to not seeing arising characteristics should be investigated.

Resolution: "In this ground" should be the same as "depending on first ground mind" - depending on second ground mind, [one] suppresses it. Who said that the second ground refers to later grounds? Therefore, the text "in this ground eliminate knowledge obstructions" coming [here] should not be made a difficulty. Next, regarding the obstruction to seeing conventional and ultimate, the commentary has two explanations, which should be consulted.

Further inquiry: The obstruction of unwillingness to practice among benefiting others is cut off at the ninth ground. Why is the obstruction to benefiting sentient beings cut off at the second ground?

【Lower section】
I say: This should be resolved through the meaning of coarse-subtle and shallow-deep.

Question: In this volume's commentary, clarifying the obstructions cut off by the ten grounds, it makes two explanations - following principle and following text. If so, how does the commentary master explain the obstruction cut off by the ninth ground? Response: The commentary explains the ancient translation sutra text: at the first ground cut off the restlessness-regret obstruction, up to the tenth ground breaking the knowledge obstruction, hiding the obstruction of unwillingness to practice among benefiting others cut off at the ninth ground and not discussing it. Regarding this, establishing multiple interpretations depends on doctrinal paths being mutually concordant. However, examining the ancient translation sutra text, [it says] the first ground eliminates the obstruction to benefiting sentient beings, up to the ninth ground breaking the six spiritual power obstructions, the tenth ground separating from knowledge obstructions. The matter of matching ten grounds with ten obstructions is already a clear mirror in the sutra text. The explanation forcibly hiding ninth ground obstructions is perhaps interpretation outside the text. Even if not the actual intended meaning, how does it accord with the text in general? The matter of it being a text-following explanation is unclear. How should this be understood?

I say: Truly this doubt and difficulty is hard to resolve. Tentatively resolving it, examining that sutra text: "Depending on the first ground, extract benefit obstructions; having extracted benefit obstructions, obtain entry into the second ground." The meaning is that at the first ground, having finished cutting off obstructions to benefiting sentient beings, [one] enters the second ground. In the sutra text, the first ground appears as the proper cutting-off path for obstructions to benefiting sentient beings. Why call it a suppressive path? Cutting off obstructions comes first, and the ground entered comes later. Therefore below [it says] "break not seeing arising characteristics; having broken not seeing arising characteristics, enter the ninth ground." Cutting off the obstruction of not seeing characteristic-arising is at the previous ground's eighth [stage], and entering the ninth ground is the later ground. The obstruction of not seeing arising characteristics is not cut off by the ninth ground. Six spiritual power obstructions are also not cut off by the ninth ground.

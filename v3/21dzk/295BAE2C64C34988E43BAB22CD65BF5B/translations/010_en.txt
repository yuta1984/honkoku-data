Regarding the great spiritual power ignorance, the Vijñānavāda treatise states it is cut off at the tenth ground. Since the six spiritual power obstructions are not cut off at the ninth ground, [the commentary] hides the ninth ground's obstructions and does not discuss them. The matter of "following the text" probably depends on the previous text.

Question: In the present sutra, the Dharma-body is manifested by the two emptinesses of persons and phenomena. If so, how does the commentary master explain the distinction between the two emptinesses of persons and phenomena? Response: Objects are dharma-emptiness; wisdom is person-emptiness. Regarding this: emptying self-attachment is called person-emptiness, emptying dharma-attachment is called dharma-emptiness. In objective realms and subjective wisdom, both should have the two emptinesses of persons and phenomena. Why distinguish the two emptinesses based on the subjective perceiver? How should this be understood?

I say: Truly, emptying self-attachment and dharma-attachment should exist in both objective and subjective aspects. Here, in the text immediately above, clarifying the two non-existences: first, object non-existence; second, wisdom non-existence. The two non-existences are the two emptinesses of persons and phenomena. Already clarifying these two non-existences in both subjective and objective aspects. Know that Master Zizhou's actual doctrine holds that both wisdom and objects should have this meaning. However, regarding the commentary's explanation "objects are dharma-emptiness; wisdom is person-emptiness," to reveal the meaning that self-attachment mind arises depending on dharma-attachment, [it] temporarily makes this correspondence. The meaning is: dharma-attachment is the basis, self-attachment is what depends. And wisdom arises depending on objects. Therefore objects are the basis, wisdom is what depends. Here, matching the basic dharma-attachment with the basic object - objects empty dharma-attachment; matching the dependent wisdom with wisdom - [it] empties person-emptiness. This is exactly the next text below: "The personal self arises depending on dharma-attachment, like mistaking a post," etc. Does the commentary's intent before and after appear reasonable?

Question: The sutra text says "there is only suchness and suchness-wisdom." If so, how should this be judged regarding the two benefits? Response: The sutra says: suchness is self-benefit; suchness-wisdom is benefiting others. Regarding this: suchness is the true principle of dharma-nature, serving as the basis for enjoyment and transformation [bodies], therefore both should have the meaning of two benefits. Accordingly, in the Abhidharma and Vijñānavāda, the self-nature body is established as dharma of two benefits. Next, suchness-wisdom is the self-enjoyment body, belonging only to the self-benefit body. Why call it benefiting others? If so, how should this be understood?

I say: Regarding the three bodies accompanying self-benefit and benefiting others, there are three differences. First, in Abhidharma and Vijñānavāda: the dharma-body encompasses both benefits; the self-enjoyment body is self-benefit; other-enjoyment and transformation [bodies] benefit others. Second, in the Anuttara-āśraya Sutra and Dharmatā-śāstra: the dharma-body is self-benefit; response and transformation [bodies] benefit others. Third, in the present sutra, the dharma-body's self-benefit is explained based on the majority [aspect]. The self-enjoyment body's benefiting others is because it serves as the basis for the other-enjoyment and transformation bodies, hence called thus. If discussing actual principle, explaining it like the Abhidharma and Vijñānavāda has no fault. This should be established according to the commentary's intent and consulted.

Question: In the present sutra, the merits of the thirty-two marks and eighty minor characteristics are clarified. If so, can the Brahma voice mark be said to excel the invisible crown mark? Response: Master Puyang explains it as excelling. Regarding this: according to the explanation, examining the Yogācāra treatise's teaching, the white tuft mark and invisible crown mark, when compared to various marks, have karmic causes superior to various marks. When the white tuft and invisible crown marks are

compared relatively, the invisible crown's causative capability is stated to excel. When determining the superiority and inferiority of causative karmic causes, the Brahma voice mark is already an inferior entity among the various marks. Considering the causative causes, definitely the invisible crown mark should excel. If so, how should this be understood?

Someone says: There should be aspects on both sides. Since the Buddha expounds the dharma with one voice, etc., the Brahma voice mark excels. Also, since it is not seen by the eye, the invisible crown mark can be said to excel.

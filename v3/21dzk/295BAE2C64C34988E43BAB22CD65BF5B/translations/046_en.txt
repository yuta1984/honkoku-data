Regarding this, through the power of meditative concentration and vows' perfuming and cultivation, one aids the karmic causes of impure lands and attains the eighth consciousness of pure lands. This is like aiding karmic actions of the divided [lifespans] to receive transformational birth, or aiding the ancient karma of lower heavens to be born in the Five Pure Abodes. In cases of supremely excellent practice and vow power, one should not forcefully apply separate principles. Next, regarding the text "according to the purity of mind, there are then pure Buddha lands," this discusses the fundamental buddha-land - because the Tathāgata's mind is pure, the transformed lands are pure. This is not about the transformed bodhisattvas. Next, regarding the presence or absence of naturally inherent karmic seeds, scholars' preferences differ. If one maintains the position of non-existence, such doubts and criticisms are useless. However, even maintaining the position of existence, there should not be strong contradiction. That originally existing karmic seeds and name-and-form seeds produce results all has its reasons. That is, when generating the ignorance that creates karma and producing simultaneous action-supports, depending on the power of ignorance-supports, either newly perfuming action-support seeds or increasing naturally inherent karmic seeds. These newly perfumed and originally existing good and evil karmic seeds draw the neutral original and newly [formed] two types of seeds of the fifth support of consciousness in the same location, making future fruition certain. Therefore, even if there were naturally inherent karmic seeds of pure lands, if ignorance-supports of the same stage do not arise, how could they produce fruit? Moreover, having naturally inherent karmic seeds refers to the three realms and nine stages - for lands transcending the three realms, these should not exist. Next, regarding cultivating the karmic causes of pure Buddha lands during the first incalculable eon, the Yogācāra treatise states that pure worlds are where above-stage bodhisattvas are born. Generally, bodhisattvas of the first stage and above realize the true principle of two emptinesses, attain supreme non-outflows, their merit gradually excels, and their marks become increasingly clear. Depending on the power of merit, their bodily dimensions are suitable for that land, and moreover that land is like an illusory land. Since post-first-stage bodhisattvas understand the illusory nature, it is where those bodhisattvas are born.

Pre-stage ordinary-position bodhisattvas lack this meaning. How could they be born in that land? Creating karma is not something that exists generally. One creates karma for lands where one should be born, and if that land is already not a land where one should be born, how could one create that karma? Moreover, when ignorance of the same stage arises, it draws forth action-supports of the same stage, perfumes karmic seeds and name-and-form seeds, making fruition certain. Regarding pure worlds, this meaning does not exist. How could one create that karma in ordinary positions? This matter is like the karmic causes of Pure Abode heavens. However, being in pre-stages and cultivating causes of pure Buddha lands means that even if not directly creating that karma, depending on these karmic causes, upon reaching above-stages, one experiences the general retribution of human and heavenly [realms]. Though those karmic causes are impure land karma, being aided by meditative concentration and vow perfuming, they become the eighth consciousness of pure lands. Therefore one cultivates causes of pure Buddha lands. Next, regarding the criticism that ordinary beings should transform into pure [lands], now through the power of meditative concentration and vow perfuming, one aids impure land karma and experiences the eighth consciousness of pure lands. Other masters' understanding does not know such principles and only transforms into other regions and this realm, thus raising this criticism and refutation.

Question: In the present sūtra commentary, regarding clarifying Buddha's fruition merits, can the principle of the One True Dharma Realm be called what Buddha's wisdom practices? From both perspectives: If it is what Buddha's wisdom practices, the One True Dharma Realm is a doctrine that abandons verbal designation. It should not be called a realm, should not be called what is practiced. How can it be called what Buddha's wisdom practices? Based on this, the Great Master explained "because it is a doctrine abandoning verbal designation and not a realm." Cīzhou, explaining the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra text "because it is the realm of internal realization and sacred practice," stated "a doctrine relying on verbal designation, because it separates from mind-associated essence, it is the realm of internal realization and sacred practice," etc. These explanations clearly show it is not what Buddha's wisdom practices. If following this, then in the present commentary it states "the One True Dharma Realm is the realm of Buddha's practice," etc. How is this?

Someone says: The fourth ultimate meaning is the principle-nature of One Real True Suchness. In both horizontal and vertical approaches, it penetrates the realm of principles. If following the meaning of interdependence between conventional and ultimate, when discussing vertically, because it is a doctrine depending on verbal designation, it is called what sacred wisdom realizes and said to have the meaning of being a realm. Based on this aspect of meaning, the present treatise states "this is the supreme path, because it has the meaning of what is practiced." If discussing horizontally, when abandoning the meaning of interdependence between conventional and ultimate, because it abandons verbal designation as doctrine, principles are called ultimate meaning. The Forest of Meanings of the Two Truths reveals this aspect of meaning.

Question: In the sūtra text clarifying the meaning of bodhisattvas praising Śākyamuni, do all bodhisattvas of this land praise the Tathāgata? From both perspectives: If not all praise, even bodhisattvas of other lands from ten directions still praise Śākyamuni. How could bodhisattvas of our own realm not all praise? If following this interpretation, examining the sūtra text, praise is limited to Wonderful Banner. We know other bodhisattvas do not praise. How is this?

In my opinion, why must all bodhisattvas of this land necessarily praise? Since Wonderful Banner is the leader of this land, he alone praises. The commentary stating "because he is the leader" expresses this meaning. However, bodhisattvas coming from other directions, visiting Vulture Peak, should not be purposeless. Therefore they all praise. The situations should not be equated.

Inquiring further: If the leader praises and companions do not, should there also be leaders and companions in other lands? Moreover, bodhisattvas of this land should also not be purposeless, being like bodhisattvas of other lands, so criticism by analogy could still exist.

【Lower section】
Reconciling this: How could the Great Sage's skillful adaptations be uniform? Following the times and depending on circumstances, in this land the difference between leader and companions is shown, making people believe in Wonderful Banner being the leader, so companions do not praise. Since leaders of other lands' bodhisattvas praise, showing the meaning of companions following leaders, both leaders and companions praise together. When preaching the Lotus, bodhisattvas from below, Many Treasures, and emanation bodies all pay homage. Wonderful Voice does not pay homage to emanation bodies. Such skillful means for benefiting beings follow what is appropriate.

Question: The sūtra text states "paying homage to the Tathāgata's pure wisdom," etc. Then among the three bodies, which body is being paid homage to? Proceeding to say: The commentary states "it penetrates both dharma and reward bodies," etc. Regarding this: Since it already says "pure wisdom," it should only be limited to the reward body, because the Four Wisdoms of Bodhi should be called pure wisdom. If, based on the mind that combines wisdom-characteristics and wisdom-nature to be collectively called wisdom, it penetrates the dharma body, then the text of three lines like "paying homage, constantly seeking correct dharma wisdom" should definitely penetrate the dharma body. If so, what evidence is there that the first line penetrates the dharma body while the latter three lines refer to the reward body? Here, masters of Tang China say this entire verse all pays homage to the wisdom dharma body. How is this?

In my opinion, the commentary explains the present word "pure" as "wisdom free from obstacles is perfect, called pure wisdom," etc. Cutting off delusions necessarily depends on realizing principle, so cutting off delusions has its source in principle. Being pure should most appropriately exist in principle. Establishing the name "wisdom" upon principle is a constant practice. The present sūtra states "the Tathāgata's wisdom ocean is without limit" and "taking refuge in the great wisdom ocean." Are these not all explaining the dharma body? Here the old translated sūtra states "Homage to purity, supreme correct awakening, profound wonderful dharma," etc. Saying "profound wonderful dharma" is

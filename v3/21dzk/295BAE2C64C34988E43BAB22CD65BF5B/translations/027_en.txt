Vehicle and revere the Great Vehicle." This text and Cízhōu's explanation appear to show it was explained after the Lotus Sutra.
If following this as a later explanation, Paramārtha Tripiṭaka determined that it was explained simultaneously with the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra in the thirty-eighth year after Buddha's enlightenment. Moreover, the tenth volume of the present sutra states: Kāśyapa says of himself, "I have little wisdom and according to my ability propagate this sutra." If it was explained after the Lotus Sutra, since at the time of that sutra he had already turned his mind toward the Great Vehicle, why does he speak of "little wisdom" at the time of this sutra? How should this be understood?

In my view: Following the sutra text, it should be called a post-Lotus explanation. However, regarding Kāśyapa referring to himself as having little wisdom, Yóuxīn resolves this saying: Because Kāśyapa is humble about himself, he says "I am one of little wisdom, etc." Following this explanation there is no problem. Next, Paramārtha's explanation should probably not be used.
　　This doctrinal question is extensively annotated in the first volume. It should be examined.

Question: The sutra text states "able to abide well and able to receive and maintain correctly." How does the commentary master explain this? It continues: "Able to abide well" means taking this mantra as support. "Able to receive correctly" is hearing wisdom. "Maintain" is the two wisdoms of reflection and cultivation. Regarding this, according to this explanation when examining the sutra text, these two sentences in the sutra should explain the three wisdoms of hearing, reflection, and cultivation. Namely, "able to abide well" is hearing wisdom, "able to receive correctly" is reflection wisdom, and "maintain" is cultivation wisdom. For example, the Buddhabhūmi-śāstra states "able to bear, able to reflect, able to maintain" as the three wisdoms in sequence. How should this be understood?

In my view: Taking this divine mantra as support, the three wisdoms arise. Therefore it is called "able to abide." "Abiding" has the meaning of depending upon. Why would hearing wisdom suddenly be called "abiding"? If the first sentence is not hearing wisdom, then matching the next sentence to the three wisdoms would be quite reasonable. "Bear, reflect, maintain" is not similar to this. Is this not an example?

Also, someone doubts: When the Lotus Sutra's five kinds of dharma teacher practices take "receiving and maintaining" as one practice, why is this now called separate practices?
Explaining: "Receiving" refers to accepting and grasping. "Maintaining" refers to holding and supporting. According to different doctrinal approaches, why should there be uniformity?

Question: When using dhāraṇī to follow the metaphor and call it the "Wish-fulfilling Jewel Chapter," should it be included in the six kinds of compound analysis? It continues: The commentary states it is not included in the six kinds of compound analysis. Regarding this, when using dharma to follow metaphor as a chapter title, why is it not one of the six kinds of compounds? Shouldn't there be the two analyses of karmadhāraya and bahuvrīhi compounds? How is this?

In my view: When combining to say "Wish-fulfilling Jewel Chapter," there should be the two analyses of karmadhāraya and bahuvrīhi compounds. If only saying "wish-fulfilling jewel," then it is said not to be one of the six kinds of compounds. Or alternatively, "wish-fulfilling jewel" is metaphor and "chapter" is dharma. In relation to metaphor, how can the six compound analyses be discussed?

Question: Are the wish-fulfilling jewel explained by Vaiśravaṇa in the Nation-Protecting Chapter and the wish-fulfilling jewel explained in this chapter the same or different? It continues: The commentary states: "Same name, different meaning." Regarding this, examining the sutra texts of both, they both explain the meaning of removing disasters and giving happiness, and equally reveal the purpose of protecting those who propagate the sutra. Why is their meaning said to be different?

In my view: The present commentary's explanation is profound. Examining Master Xìng's commentary explanation, what is explained in the Nation-Protecting Chapter clarifies the benefits of maintaining the sutra, while what is explained in this chapter describes the benefits obtained from propagating the sutra. Therefore they are different.

Question: Should the wish-fulfilling divine mantra of the Nation-Protecting Chapter be explained by the four heavenly kings together? Answer: The commentary states: "Explained together by the four kings." Regarding this, examining the present text of the sutra, only Vaiśravaṇa alone explains it. Why is it called "explained by the four kings"? Moreover, the previous commentary determined it as "explained by one alone." The front and back are contradictory. How is this?

In my view: The previous commentary states: "In the Nation-Protecting Chapter, desiring to make single-minded prayer easy to accomplish, therefore the mantra is explained by only one." The meaning is: if the four kings were all to explain it, sentient beings to be converted would have scattered minds and prayer would be difficult to accomplish. Therefore when one deva explains it, single-minded prayer becomes easy to accomplish. Therefore one deva explains it. In reality, the four kings all explain it together.

Asking again: If so, one deva should explain it from beginning to end. Why is it said that the four kings explain it?
Explaining: The spiritual capacities of those to be converted are of a thousand varieties. There may be those who hear what all four kings explain and accomplish prayer.

Question: The sutra text states: "Benefit their wisdom with perfect adornment of eloquent speech." Then within this text, which of the four kinds of eloquence does it explain? It continues: The commentary states it is eloquence of words. Regarding this, this text should fully explain the four kinds of eloquence. Namely, "benefit their wisdom" refers to the two eloquences of dharma and meaning. "Perfect adornment" refers to the eloquence of skillful explanation. "Eloquent speech" refers to eloquence of words. According to this, other masters explain it like this. Then the explanation is not clear. How is this?

In my view: Benefiting their wisdom is for the purpose of perfecting and adorning eloquence of words. Perfect adornment

is also eloquence of words. Therefore what is properly explained is called eloquence of words. Thus there is no problem.

Question: The sutra text states: "Swift eloquence, inexhaustible great wisdom, good understanding of various treatises and all arts and skills." Then should this text be said to explain the four eloquences and the five sciences including logic? It continues: The commentary's intention explains the four eloquences and seven eloquences, but does not explain the five sciences. Regarding this, examining the sutra text, it should broadly clarify the four eloquences and five sciences. Namely, "swift eloquence" refers to skillful explanation and word eloquence. "Inexhaustible great wisdom" refers to the two eloquences of dharma and meaning. The seven eloquences are distinctions within the eloquence of skillful explanation. "And various arts and skills" refers to the science of crafts. "Good understanding of various treatises" refers to the other four sciences. According to this, Master Xìng explains it like this. Then the explanation is not clear. How is this?

In my view: "Swift eloquence and inexhaustible great wisdom" refers to the four eloquences and seven eloquences. Because among the seven eloquences there is uninterrupted eloquence. "Good understanding of various treatises" refers to the two eloquences of dharma and meaning. Therefore from "good understanding of various treatises" and above explains the four eloquences and seven eloquences. Regarding "and various arts and skills," one should not prevent clarifying phonetics, crafts, and medical sciences. What is called "arts and skills" refers precisely to these. Why does the commentary explanation say it is limited to the four eloquences and seven eloquences? However, other masters explaining "good understanding of various treatises" as the other four sciences probably does not accord with the text. "And various arts and skills" refers to three sciences.

Question: The sutra text states: "The World-Honored One protects and is mindful, explaining the teaching." Then this one verse explains the four total retentions. How should it be analyzed and explained? It continues: The commentary states: "The first half-verse reveals the three total retentions of dharma, patience, and mantra. The next half-verse explains meaning retention." Regarding this, in one verse of four lines of text, each line

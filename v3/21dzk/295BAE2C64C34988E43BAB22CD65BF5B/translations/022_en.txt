In my view: Both explanations have their logic. First, regarding the initial explanation's intention: isn't the golden color of the body's light dependent on the golden skin color? Therefore it praises the golden skin color characteristic. Next, regarding "World Honored One's supreme body golden color," the commentary explains this as "praising together." The meaning is that above, separately within the body parts, one part praises the skin, while below generally praises the body parts. This is because body parts include bones, etc. The intention of the next explanation: in praising the constant light, there are respective meanings. This is compared to golden color, while below, being one fathom, manifests compassion for sentient beings. Though both are constant light, they merely express different virtues.

Question: In the sūtra's clarification of the principle of emptiness, besides conditioned emptiness and unconditioned emptiness, can conditioned-unconditioned emptiness be established? Answer: It is not established. Regarding this, in the present commentary, besides internal emptiness and external emptiness, internal-external emptiness is established as a judgment. By analogy, couldn't conditioned-unconditioned emptiness be established? Moreover, regarding conditioned and unconditioned dharmas, there should be attachment to separation and combination. Why not establish conditioned-unconditioned emptiness through combination?

In my view: In the present commentary, clarifying internal-external emptiness appears to have two meanings. First, creating regarding dharma essence. That is, regarding the four great elements that create the five sense faculties and supporting matter, there are two meanings: creating internal faculties and creating external supporting matter. Therefore it is called internal-external emptiness. Second, internal emptiness and external emptiness are observed separately, and also observed in total combination, called internal-external emptiness. Regarding these two meanings, when responding to the analogical objection, when discussing regarding dharma essence, internal-external emptiness has dharma essence. Its essence is precisely the four great elements. However, besides conditioned emptiness and unconditioned emptiness, the so-called conditioned-unconditioned emptiness through combination has no dharma essence.

How can this be established? Next, when observing in total combination, conditioned-unconditioned emptiness should also exist. Therefore the Chapter on Emptiness judges: "It doesn't say 'only explained.' Principle also has no harm." This is that intention. The meaning is it doesn't say "only establishing internal-external emptiness alone." Principle also permits this without fault. Not obstructing the non-establishment of conditioned-unconditioned emptiness, perhaps explaining that permitting this is without fault. However, that chapter uses two meanings to explain the matter of non-establishment, explaining matters not taught in the teachings. It's not saying the teachings don't permit it.

The Chapter on Emptiness states: Question: Why do internal and external immediately separate and combine for observation, while existent and non-existent do not do so? Answer: It doesn't say "only explained." Principle also has no harm. Internal and external dharmas are both conditioned. Combined observation is easy. Conditioned and unconditioned - combined observation is difficult. Therefore it's not explained. Also, grasping internal and external dharmas, separation and combination have self and possessions. Scattered observation of separation and combination destroys that grasping. Conditioned and unconditioned dharmas are not so. Therefore there is no combination.

Question: The sūtra text states "with different mouths but same voice praising the dharma master saying..." Then is this dharma master limited to the offering dharma master, or how should it be understood? Proceeding to say: The commentary states: "Including the dharma master who expounds is the correct meaning." Regarding this, according to the commentary master's explanation, examining the sūtra text from beginning to end: when the human king offers various incense to make offerings to this wonderful canon, the incense clouds reach the ten directions' Ganges sand buddha lands, transforming in the space realm into incense canopies. The buddhas observe the auspicious response, with different mouths but same voice praising the offering dharma master: "Excellent! Excellent! You great hero, widely propagate such profound and subtle sūtra texts." The sūtra text clearly appears to limit this to the offering dharma master. Moreover, the text praising future results also limits this to the offering dharma master. Why does the explanation of praising present causes include the expounding dharma master? According to this, the master's definitive judgment follows the sūtra text. How should this be understood?

In my view: Master Cízhōu made two explanations, judging that the explanation including both types of dharma masters is superior. Generally, this explanation's meaning is that the auspicious sign of incense clouds pervading the ten directions depends on the merit power of the human king's offering to the sūtra. Also, the one who expounds, by proclaiming the sūtra, has the sūtra king's威power, causing it to pervade the ten directions. Therefore it includes both types of dharma masters. However, regarding the objection that the text explaining future results limits this to the offering dharma master: understanding that the explanation praising present causes includes the expounding dharma master, the future

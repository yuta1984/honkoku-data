There is no reason for transcending eons. Therefore, it merely becomes excellent practice and does not reach eon transcending. However, saying "transcends six eons" or "transcends nine eons" should be transformation-manifestation transcending. If it were not real, it could not constitute a contradiction.

Asking again: Why are things like transcending six eons transformation-manifestation transcending, while forty eons is actual fact?

Explanation: That transcending forty eons is actual fact means that Maitreya had arousal of aspiration forty eons before Śākyamuni. Śākyamuni transcended forty eons and attained buddhahood before Maitreya. Therefore, that is real transcending. Other transcendings have no such reason, so they are called transformation-manifestation transcending.

Question: In this commentary, prophecy differentiations are not clarified, but can the essence of what is prophesied encompass the three bodies of Dharma, Reward, and Transformation? The commentary says "excluding the Dharma-nature body," etc. Regarding this, since the prophesied essence is already untainted wholesome dharmas, shouldn't it most definitely extend to the three bodies? Moreover, when clarifying the basis of what is prophesied, differential hidden prophecy and equal aspiration also extend to those of fixed nature and those without nature. Regarding attaining fruition, why exclude the self-nature body? It is said that causes are attained, so shouldn't it definitely extend to that? Regarding the text "All sentient beings possess Buddha-nature and shall all attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi," the Buddha-Land Treatise judges this as "spoken based on inherent nature." How is this? {Composed by Shiki Yūben}

My view: Regarding the prophesied essence, there are many differentiations such as prophecy time, designation of names, prophecy place, prophecy land, prophecy title, etc. But in the Dharma body, how could there be such differentiations? Therefore, excluding it most definitely has its reason.

The basis of what is prophesied should not serve as an example. Next, regarding the Nirvana Sūtra text, relying on equal intent, without considering differentiations like prophecy lands, it explains the meaning of future buddhahood. Now we distinguish this based on differentiations like prophecy lands, etc. Therefore, we simply exclude it.

Question: The sūtra text says "holding wish-fulfilling maṇi jewels in hand," etc. So are maṇi and wish-fulfilling jewels the same in essence or not? Answer: Whether the two jewels are same or different is difficult to determine definitively. There are two views. If they are one essence, the present sūtra text already lists wish-fulfilling and maṇi separately, raising each distinctly. Clearly we know they are not one essence. If following this they are separate, maṇi is an Indian word; in Chinese lands it's called "wish-fulfilling." This is simply a difference in Sanskrit and Chinese names. Discussing their essence, they are one jewel. Following this, Master Cien elsewhere explains the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra text "composed of maṇi," saying "In Sanskrit called maṇi, in Chinese called wish-fulfilling." {This is like the Dharma King Commentary}

Answer: The Xuanzan commentary on the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra text "composed of maṇi" says "In Sanskrit called maṇi, in Chinese called wish-fulfilling," etc. The Ritual Manual Commentary explanation is also the same. Additionally, Master Zizhou says "cintāmaṇi, in Chinese called wish-fulfilling treasure jewel," etc. So although their essence is one, because there are superior and inferior grades, they are listed separately. Xuanzan 9 says "Although maṇi jewels suit the mind, they are not yet superior. Wish-fulfilling is most superior," etc. The same [volume] 2 says "Maṇi jewels are wish-fulfilling divine jewels," etc. The Ritual Manual Commentary says: "The Comprehensive Explanation says: 'The commentary from maṇi jewels to most superior, etc.: There are jewels of superior and inferior [grades], divided into two types. Some sūtras speak of maṇi wish-fulfilling. This is dual explanation in Chinese and Sanskrit. Because these jewels have different categories, Chinese and Sanskrit

【Page 83】
【Upper section】
dual terminology is to manifest superior and inferior [grades],' etc."

The Dharma King Commentary says: "Master Cien states 'In Sanskrit called maṇi, in Chinese called wish-fulfilling,' taking maṇi as the Sanskrit for wish-fulfilling. If following this meaning, the sūtra texts translated by the Tang Tripiṭaka would not list maṇi and wish-fulfilling, but should raise one randomly. Just like the Mahāprajñāpāramitā, etc. Master Zizhou [says] 'cintāmaṇi, in Chinese called wish-fulfilling treasure jewel,' taking cintā as the Sanskrit for wish-fulfilling. Now examining this meaning, the customs of the five Indian [regions] are not the same; following each country there are different explanations. Cien explained the Mahāprajñāpāramitā; Sizhou interpreted the present sūtra. But the Mahāprajñāpāramitā was translated by Tripiṭaka Xuanzang, transmitting the correct pronunciation of Central India. The Suvarṇaprabhāsa-sūtra was translated by Tripiṭaka Yijing, translating the border pronunciation of South India. If so, in Central Indian custom, maṇi is the Sanskrit for wish-fulfilling; in South Indian practice, cintā is the Sanskrit pronunciation for wish-fulfilling. But when the present sūtra says 'wish-fulfilling maṇi,' we don't know what it depends on. Therefore, sometimes depending on border land customs, sometimes depending on Central Indian practices should be raised. Following this, Master Puyang makes two explanations. One says: 'There are jewels of superior and inferior [grades], divided into two types,' etc. The meaning is: maṇi is not the Sanskrit for wish-fulfilling. Cintā is the Sanskrit pronunciation for wish-fulfilling. Therefore maṇi is not wish-fulfilling. This is a separate inferior jewel. Wish-fulfilling jewels are also not maṇi. They are separate superior jewels. Therefore the sūtra text explains them separately."

My view: This present Comprehensive Explanation judges that there are distinctions in superior and inferior following South Indian practices. "Some sūtras speak, etc." is not two explanations. The Lotus Sūtra text raises superior and inferior; other Suvarṇaprabhāsa-sūtras, etc., also like the present

【Lower section】
Lotus Sūtra, raise both Chinese and Sanskrit to manifest superior and inferior. The word "some" means "some sūtras speak of maṇi wish-fulfilling to manifest superior and inferior" - this is the explanation.

Question: What stage bodhisattva is Bodhisattva Ruciraketu? There are two views. If a pre-ground bodhisattva, examining the sūtra text and investigating the wholesome roots cultivated, it says "at countless koṭi nayuta hundred thousand buddha places in the past, [he] cultivated various wholesome roots," etc. His virtue is already high and his cultivated practices are superior. He should definitely be a deep-stage great being. Moreover, the four buddhas in the four directions are sambhoga-kāya buddhas. The bodhisattvas they teach should definitely be ground-stage bodhisattvas. Therefore Master Zizhou judges [him to be] an eighth-ground bodhisattva. If following this reasoning, when Great Being Ruciraketu describes hearing the golden drum's sound in a dream and has the matter of sleep, he should be called a pre-ground bodhisattva. Looking at the prophecy of eons, "after passing immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of nayutas of eons, [he] can attain buddhahood," etc. The prophecy of future buddhahood appears to be a shallow-stage bodhisattva. How is this?

My view: This present bodhisattva's virtuous practices appear to be those of a deep-stage great being. Therefore Master Zizhou explains [him as] an eighth-ground bodhisattva. This explanation accords with the sūtra text and fits with reason. The sūtra text is like one-sided doubt and difficulty. As for reason, the commentary master explains this bodhisattva's name and title: "Superior wisdom distinctly excels, uniquely transcending the multitude of manifestations," etc. The meaning is: "Being far removed from biased attachments is called 'wondrous'; virtue surpassing the multitude and manifesting loftily is called 'banner.'" This name appears to be that of a deep-stage great being. However, regarding sleep, dreams are metaphors, not actual events. They use saṃsāra as a metaphor for dreams. Next, regarding the prophecy of future buddhahood, the three grounds of eighth, ninth, and tenth are called the third asaṃkhyeya. Since this bodhisattva is at the eighth ground, after passing one great asaṃkhyeya he attains buddhahood

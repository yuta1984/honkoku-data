Not saying "preparatory non-discriminating wisdom" and "subsequently-attained non-discriminating wisdom," but separately describing non-discriminating wisdom as not being fundamental wisdom - where is the evidence for this? Here in the present text, beyond the two wisdoms, it says "non-discriminating wisdom." Without dispute, following the order of shallow to deep, preparatory, subsequently-attained, and fundamental should be listed. Moreover, since the commentary already provides many explanations, even if making the present explanation, why is there no explanation following the order of shallow to deep? Therefore, the present explanation becomes increasingly questionable.

Question: In the commentary of this fascicle, regarding the comparison between new and old [translations], in clarifying the presence/absence and division/combination of chapters, is the doctrinal content of the Chapter of Praise by the Great Eloquence Goddess present in the old translated sūtra, or how is it? From both perspectives:
If present, examining the texts of the four-fascicle and eight-fascicle sūtras and searching for the text of the Chapter of Praise, there is completely no text praising the Eloquence Goddess. Based on this, in the commentary of the present fascicle it states "the old sūtra has no praise of the heavenly eloquence," etc.
If according to this it is absent, in the present commentary, regarding what was first translated and added in the newly translated sūtra, only the Jinsho Dhāraṇī Chapter and the Wish-fulfilling Jewel Chapter are mentioned. If the old translation had no text praising the Eloquence Goddess, why not mention it? Moreover, the Chapter of Praise by Bodhisattvas of the Ten Directions, Chapter of Praise by Bodhisattva Wonderful Banner, Chapter of Praise by the Bodhi Tree Spirit, and Chapter of the Great Eloquence Goddess - these four chapters combined are explained as being called the "Chapter of Praising the Buddha" in the old translated sūtra. These translations clearly show their presence in the old translation.

In my opinion, both meanings of presence and absence are possible. If discussing based on the absence of words of praise, it should be said to be absent. If, though lacking words of praise, it explains matters of eloquence, it should be said to be present.

Therefore, since the Jinsho Dhāraṇī and Wish-fulfilling Jewel chapters are completely absent from the old translation, it is said thus. The four chapters of praise equally clarify matters of the Eloquence Goddess, so they are combined and spoken of thus. There is no fault.

Inquiring further: That the four chapters of praise equally clarify matters of eloquence and are therefore collectively called the Chapter of Praising the Buddha is unclear. The three chapters including the Chapter of Praise by Bodhisattvas of the Ten Directions do not separately clarify matters of the Great Eloquence Goddess. How can it be said they equally clarify matters of eloquence?

Reconciling this: "Equally clarifying matters of eloquence" means that the bodhisattvas of the ten directions praising the Buddha depends on possessing the four eloquences. Since the other three chapters have this meaning, they clarify the meaning of eloquence. It is not clarifying matters of the Great Eloquence Goddess.

Question: The sūtra text clarifies Bodhisattva Wonderful Banner's praise of the Buddha: "Also like golden mountain light universally illuminating, completely able to pervade hundreds of thousands of lands," etc. Then, how does the commentary master explain this? Proceeding to say: It explains this as praising both body and light together. Regarding this: According to the commentary master's explanation, examining the sūtra text from beginning to end, stating "also like golden mountain light universally illuminating" appears to praise only light. Explaining "completely able to pervade hundreds of thousands of lands," could the measure of the transformation body have the meaning of pervasion? Here we know this is praising only light. Moreover, looking at the text immediately above, it states "like the sun first rising and reflecting in empty space," etc. This is where light is praised. The word "also" in "also like golden mountain" means "also" in relation to the sun-rising metaphor. In the sequential meaning of the text, is it not praising only light? How is this?

In my opinion, the commentary master's interpretation most accords with the sequence of the sūtra text. The one verse "The Sage's hundred auspicious marks are perfect," etc., praises only the body. The one verse "Brilliant colors, boundless light blazing," etc., praises only light. This present verse praises body and light together. Stating "also like golden mountain" - how could this not be the body? "Light universally illuminates, completely able to pervade hundreds of thousands of lands" praises light. Light should most appropriately have the meaning of pervasion. Next, placing the word "also" means "also" in addition to the above two verses praising body and light. The sequence of the sūtra text is thus. It should be read as "also like golden mountain."

Question: In the sūtra text clarifying the meaning of praising Buddha's virtues, should Bodhisattva Wonderful Banner praise the dharma body? Proceeding to say: The commentary states it does not praise the dharma body. Regarding this: The dharma body is the support of great meritorious dharmas and the essential nature that sages should seek. How could Bodhisattva Wonderful Banner's words of praise not extend to the perfect essential nature? Those bodhisattvas of the ten directions visited Vulture Peak and praised the true suchness dharma body. The Bodhi tree spirit praised the fruit virtues, not limited to the two bodies of response and transformation. Therefore, Master Heung of Silla states there is text praising the dharma body. How is this?

In my opinion, examining the eight and a half verses of the present chapter, they altogether praise the merits of response and transformation form characteristics, completely not praising the true principle of dharma. Therefore the commentary master, following the sūtra text, explained thus. Explaining the reason: "Briefly not praising the dharma body because it is deeply hidden," etc. Response and transformation are manifest so they are praised; the true principle is deeply hidden so it is not praised. Wonderful Banner's praise is not that it does not extend to dharma nature - it is the essential nature that sages do not fail to seek, being the support of merit. Moreover, praising and paying homage to it should furthermore not be obstructed.

Question: In the present sūtra commentary, quoting the Vimalakīrti Sūtra: "there are then pure Buddha lands," etc. Then, when post-first-bhūmi bodhisattvas are born in other-enjoyment lands, is that bodhisattva's eighth consciousness born from being stimulated by the karmic seeds and name-and-form seeds of impure lands, or does it arise from separate seeds? From both perspectives:
If arising from impure land seeds, pure and impure lands are vastly different. How could the able-to-produce and able-to-generate be one? Here examining the quoted sūtra text: "According to the purity of mind, there are then pure Buddha lands," etc. This explains that because the eighth consciousness holds the karmic causes of pure lands, when the mind is pure there are then pure Buddha lands. The karmic seeds and name-and-form seeds of impure lands are held by defiled mind and are furthermore not within the scope of the pure gate. If arising in pure lands through impure land karmic causes, how would the distinction of defiled and pure by mind not be confused? Moreover, according to Dharmapāla Bodhisattva's understanding, permitting the existence of naturally inherent seeds of all dharmas, when being born in other-enjoyment pure lands, how could there be no separate seeds? Additionally, during the first incalculable eon, long cultivating the karmic causes of pure Buddha lands, how could there be no function of conditioned birth? Within this, examining the Vijñānavāda treatise text, it criticizes the doctrine that "all sentient beings through shared karma transform the material realm": "Various ordinary beings should actually transform into other regions, this realm, and various pure sublime lands," etc. If through impure karma transforming into pure lands, why suddenly raise this criticism?
If following this interpretation, the reward Buddha's pure land is dwelling place of pure sages alone. In ordinary positions, creating such karma is difficult. Sages do not create new karma. How could this be post-seeing-path karma? Like the karmic causes of Pure Abode heavens, ordinary and sage positions do not create them. If not impure land karmic causes, how be born in that land?

In my opinion, it should depend on impure land karmic causes. The principle is like the doubt and criticism from one side. However, regarding the doubt and criticism

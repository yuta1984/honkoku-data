Why call it the first ground? It should first point to the initial arousing of intention before the grounds. Moreover, looking at the original sūtra text, taking the metaphor of the first moon, it appears to refer to ordinary beings bound by all [afflictions]. In addition, in the Maitreya's Questions Sūtra-Treatise it says "before the grounds." Does the present commentary also question this? If so, the Great Master explained it as the first ground (Xuánzàn volume 9). How should this be understood?

Question: Regarding the four types of arousing intention in Mañjuśrī's Questions Sūtra, is the "one-life-to-supplementation arousing intention" only the tenth ground, or should it extend to the second ground and above? There are problems on both sides. If limited to the tenth ground, looking at that sūtra's commentary treatise text, the third arousing intention says "already entered the first ground," and the fourth arousing intention [mentions] "Prince Good Dwelling." Since the third arousing intention is the first ground, shouldn't the fourth, Prince Good Dwelling, definitely extend to the second ground and above? According to this, in Maitreya's Questions Sūtra-Treatise, that sūtra's fourth arousing intention is at the second ground and above. If this is so, the present commentary says "tenth ground." How should this be understood?

In my view, the Buddha Mother Commentary states: In Mañjuśrī's Questions Sūtra-Treatise there are two meanings. Clarifying initial arousing intention, the first meaning says: Initial arousing intention is before the grounds. Therefore the treatise says: "Furthermore, the divine son's initial arousing intention being able to surpass the śrāvaka ground is because of the initial pre-ground bodhisattva's sharp faculties observing and examining all bodhi-factors." Master Cízhōu's explanation depends on this meaning. The second meaning says: It is at the first ground. Therefore the treatise says: "Furthermore, arousing intention as cause includes... because of observing and examining the first ground's sphere." The Xuánzàn Commentary explains this latter meaning. Master and disciple each describe different meanings. In the "furthermore" passages, they should not contradict each other.

Therefore, examining the Buddha Mother Commentary's intention, since there are already two meanings in the treatise regarding initial arousing intention, there should also be two meanings regarding one-life-to-supplementation arousing intention.

Because the sūtra has many "furthermore" passages, the treatise has different meanings.

The sūtra's metaphor of one-life-to-supplementation arousing intention to the fourteenth day moon is the tenth ground meaning. The other "furthermore" passages express the meaning of second ground and above. Therefore, when the treatise explains the sūtra text, the metaphor of the fourteenth day moon is the tenth ground meaning; the third arousing intention's first ground and the fourth's Prince Good Dwelling represent the second ground and above meaning. Maitreya's Questions Sūtra-Treatise describes the intention of one "furthermore" passage. They should not contradict each other.

Question: Why is the initial chapter of this volume named "Lotus Metaphor Praise Chapter"? Proceeding to say: The commentary states "Because the past Golden Dragon King constantly used lotus flowers to praise all buddhas." Regarding this: examining the sūtra text from beginning to end and observing the Golden Dragon King's praises, for the metaphor of self-radiance and white curl-mark, he cites golden beryl; for the simile of facial features and white teeth, he compares them to full moon and white shell-snow. Beyond these, how many other praise metaphors and comparisons are there in his explanations? If so, why does the lotus metaphor alone manifest the chapter's designation? How should this be understood?

In my view: Examining the sūtra text, "In the past there was a king named Golden Dragon King. He constantly used lotus flowers as metaphors to praise and extol the buddhas of the ten directions and three times." Generally speaking, although praise metaphors and comparisons are not uniform, specifically using lotus flowers for praise and extolment, according to common practice, establishes the chapter's designation. Within this, eyes are compared to blue lotus flowers, and the tongue characteristic is likened to red lotus flowers. Citing other metaphors, lotus metaphors are numerous. Establishing the chapter's designation based on the majority is most reasonable.

Question: Can multiple buddha bodies of sambhogakāya appear simultaneously in one land? There are problems on both sides. If multiple buddhas appear simultaneously, the benefit of one buddha is sufficient. What would be the purpose of multiple buddhas appearing simultaneously? Regarding nirmāṇakāya, this principle does not exist. Why would it be so for sambhogakāya? Here in the Vijñānavāda Treatise: "That is, in one land there is one buddha body, manifesting spiritual powers, teaching dharma to benefit

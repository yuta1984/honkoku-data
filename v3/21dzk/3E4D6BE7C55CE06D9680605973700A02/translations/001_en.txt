A Brief Record of Ten Sects

All phenomena (dharmas) are entirely the one principle of true reality (tathatā), and there is no distinction between Buddhas and sentient beings, between animate and inanimate beings. For example, when water becomes ice, there are differences between east, west, south, and north, but when we look at the essential nature of water, it merges in one taste without any divisions or distinctions. The Nirvana Sutra states "All sentient beings possess Buddha-nature," and the Chū'in Sutra explains "Grass, trees, and lands all attain Buddhahood"—this too expresses this principle. When we say "good and evil are non-dual, wrong and right are one suchness," or "afflictions are bodhi, samsara is nirvana," all of this expresses this same principle.

However, sentient beings are deluded by false thoughts and inverted views, deeply attached to distinctions of right and wrong, good and evil, and because they cannot realize the principle of original oneness, even though they possess the same Buddha-nature, they delude themselves, create the suffering realms of the five or six paths, and wander in the crossroads of birth-death transmigration. "Buddha" refers to nothing special—it means a person who has seen the fundamental principle of all phenomena as it truly is. The various Buddhas, wishing to save and help sentient beings from their inverted delusions, appear in the world generation after generation, teaching the Five Periods and Eight Teachings, sometimes expounding Hinayana, sometimes Mahayana, sometimes provisional teachings, sometimes ultimate teachings, thereby helping beings of various capacities.

Among these, about 2,600 years ago from our present time, a Buddha called Shakyamuni Tathagata appeared in the world and for fifty years taught various dharmas, helping sentient beings whose conditions had ripened. Even during this Buddha's lifetime, the establishment of sectarian doctrines had already begun, as can be seen in the Laṅkāvatāra Sutra.

After this Shakyamuni Buddha's parinirvana, in India, first within Hinayana Buddhism, two fundamental schools were divided, later gradually splitting into five schools, eighteen schools, twenty schools, and so forth. In Mahayana as well, beginning with Aśvaghoṣa Bodhisattva's doctrinal lineage, Nāgārjuna's dharma lineage, Dharmapāla's Yogācāra school, and Bhāvaviveka's Madhyamaka school, the sectarian establishments of various great masters were immeasurable and boundless. These were all the various schools of India, which cannot be described in detail here.

The transmission of Buddhism to China occurred during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Later Han dynasty, in the tenth year of the Yongping era (67 CE), year of the metal rabbit, when two monks, Kāśyapa Mātaṅga and Dharmarakṣa, first brought Buddhist scriptures from India. This corresponded to 1,016 years after the Buddha's parinirvana. Although Daoist priests engaged in doctrinal debates at that time, ultimately Buddhism's superiority became evident and it spread throughout the land. Gradually transmitted through the generations, there came to be thirteen schools: first the Abhidharmakośa school, second the Satyasiddhi school, third the Vinaya school, fourth...

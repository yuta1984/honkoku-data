Although there are doctrinal judgments of different streams, they are shallow interpretations that do not reach the target.

Now, the Four Teachings are: First, the Tripiṭaka Teaching. This collectively refers to the Hīnayāna teachings such as the Āgama. Second, the Shared Teaching. This is the dharma-gate of understanding emptiness that the three vehicles study in common. Third, the Distinct Teaching. This clarifies the sequential three truths. It is exclusively the dharma for bodhisattvas. These Shared and Distinct Teachings are provisional Mahāyāna. They are found within the Vaipulya and Prajñā [periods]. Also, there is the Distinct Teaching within the Avataṃsaka Sutra. Fourth, the Perfect Teaching. This clarifies the wonderful meaning of perfect interfusion and inconceivability inherently complete in one's own mind. It is true Mahāyāna. Within this, the Perfect [teaching] before [the Lotus] is the Perfect of non-opening and revealing, while the Perfect of the Lotus is the Perfect of opening and revealing. There are also the Four Teachings of Conversion Forms: sudden teaching, gradual teaching, indeterminate teaching, and secret teaching. These distinguish four types of characteristics regarding the ritual forms for expounding the previous Four Teachings of Conversion Methods. The dharma-essence does not change.

Next, the Five Periods are: First, the Avataṃsaka Period. This expounds the two teachings of Distinct and Perfect. It is the sutra expounded for three times seven days. However, there is what is called the later portion of Avataṃsaka, which was expounded throughout the lifetime. Second, the Āgama Period. During twelve years, the Hīnayāna Tripiṭaka Teaching was expounded. Third, the Vaipulya Period. During sixteen years, all four teachings were expounded completely. Fourth, the Prajñā Period. This was expounded for fourteen years. The three teachings of Shared, Distinct, and Perfect were presented. Fifth, the Lotus-Nirvana Period. The Lotus is purely Perfect teaching that opens the provisional, expounding the secret wonder of predicting [enlightenment for] the small [vehicle] and [revealing] eternal accomplishment [of Buddhahood]. It is the supreme true Mahāyāna. The Nirvana, though it completely expounds the four teachings, immediately explains opening and integration as "immediately establishing and immediately discarding," so it is simultaneous with the Lotus. The above is called the Five Periods.

Also, the Five Flavors appear in the text of the Nirvana Sutra. The five periods of the lifetime are matched in sequence to milk flavor, cheese flavor, raw butter flavor, cooked butter flavor, and ghee flavor. Also, the fundamental principle of one-mind true characteristic includes the three virtue-functions of immediate emptiness, provisional existence, and middle. This is called the Three Truths. The wisdom that contemplates these Three Truths is called the Three Contemplations.

The Ten Realms are: the realm of aggregates and sense-fields, the realm of afflictions, the realm of illness, the realm of karmic characteristics, the realm of demonic affairs, the realm of meditative concentration, the realm of various views, the realm of pride, the realm of the two vehicles, and the realm of bodhisattvas. These are the realms to be contemplated. The first, aggregates and sense-fields, is the present realm. The remaining nine are contemplated when they arise.

The Ten Vehicle Contemplation Methods are: first, contemplating the inconceivable realm; second, arousing compassionate mind; third, skillfully settling stopping and contemplation; fourth, breaking through dharma pervasion; fifth, recognizing penetration and obstruction; sixth, harmonizing the factors of enlightenment; seventh, applying counteractive assistance and opening; eighth, knowing sequential stages; ninth, being able to patiently endure; tenth, having no attachment to dharmas. Those of superior faculties accomplish it with the first contemplation alone. Those of middle and lower faculties must complete two, or seven, or all ten. Such meanings are dharma-gates of profound subtlety, not for those of shallow wisdom to understand. There are countless other dharma-gates. The essential point is to understand the three thousand [realms] in one thought-moment of contemplating the inconceivable realm.

All dharmas' true characteristic is the oneness of myriad dharmas, where all dharmas of form and mind completely interfuse. Originally there are no defiled characteristics of separation and obstruction. Sentient beings, through delusive thoughts and inversions, grasp and perceive the differential characteristics of self and other, ordinary beings and Buddhas, sentient and insentient, good and evil, suffering and pleasure. Now, hearing the Tathāgata's wonderful dharma of perfect interfusion, they understand that precisely the very substance of one thought-moment of greed, anger, and delusion is the wonderful principle of true suchness and true characteristic, complete with all dharmas of the ten realms and three thousand.

"Three thousand" means: when the ten realms mutually include each other, there are one hundred realms. When the one hundred realms each possess the ten suchnesses, there are one thousand suchnesses. When these thousand suchnesses each possess the three types of worlds, there are three thousand worlds. The three types of worlds are: the world of lands, the world of sentient beings, and the world of the five aggregates. Such three thousand myriad dharmas are originally of one nature of true suchness, where even in one form or one fragrance all other myriad dharmas are complete, and in one speck of dust or one mind all dharmas are also complete—like Indra's jeweled net. Now, precisely pointing to the practitioner's one thought-moment as the contemplated essence, it is called "three thousand in one thought-moment." This is also called "immediate one-mind three contemplations," because the three truths of emptiness, provisional existence, and middle are contemplated in one mind.

Emptiness means that within the essential substance of true characteristic, the differential characteristics of the three thousand are extinguished and void, being empty, tranquil, and without characteristics. Provisional existence means that although extinguished, the provisional characteristics of myriad dharmas clearly exist. Middle means that the essential nature of true characteristic cannot be called either having characteristics or being without characteristics—the place that does not lean toward existence or non-existence. These three truths mutually include and perfectly interfuse: emptiness is immediately provisional and middle, middle is immediately emptiness and provisional, provisional is immediately emptiness and middle. Therefore, the three truths are one essence, the inconceivable ultimate principle of neither three nor one. Because the three truths are contemplated immediately in one mind in this way, it is called "one-mind three contemplations." When this contemplation is accomplished and one awakens to and manifests the essential principle of myriad dharmas, this is called becoming Buddha.

Even speaking of the five periods and eight teachings of the lifetime does not go beyond this dharma-gate of three thousand in one thought-moment. Therefore, the Shizhiqian states: "The entire period, whether horizontal or vertical, does not go beyond the three thousand worlds in one thought-moment being immediately empty, provisional, and middle." The excellent doctrine by which the Tiantai school surpasses all other schools lies exclusively in the three thousand inherently complete in principle. Its source emerges from the text of the Lotus Sutra's brief opening of the three thousand suchnesses, and it is the ultimate discourse unknown to other schools. All schools after Tiantai Great Master have relied upon and trusted in this wonderful doctrine of inherent completion in principle, as recorded in detail in the Collection of Dependencies.

Now, regarding the sequence of teacher-disciple succession in this school, the Xiuju states: "Clearly know that the Lotus school as explained by Tiantai is the school established by Śākyamuni World-Honored One. This is the foremost teaching of all Tathāgatas. Also, among all sutras, it stands supreme. How could the Great Silent Sage have personal preferences? This is the principle of the dharma, worthy of praise. That Master Vasubandhu explained it as unsurpassed has good reason. That the Tiantai Lotus school excels over all schools is because it is based on the sutra it depends upon. This is not self-praise while denigrating others. May wise gentlemen investigate the sutras and determine the school."

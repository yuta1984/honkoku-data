Therefore. 《Interlinear note: Above》 This is because within the Lotus Sutra there are the three teachings of dharma teachers and the ten metaphors of Medicine King, etc. That the Lotus is revered and made primary is the imperial decree of Śākyamuni. Hence it is also called the Buddha-established school. The Lotus Transmission Record states: "Paramārtha Tripiṭaka said: In the West it is transmitted that the great teaching of the Lotus flowed and spread throughout the five parts of India, creating upadeśas to explain its textual meaning—over fifty schools. After the Buddha's nirvana, at the end of five hundred years, Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva composed the Lotus Treatise. At the beginning of six hundred years, Sthiramati Bodhisattva composed a commentary treatise. Both have not yet come to this land (China), and their essential meaning cannot be fathomed. In the nine hundredth year, in North India's Puruṣapura country, the state preceptor, great brahmin Kauśika's son Vasubandhu—called Tiānqīn [in Chinese]—also composed a Lotus Treatise. Using the sixty-four section dharma-gate, he explained its great meaning." Therefore, in India, the prosperity of the Lotus school was vast and boundless. However, with the country distant and time separated, the historical traces are difficult to know and the transmission is hard to continue.

Properly speaking, in the Northern Qi period of China, there was a person called Dhyāna Master Huiwen. From the beginning he studied the Perfect Vehicle, achieved natural solitary enlightenment, and when he perused the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra composed by Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva, the thirteenth patriarch from Śākyamuni, upon reaching the thirteenth fascicle there was a passage on one-mind three wisdoms. Master Huiwen saw this and cultivated mind-contemplation, suddenly accomplished contemplative practice, realized one-mind three wisdoms, and entered the stage of first abiding and tolerance of non-arising. Also, seeing the passage in the Mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā's chapter on the Four Noble Truths: "What arises through causes and conditions, I teach is precisely emptiness, also called provisional designation, also the meaning of the Middle Way,"

[Page 14, Lower Section]
he greatly awakened to the meaning of all dharmas arising through conditions being immediately empty, provisional, and middle. His virtue and conduct were unparalleled along the rivers Huai and He, and his transformative way had no equal in the world. He personally transmitted the mind-contemplation orally to Dhyāna Master Nanyue Huisi. Great Master Nanyue cultivated this and attained purification of the six faculties, then transmitted it to Great Master Zhizhe. Tiantai Zhizhe received this and awakened to the Buddha-vehicle of the Lotus, established the five periods and eight teachings, and expounded the ten chapters and ten vehicles. His discourse on the three thousand [realms] being immediately complete in both phenomena and principle surpassed a hundred schools and excelled through the millennia, finally becoming the foundation of the world's clear teaching. Thereafter, Great Master Zhangan, Great Master Zhiwei, Great Master Huiwei, Great Master Xuanlang, Great Master Miaole, Venerable Daosui and others transmitted it in succession, and the authentic transmission of China continues unbroken to the present world. Therefore, the Tiantai school properly takes Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva as its founding patriarch and Dhyāna Master Huiwen as its second patriarch. This is recorded in detail in the Buddhist Patriarchs' Chronicle. There is also the succession of direct transmission to Nanyue and direct transmission to Tiantai. The transmission text is cited in the Student's Formulary.

Now, speaking of the meaning of transmission to Japan: during the reign of Emperor Kanmu, the fiftieth human sovereign, Great Master Dengyō made his entry to Tang China. He met Venerable Daosui of Guoqing Temple on Mount Tiantai, received transmission of Tiantai's self-realized one-mind three contemplations, and received the perfect sudden precepts and vinaya. Moreover, he met Venerable Shunxiao and learned and transmitted the supreme vehicle of Shingon, and followed Master Xiuran to receive transmission of Bodhidharma's Zen methods.

[Page 15, Upper Section]
Also, within the Mahā-śamatha-vipaśyanā there are dharma-gates of Buddha-recitation. Therefore, the mountain gate of our country contains Tiantai, esoteric, Zen, vinaya, and Buddha-recitation. Also, Great Master Jikaku and Great Master Chishō made entries to Tang China. Together they mastered the profound essentials of exoteric, esoteric, and Zen [teachings]. From then until now, this school has been prosperous through successive generations. Not only does the Tiantai teaching of one-mind three contemplations excel, but the spiritual efficacy of Shingon esoteric methods also surpasses other schools. Thus when Eryō performed skull-breaking [divination], the younger prince ascended the throne. When Son'i performed ritual empowerment, Kan Shōjō's spirit dissipated. The manifest responses of the mountain gate's Buddhism are recorded in detail in various biographies. Therefore, in recent years when Lord Toyotomi Taikō Hideyoshi invited the eight schools to Myōhōin Monzeki and performed the thousand-monk offering, when he gathered wise people of various ways and evaluated the superiority and inferiority of the various schools, without dispute he established the Tiantai school as the first and highest seat.

VIII. Shingon School

There is the doctrine of one Buddha, two bodies—the true and response bodies. The response body of the present Buddha is named Śākyamuni, and the true body is named Vairocana. Vairocana is called Dainichi [Great Sun]. The true body is called the Dharma-body. The dharma-gates expounded in the form of Śākyamuni's response body are called exoteric teaching. These are the five periods and eight teachings of the lifetime. The dharma-gates expounded in the form of Dainichi's Dharma-body

[Page 15, Lower Section]
are called esoteric teaching. These are the mantras and dhāraṇīs. This Shingon esoteric teaching is the supreme dharma-gate that Dainichi Tathāgata expounded in the eternal Dharma-realm palace of the three times for bodhisattvas who have severed ignorance on the ground [levels]. What is formed with the hands is called mudrā. What is chanted with the mouth is called vidyā-mantra. Vidyā-mantra is precisely mantra. In the mind, one contemplates the seed-syllable, honored form, and samaya of the principal deity. This is called the practice of the three mysteries. This is not something that ordinary beings of lower stages can reach with their thoughts and verbal discussions. The ritual practices of the various deities are vast and boundless, difficult to record in full. Their essential point lies in the contemplation of the A-syllable's original non-arising. Know that what is called the ultimate meaning of the Shingon teaching is the original emptiness of profound non-characteristics. The oral instructions of various lineages are difficult to unify. Without entering that gate and accumulating years of practice and study, it is difficult to understand.

The Womb Realm and Diamond Realm are called the Two Divisions. These are the two of principle and wisdom. The Buddha Division, Lotus Division, and Vajra Division are called the Three Divisions. Adding the Karma Division makes Five Divisions. The Womb Realm has four layers, the Diamond Realm has nine assemblies. Their profound subtlety cannot be expressed. The Meaning Commentary states: "Because it is the language of true suchness, it is called true word (mantra)." Therefore, according to the Six Perfections Sutra, even those with grave sins who cannot gain benefit from exoteric teaching can eliminate sins and attain the Way through the teaching power of the true word's ghee. Truly this is the great dharma of attaining Buddhahood in this very body. This

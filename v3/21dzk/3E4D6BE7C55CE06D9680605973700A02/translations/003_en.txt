various dharmas of defilement and purity. For example, when hemp is made into rope, and one mistakes the rope for a snake, the appearing of the snake's vigor is like parikalpita (imagined nature). This has only subjective cognition but no underlying principle. It is like there being no substance or function of a snake on the rope. The rope's appearance being merely provisional is like the provisional nature of paratantra (dependent nature). Only the hemp being the real substance is like the principle of pariniṣpanna (perfected nature). Parikalpita has subjective cognition but no principle. The essence of vijñānavāda (consciousness-only) contemplation is to eliminate the false conceptualization of parikalpita and contemplate the characteristics of paratantra and pariniṣpanna. Fundamental wisdom (mūlajñāna) realizes the principle of pariniṣpanna, while subsequently attained wisdom (pṛṣṭhalabdhajñāna) illuminates the characteristics of paratantra. The correct wisdom of non-discrimination is self-realization, while subsequently attained wisdom is compassionate transformation of others. Therefore, the general principle of contemplative practice is to eliminate the subjective and objective attachments of parikalpita and maintain the realm of paratantra and pariniṣpanna that accords with principle and measure. This is precisely the profound doctrine maintained by the Faxiang school.

This school has been transmitted by Maitreya Bodhisattva since countless eons ago. After Śākyamuni's parinirvāṇa, Vasubandhu and Asaṅga Bodhisattvas of India would ascend to Tuṣita Heaven at night to hear Maitreya's teachings, then descend to the lower world during the day to teach the assembly. This is the hundred-fascicle Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra. Vasubandhu also composed the Vijñaptimātra verses. Venerable Dharmapāla commented on these, and Ācārya Śīlabhadra propagated them. During the Zhenguan era of Emperor Taizong, the second ruler of the Great Tang, Tripiṭaka Master Xuanzang went to Central India, met Ācārya Śīlabhadra and greatly received transmission of this school, then returned to China and propagated it throughout the realm. Among his thousands of disciples, the foremost was Master Ji of Cien Temple. Master Ji's lineage descendants are immeasurable and boundless.

The transmission to Japan occurred during the reign of the thirty-seventh sovereign, Emperor Kōtoku, in the fourth year of Hakuchi, year of the water ox (653 CE), when the priest Dōshō of Gangō-ji received imperial orders to enter Tang China, arrived at Chang'an, had audience with Tripiṭaka Master Xuanzang, and studied this Faxiang school before returning. Later, the two masters Jitsū and Chittatsu, as well as the three Silla masters Chihō, Chiraku, and Chiyū, each entered Tang China to transmit the Faxiang school and came to our court to propagate it. Vinaya Master Gien studied and transmitted these teachings. Gien had seven foremost disciples: Genbō, Gyōki, Senkyō, Ryōbin, Gyōtatsu, Ryūson, and Ryōben. Among these, Genbō again entered Tang China and transmitted the Faxiang school. Therefore, although Kōfuku-ji is considered the foundation temple of the Faxiang school, all temples of the southern capital study this school. Although they claim to be reasonable, perfect, and true, when viewed from the perspective of supreme Mahāyāna, the Faxiang school represents the level of the Distinct Teaching of Tiantai. Although it establishes the Three Period Teaching to classify the Buddha's entire teaching career, this is fundamentally based on the explanations of the Saṃdhinirmocana and Yogācāra texts, representing doctrines from before the Vaipulya period, so the Three Period Teaching actually corresponds to the three teachings of Tripiṭaka, Shared, and Distinct. Moreover, the doctrine of Five Distinct Natures is precisely a teaching method of the Distinct Teaching, not the true doctrine of the Perfect Teaching.

The perfect doctrine of the Tiantai school is that all sentient beings without exception will attain Buddhahood. This principle is detailed in works such as the Shūku, Shugoshō, and Ichijō Yōketsu. Generally speaking, the five natures, five dharmas, three natures, etc. expounded in the Laṅkāvatāra are all doctrines of sequential differentiation, not doctrines of perfect subtlety. This doctrine is clarified in fascicles nine and ten of Shōshin's private commentary on the Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra.

**3. Huayan School (Avatamsaka School)**
The Avataṃsaka Sutra represents the Buddha's initial teaching upon his enlightenment. The old translation has sixty fascicles, the new translation has eighty fascicles. Besides these, there are many versions in the Dragon Palace. In India, Samantabhadra, Mañjuśrī, Aśvaghoṣa, Nāgārjuna, Sthiramati and others exclusively propagated this sutra, and Vasubandhu composed the Daśabhūmika-śāstra to explain it. This is the origin of the Huayan school. In China, during the fourteenth year of Yixi of Emperor An, the tenth ruler of Eastern Jin, in the year wuwu (418 CE), Tripiṭaka Master Buddhabhadra first translated the Avataṃsaka Sutra and propagated it. Later, during the Tang period, Śikṣānanda again translated the Avataṃsaka Sutra. Dushun, Zhiyan, Fazang, Qingliang, Guifeng and others vigorously transmitted it.

This school establishes Five Teachings to encompass the Buddha's entire career and uses the Six Characteristics and Ten Mysteries to explain the meaning of all dharmas. Its fundamental doctrine is the unobstructed interpenetration of all phenomena. The Five Teachings were established by Master Fazang. First is the Hīnayāna Teaching, referring to sutras such as the Āgama. Second is the Mahāyāna Initial Teaching, referring to sutras such as the Saṃdhinirmocana. This already clarifies the doctrine of Five Distinct Natures and explains that those of fixed nature and no-nature cannot attain Buddhahood. It does not yet exhaust the principles of Mahāyāna, hence called Initial Teaching, also called Partial Teaching. Third is the Final Teaching, also called Real Teaching, referring to various authentic Mahāyāna sutras. It clarifies that those of the two fixed vehicles and icchantikas of no-nature all without exception attain Buddhahood. This is precisely the supreme teaching of Mahāyāna, hence called Final Teaching, referring to sutras such as the Nirvana. Fourth is the Sudden Teaching, which has no separate sutra category but takes the doctrine of "mind itself is Buddha" and "no sequential stages" from various Mahāyāna teachings to constitute the Sudden Teaching—namely, Chan methods. Fifth is the Perfect Teaching, which is precisely the Avataṃsaka Sutra. It clarifies the doctrines of "one stage is all stages, all stages are one stage," the Samantabhadra dharmadhātu, the infinitely layered Indra's net, and the complete presence of primary and accompanying [bodhisattvas].

The Six Characteristics are: general characteristic, particular characteristic, same characteristic, different characteristic, formation characteristic, and destruction characteristic. The Treatise on the Five Teachings states: "General characteristic means one contains multiple virtues. Particular characteristic means multiple virtues are not one. The particular depends on the general and fulfills that general. Same characteristic means multiple meanings do not conflict and together form one general. Different characteristic means multiple meanings in mutual comparison are each different. Formation characteristic means through these various meanings, dependent origination is accomplished. Destruction characteristic means the various meanings each abide in their own dharma without moving."

The Ten Mysteries, according to the Zangsheng Dharma Numbers: First, the gate of simultaneous complete mutual correspondence—like one drop of seawater containing the flavors of a hundred rivers. Second, the gate of unobstructed freedom between vast and narrow—like a foot-wide mirror seeing images from a thousand li. Third, the gate of mutual containment of one and many without sameness—like a thousand lamps in one room with light interpenetrating light. Fourth, the gate of mutual identity and freedom of all dharmas—like gold and color not being separate from each other. Fifth, the secret hidden...

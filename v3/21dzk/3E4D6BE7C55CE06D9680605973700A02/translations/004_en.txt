manifestation gate. Like a crescent moon clearing the sky with light and darkness appearing together. Sixth is the gate of subtle mutual containment and establishment—like a lapis lazuli vase containing many mustard seeds. Seventh is the Indra's net realm gate—two mirrors mutually reflecting, transmitting radiance and copying each other. Eighth is the gate of relying on phenomena to reveal dharma and generate understanding—standing images and firm arms touching the eye all become the Way. Ninth is the gate of different accomplishments across the ten time periods—like soaring through a hundred years in one evening's dream. Tenth is the gate of primary and accompanying perfect illumination with complete virtues—like the North Star's position with all stars surrounding it.

This doctrine of Six Characteristics and Ten Mysteries is extraordinarily difficult. All represent the true meaning based on the perfect interfusion of all dharmas. By clarifying such doctrines, one cultivates the unobstructed interpenetration of all phenomena.

The transmission of the Huayan school to Japan occurred during the reign of Emperor Shōmu, in the eighth year of Tempyō, year of the fire mouse (736 CE), when Vinaya Master Daoxuan of Great Tang brought the commentaries and notes of the Huayan school to court. Master Xuan was a disciple of Priest Puji of Huayan Temple in the Tang court. Although he transmitted the religious teachings, he had not yet lectured or propagated them. At that time, Vinaya Master Rōben wished to propagate the Huayan school and invited the great virtuous Simsang, a Silla student of Daian-ji, to first lecture and proclaim the Avatamsaka Sutra at the Golden Bell Practice Hall of Tōdai-ji on the eighth day of the tenth month of the twelfth year of Tempyō, year of the metal dragon (740 CE). The miraculous responses were manifold. Emperor Shōmu became the great patron, made Tōdai-ji the head of all temples, and established it as the main temple of the Huayan school. Vinaya Master Rōben was the initial vow-making master of the Huayan school. Great Virtuous Simsang was a renowned sage who met Master Fazang of Great Tang and received transmission of the Huayan school. From then on, the dharma lamp continued unbroken and the sectarian transmission has been continuous. Therefore, the Japanese Huayan school considers Great Virtuous Simsang as its founder. This is the explanation in the Record of Transmission Through Three Countries. The Genkō Shakusho considers Priest Jikun of Kōfuku-ji as the founding patriarch of the Huayan school in our court.

Although this school discusses the unobstructed interpenetration of all phenomena as the doctrine of authentic Mahāyāna, the foundational Avatamsaka Sutra already contains both One Vehicle and Distinct Teaching elements. It lacks passages about the Buddha-making of the two vehicles and eternal true accomplishment. The Daśabhūmika-śāstra states that the causal portion can be explained but the fruition portion cannot be explained. The ancestral explanations of those who propagated it only speak of "nature-origination" without mentioning "nature-inclusion." It has not yet reached the supremely profound One Vehicle Lotus perfect school. Therefore, even the Avatamsaka is merely an inducement toward the Lotus.

**4. Abhidharmakośa School**
In practicing the Hīnayāna Āgama sutras taught by the Buddha, there are the existence gate, emptiness gate, both-existence-and-emptiness gate, and neither-existence-nor-emptiness gate. These are called the Four Gates. The Abhidharmakośa school takes the doctrine of the existence gate as its fundamental principle. One hundred years after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, the lineage of Upagupta divided into five schools. The second, the Sarvāstivāda school, represents the existence gate doctrine. Later, various great arhats composed the Abhidharmāṣṭagrantha-śāstra, Jñānaprasthāna-śāstra, Mahāvibhāṣā-śāstra, and others. All represent existence gate doctrine. Particularly, over nine hundred years after the Tathāgata's parinirvāṇa, Vasubandhu Bodhisattva composed the Abhidharmakośa-śāstra. This exclusively represents existence gate doctrine.

First, heretics calculate that the dharmas of birth and death either arise from Īśvara, or that eighty thousand eons ago was obscure and unknowable—this being the fundamental nature of the world, called "world-nature," with all sentient beings arising from this world-nature. Or they calculate that fine particles aggregate to become various dharmas, or consider parents as the source of birth without knowing what came before parents. All these are called wrong causation. Some heretics calculate that all dharmas exist naturally as such, with no creator. This is called no-causation.

However, what Buddhist existence gate doctrine calls correct dependent origination clarifies that the various dharmas of six-realm birth and death arise through the causation of afflictions and karma. This is precisely the real existence of the two truths of suffering and accumulation. Contemplating these conditioned dharmas as suffering, empty, impermanent, and selfless, and cultivating the practices of the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment constitutes true practice of the path. Thus the path truth that remedies is real existence. Moreover, by eliminating the two truths of suffering and accumulation and attaining the two nirvanas with and without remainder, one meets true principle through cessation. True principle is also real existence. This is the essence of existence gate abhidharma.

Furthermore, by establishing the real dharmas of the five aggregates and thoroughly refuting the various dharmas of self, person, sentient being, and provisional combination, ultimately only real dharmas exist, and entering principle from the place where these real dharmas truly exist is called existence gate doctrine. Maintaining this principle is called the existence gate Abhidharmakośa school. Although it is a Hīnayāna teaching method and not the doctrine of complete principle, its essential point is to empty the dharmas of sentient being combinations, sever the afflictions of views and思惑, and escape the birth and death of the three realms. Although it establishes real dharmas of the five aggregates, because it clarifies that they arise and perish moment by moment, it differs from eternalist heretics.

The transmission of this existence gate school to China occurred in the sixteenth year of Dayuan of Emperor Xiaowu, the ninth ruler of Eastern Jin, year of the metal rabbit (391 CE), when Saṅghadeva of North India first translated the four fascicles of Dharmaśreṣṭhi Abhidharma. This was the beginning. Thereafter, generations lectured and propagated it. Tripiṭaka Master Paramārtha of the Chen dynasty translated the Abhidharmakośa-śāstra, called the old translation. What is properly called the Abhidharmakośa-śāstra is when Tripiṭaka Master Xuanzang of the Tang crossed to India, transmitted this school, and translated the Abhidharmakośa-śāstra in thirty fascicles. This is the new translation. Xuanzang's disciples Puguang, Fashi, Shentai, Yuanhui and other masters each composed commentaries and notes and vigorously propagated these teachings. From this time it was called the Abhidharmakośa school.

Regarding its transmission to our Japan, the year is not clear. One record states that Priest Genbō of the Faxiang school entered Tang China and brought back the Abhidharmakośa school. An official document from the Enryaku era states that the Abhidharmakośa school was attached to the Faxiang school. However, all temples of the southern capital, Onjōji, and Mt. Hiei study the Abhidharmakośa-śāstra. Properly speaking, Tōdai-ji is the main center of the Abhidharmakośa school. Scholars of both the Huayan and Sanlun schools all [study the Abhidharmakośa].

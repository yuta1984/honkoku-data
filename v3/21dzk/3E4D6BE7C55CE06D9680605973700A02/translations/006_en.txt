[they] uphold. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya consists of 250 precepts. They are divided into seven groups: bhikṣu (monks), bhikṣuṇī (nuns), upāsaka (laymen), upāsikā (laywomen), śrāmaṇera (novice monks), śrāmaṇerikā (novice nuns), and śikṣamāṇā (probationary nuns), with precept-dharmas being conferred on each respectively. The four grave prohibitions—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, and false speech—form the foundation. The names and meanings of the 250 precepts cannot be fully written out here. In India, these precepts and vinaya were practiced vigorously. The branches and aspects are manifold.

One thousand and sixteen years after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, in the tenth year of Yongping of the Later Han (67 CE), Buddhism first crossed to China, but the precept-dharmas had not yet been transmitted. After more than 340 years, in the twelfth year of Hongshi of Yao Qin, year of the metal dog (400 CE), the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya was first brought across and translated by Buddhayaśas. However, it was not yet lectured upon. Later, from Vinaya Master Facong of Northern Qi onward, they exclusively lectured on and propagated the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. Twenty lineages composed commentaries on the Four-Part [Vinaya]. It was successively transmitted through Liang, Chen, Sui, and Tang. When it reached Vinaya Master Daoxuan of Nanshan in the Tang court, he composed the Precept Commentary, Karma Commentary, and Compendium of Practice, vigorously making precepts and vinaya his school. Therefore, Nanshan Vinaya Master is considered the great patriarch of the Vinaya school. After the Great Yuan period, the Chinese Vinaya school was abolished and extinguished.

In our Japan during the reign of Emperor Kinmei, after Buddhism first crossed over, though monks and nuns from foreign countries and our homeland came and went through successive generations, they had not yet properly carried out the ritual procedures for ascending the ordination platform to receive precepts. They merely lectured on the Vinaya Piṭaka. However, during the reign of the forty-sixth emperor, Empress Kōken, in the sixth year of Tenpyō Shōhō, year of the wood horse (754 CE), the Chinese monk Jianzhen arrived. The imperial court and ministers rejoiced greatly, immediately establishing an ordination platform at Tōdai-ji in the southern capital, with over 430 recipients of precept-dharmas including the retired emperor, emperor, empress dowager, crown prince, and court nobles and below, and over 40,000 monks and nuns who received ordination before and after combined. The precept-dharmas of our homeland truly flourished at this time.

Monk Jianzhen initially received full ordination from Dhyāna Master Hongjing in China, received bodhisattva precepts from Vinaya Master Dao'an, and studied the Nanshan Vinaya Compendium and others from Vinaya Master Rongji. Hongjing, Dao'an, and Rongji were all disciples who received instruction from Nanshan Vinaya Master Daoxuan. Since Jianzhen's arrival at court, the various temples of the southern capital vigorously studied vinaya dharma. Properly speaking, Tōdai-ji serves as the original site of the Vinaya school. This is called the Southern Capital Vinaya. From the first Sanlun school to this Nanshan Vinaya school transmitted by Jianzhen is called the Six Schools of the Southern Capital.

Also within the Nanshan Vinaya school there is what is called Northern Capital Vinaya. Dharma Master Shunjō, the founding master of Sennyu-ji, went to Song and studied the Nanshan succession Vinaya school, returning to court in the first year of Kenryaku, year of the metal sheep (1211 CE) during the reign of the eighty-fourth emperor Juntoku of our homeland, and propagated it at Northern Capital Sennyu-ji. There are slight differences from the Southern Capital Vinaya. These are all Hīnayāna Vinaya schools of Nanshan transmission.

Next, the Tiantai Vinaya school consists of Mahāyāna bodhisattva precepts. The doctrinal meaning of the precept-dharmas and the teacher-disciple lineages are separate matters for each. Primarily they rely on the wonderful principle of the Lotus Sutra's opening and revealing, and secondarily they use the ten grave prohibitions and forty-eight minor precepts of the Brahmajāla Sutra. Vairocana Buddha on the platform, Prince Miaohaiand over twenty other bodhisattvas transmitted it in succession, and Great Masters Nanyue and Tiantai in China received and inherited it. Up until Chinese monk Daosu, Japanese Great Master Dengyō went to Tang to receive ordination, brought it back to our homeland, and established an ordination platform on Mount Hiei. During the reigns of the fiftieth human emperor Kanmu, fifty-first emperor Heizei, and fifty-second emperor Saga of our court, it was propagated across these three reigns. From that time until the present world, there has been an authentic transmission of the great precepts. This is called the Perfect and Sudden Wonderful Precepts.

The twelve-stage sequence of these Perfect and Sudden Precepts, the meaning of transmitted precepts, acquired precepts, and inherently possessed precepts, the true essence of the three collections of pure precepts, the essential principle of the single-mind precept treasury, etc., are as vast as Mount Sumeru and as profound as the great ocean. Their ultimate meaning is to realize that all precept-dharmas are inherently complete in one's own mind. Without dividing into seven groups, they are conferred universally on the four assemblies. There are those who maintain one part or ten parts. Therefore, the precept lineages among the branches of the mountain gate—Hōshō-ji, Gen'ō-ji, Rozan-ji, Nison-in, Hanshū-in, Kenkō-in, etc.—are all Tiantai Vinaya school. It is difficult to record the details here.

**7. Tiantai School**
The Tiantai school is the school that draws from the dharma-lineage of Tiantai Zhizhe Great Master. In Taizhou of China there is a mountain called Tiantai Mountain. There was a sage called Zhizhe Great Master who resided on this mountain. His original ground is Bhaiṣajyarāja Bodhisattva, a great being of the profound stage of near-perfect enlightenment, a member of the assembly listening to the Lotus Sutra on Vulture Peak. When he appeared in the world, he was an incomparable noble sage endowed with ten virtues.

In this Tiantai Great Master's judgments and explanations, he established the Four Teachings and Five Periods, clearly showing the scope of the Tathāgata's lifetime of expounding teachings. Because he properly took the Lotus Sutra as his basis, it is called the Tiantai Lotus school. Previously, with the doctrinal phases of the "three schools of the south and seven schools of the north and ten streams," successive generations of learned masters established various explanations, but they were all coarse explanations that did not clarify the Buddha's intention or exhaust the principles of dharma.

However, when Tiantai Great Master appeared in the world, he applied the great wisdom-function of self-understanding the Buddha Vehicle, clarifying the doctrinal gates of the four teachings of conversion methods, four teachings of conversion forms, five periods, five flavors, three truths, three contemplations, ten realms, ten vehicles, etc. Therefore, scholars throughout the realm saw this and clarified the great purport of Buddhism, understanding the true principle of their own minds. Truly this is the mind-mirror for practitioners, the bright lamp in the long night. Thus, serving as national teacher for two dynasties, Chen and Sui, kings and ministers bowed their heads and all people joined their palms—this is without parallel in ancient and modern times. After Tiantai Great Master, there was also...

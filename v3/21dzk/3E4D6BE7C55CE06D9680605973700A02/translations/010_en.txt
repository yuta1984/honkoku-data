During the Tang period, both transmitted the Zen school. Later, in the third year of Bunji of the reign of the 82nd Emperor Go-Toba (1187 CE), Eisai of Yōjōbō from Mount Hiei again crossed to Song China, met Zen Master Kyoan Eshō, received transmission of Zen essentials, and after returning to Japan, exclusively promoted the Zen school. From then, schools gradually divided, the five mountains and various temples were established, and the propagation of the Rinzai school flourished. Also, Dōgen of Eiheiji in Echizen Province entered Song China and brought back the Sōtō school, which spread widely throughout Japan. However, the ultimate principle of Zen dharma, though its language is lofty and transcendent, does not go beyond Tendai's "one mind, three contemplations." As evidence of this, Dharma Master's Anshin Hōmon states: "Mind is not color, therefore not existent; functioning without ceasing, therefore not non-existent; functioning while always empty, therefore not existent; empty while always functioning, therefore not non-existent." Also, according to Godaiin's judgment: "Zen dharma is one side of emptiness and signlessness among the four gates of perfect teaching." It cannot encompass and gather all opportunities. It is only cultivation for those of supreme sharp faculties. Though this school has myriads of recorded sayings and patriarchal intentions, all meanings that appear in words and phrases and reach mental thoughts are nothing but delusion. Therefore, Zen Master Dahui burned the Blue Cliff Record, showing only the single phrase "don't engage in false thinking" of National Master Wuye.

X. Pure Land School

[Page 18, Lower Section]
Generally speaking, for the faculties of foolish and evil beings of the latter age, nothing matches the single gate of Amida nenbutsu. It chooses neither the wise nor ignorant, asks not about guilty or innocent. Whether in the work of smiths and carpenters, or during the bustle of commerce and farming, if there is only faith, it is a dharma of salvation through oral recitation. In the distant past, during the time of Buddha Lokeśvararāja, when Amida Tathāgata had not yet achieved buddhahood and was called Bhikṣu Dharmākara, he contemplated for five kalpas and established forty-eight vows. These are called the transcendent compassionate vows. The eighteenth vow of birth-cause states "even ten recitations." Relying on this vow-power to practice nenbutsu, even people of sin and evil can be born in the Pure Land. One should possess the three minds: sincere mind, deep mind, and mind of merit-transference and vow-making. These three minds are naturally contained within just one faith-mind. How could ordinary beings know the mighty power of the Buddha's vows, wisdom, and practice? One should simply look up in faithful reverence. Even grave sinners of the five cardinal sins and slandering the dharma can still be born if they turn their hearts around—how much more ordinary people! However, the view that "evil creates no obstruction" should be rejected. Śākyamuni, observing the foolish people of the latter age, expounded Amida nenbutsu at various times and occasions throughout the sūtras. This is because sentient beings of this sahā world have deep karmic connections with Amida Tathāgata. Especially for Lady Vaidehī, he expounded the Contemplation Sūtra in sixteen contemplations. Within it is the meaning of nine-grade birth

[Page 19, Upper Section]
[into the Pure Land]. This sūtra is taken as especially essential. Adding the Double-Scroll Sūtra and Amida Sūtra, these form the three Pure Land sūtras. There is also Vasubandhu Bodhisattva's Pure Land Treatise. These three sūtras and one treatise serve as the foundation of the Pure Land school. They do not argue about the superiority or inferiority of scriptural teachings, but simply make according with people's faculties the essential point. There are the śrāvaka-piṭaka, bodhisattva-piṭaka, gradual teaching, sudden teaching, nature-sudden teaching, characteristic-sudden teaching, four practices, five recollections, one-practice samādhi—layers upon layers of doctrinal gates. The various schools of the holy path are difficult practice through self-power; the Pure Land school alone is easy practice through other-power. Other-power is like a common fly attached to a horse's tail crossing a thousand li, or like blue vines hanging from a pine top extending a hundred fathoms. Within the principle of the original non-characteristics of all phenomena, in order to save sentient beings not yet liberated, Amida Tathāgata through expedient means constructed the provisional Western Paradise, gathering beings of foolish and mistaken faculties to be born in the illusory Pure Land. Therefore Yang Jie said: "In the great void space are meaningless particles—mistaking the mistaken becomes the Western Paradise." Because sentient beings have the mistake of false thinking, Amida has the mistake of provisional characteristics. In true emptiness there is neither defiled land nor pure land. Sentient beings' mistakes arise from ignorance and are painful; all buddhas' mistakes arise from compassion and are endurable. It is like curing an illusory disease with illusory medicine. Speaking of this school's master-disciple lineage: Nine hundred years after the Buddha's extinction, Vasubandhu Bodhisattva composed the Pure Land Treatise. In China, during the Yongping era of Later

[Page 19, Lower Section]
Wei, Tripiṭaka Bodhiruci of North India translated that treatise. This was precisely during the Tianjian era of Emperor Wu of Liang. This should be called the founding patriarch of the Pure Land school. Next, Dharma Master Tanluan of Yanmen met Bodhiruci, received the Contemplation Sūtra, and exclusively promoted the Pure Land gate. After a hundred years passed, in the Tang period Zen Master Daochuo also exclusively cultivated Pure Land practice. From there Great Master Shandao, Zen Master Huaigan, and Dharma Master Xiaokang successively established the Pure Land school. Among them, Great Master Shandao is regarded as the fundamental patriarch of nenbutsu, being a master who attained samādhi. Hōnen Shōnin of Kurodani, Western Pagoda of Mount Hiei in Japan, seeing those five works in nine fascicles of Great Master Shandao, established the Pure Land school in the fourth year of Jōan (1174 CE) during the reign of the 80th sovereign Emperor Takakura. His fundamental intention is revealed in the Senchakushū. Comparing with the doctrines of Myōe Shōnin, there is disagreement about whether the awakening mind (bodaishin) is necessary or not. This is not something to be exhausted here. Hōnen Shōnin's disciples Shōkō, Shōkū and others are countless. What are now called Chinzei and Seizan are these. The branch schools are myriad, their doctrinal meanings like orchids and chrysanthemums. However, even in foreign lands, Tanluan and Daochuo were separated by distant ages. Japan's Hōnen Shōnin also did not cross to Song China, and because there is no direct lineage, the Genkō Shakusho classifies it as a "lodged school." Nevertheless, this school's intention is simply exclusive devotion

[study] both schools. Moreover, their teacher-disciple succession is largely the same as the lineages of both schools. The Genkō Shakusho does not include this school among the main schools but considers it an auxiliary school. Because it is a Hīnayāna school, it has no comprehensive doctrinal classification of the Buddha's lifetime teachings. Kośa is Sanskrit, translated in our country as "treasury." This treatise is called "treasury" because it embraces and contains the various excellent doctrines and literary expressions of the Jñānaprasthāna-śāstra, six supplementary treatises, and others.

**5. Satyasiddhi School**
This school reveres the doctrine of the Hīnayāna emptiness gate. Nine hundred years after the Tathāgata's parinirvāṇa, Harivarman, a brahmin's son from Central India, composed the twenty-fascicle Satyasiddhi-śāstra. India delighted in this and studied it in various places. The essence of this emptiness gate Satyasiddhi teaching uses the contemplation of three provisional aspects as illusory to refute the two truths of suffering and accumulation in correct dependent origination, enter into the equality of emptiness, and generate true uncontaminated wisdom. Because one sees truth through emptiness, emptiness serves as the gate for entering principle.

The three provisional aspects are: provisional continuity, provisional causation, and provisional relativity. The Private Record on the Mysterious Meaning of Realizing Truth, fascicle 8, states: "Although things arise and perish momentarily and return to nothingness, they continuously and provisionally exist as various dharmas, like a spinning fire wheel. Therefore they are compared to magical transformations. This is provisional continuity among the three provisional aspects. Arising from causes and conditions and being born moment by moment, it is called provisional causation. Mutually depending on each other, they are provisionally named various dharmas. This is provisional relativity. Although dharmas provisionally exist, they are provisional existence, like foam and bubbles. Therefore they are called illusory."

The essence of this school is that fundamentally there are no real dharmas of form and mind. Through the causation of ignorance, provisional combinations arise, with only the present moment existing. Originally non-existent but now existent, they ultimately return to nothingness. That self, person, and sentient beings are empty and without characteristics goes without saying. Although real dharmas are said to exist, their substance is illusory. Moment by moment they are transferred through the four characteristics and undergo birth and destruction. There is no real substance to form and mind. For example, just as existence gate abhidharma establishes that self, person, and sentient beings exist only in the present, real dharmas are established as existing only in the present. This is the essence of Satyasiddhi dharma-emptiness.

Ordinary beings and heretics develop views and思惑 through false attachment to the various dharmas of three provisional illusions and transmigrate through birth and death. Now, by contemplating through three provisional illusions that both provisional and real are empty, all afflictions are naturally remedied. That this differs from heretical annihilationism should be understood as due to provisional existence. This is detailed in the sixth [fascicle] of the Śamatha-vipaśyanā.

In China, in the thirteenth year of Hongshi of Yao Qin, year of the metal pig (401 CE), Tripiṭaka Master Kumārajīva first translated this Satyasiddhi-śāstra. All of Master Kumārajīva's disciples propagated this treatise. Later, Dharma Master Sengdao of the Song court first composed a commentary on the Satyasiddhi. His disciples exclusively studied the Satyasiddhi. There is Dharma Master Daogao's eight-fascicle doctrinal commentary. From Dharma Master Fayun of Guangzhai and others onward, it still flourished in the world. The sages of Liang and Chen each competed in composing commentaries, and the outstanding masters of Sui and Tang greatly transmitted and upheld it.

The Tiantai Zhizhe Great Master correctly judged and determined it as a Hīnayāna treatise. After the mid-period of the Tang court, those who lectured and propagated the Satyasiddhi-śāstra gradually decreased. When Buddhism was first transmitted to our Japan, the Satyasiddhi and Sanlun schools were transmitted simultaneously. Therefore, in later generations the Satyasiddhi-śāstra was attached to the Sanlun school. This is also recorded in the Enryaku period official documents. There is a sixteen-fascicle commentary on the Satyasiddhi by Dharma Master Daozang of Baekje. Sanlun school scholars of Tōdai-ji exclusively study Satyasiddhi using Daozang's commentary. In the various temples of the southern capital, wherever there is the Sanlun school, they necessarily study the Satyasiddhi school. Properly speaking, it belongs to the Sanlun school lineage of Tōdai-ji. The Genkō Shakusho also considers this an auxiliary school. It is a Hīnayāna doctrine.

**6. Vinaya School**
First, one should know the ten grave precepts of the Brahmajāla Sutra. First is the precept against killing—not killing any living beings. Second is the precept against stealing—not taking others' possessions, not even a needle or blade of grass. Third is the precept against sexual misconduct—other people's wives are of course [forbidden], but even with one's own wife, one should not engage [in sexual relations] before buddhas and deities, on days of spiritual practice, or during pregnancy. Moreover, not engaging in sexual activity is the fundamental practice. Fourth is the precept against false speech—not committing major or minor false speech. Fifth is the precept against selling alcohol—to prevent intoxicating and confusing the masses. Sixth is the precept against speaking of the faults and crimes of the four assemblies—even if there are actual faults, one should not speak of the failings of those with reputation and virtue. Seventh is the precept against self-praise and disparaging others—to avoid going against bodhisattva practices of benevolence and compassion. Eighth is the precept against stinginess and verbal abuse—one should not revile beggars when they come. Ninth is the precept of not maintaining anger and refusing to accept apologies—even if anger arises, when someone apologizes, one should listen with understanding and soften one's heart. Tenth is the precept against slandering the Three Jewels—one should not engage in slander regarding the various merits one sees and hears. These ten precepts are the essential core. One should well remember and know them. There are also forty-eight minor precepts. All are the Mahāyāna precepts of the Brahmajāla. There are also the 250 Hīnayāna precepts.

However, the current Vinaya school—vinaya is read as "law" and refers to regulations. The regulations established by the Buddha are called precept-dharmas. The lineage that exclusively reveres these precepts and vinaya is called the Vinaya school. The precept-dharmas established by the Buddha are already divided into two major categories: Hīnayāna precepts and Mahāyāna precepts. Among the post-parinirvāṇa Vinaya schools, there are two branches: the Nanshan Vinaya school and the Tiantai Vinaya school. First, the Nanshan Vinaya school is the transmission of Vinaya Master Daoxuan of Zhongnan Mountain in the Tang court. This takes Hīnayāna precepts as its primary focus while also practicing Mahāyāna precepts incidentally. One hundred years after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, the Hīnayāna precepts and vinaya taught by the Buddha were divided into five parts called the Five Vinayas, of which they exclusively [use] the first, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya.

years passed until the end of Han and beginning of Wei, when two bhikshunis from Eastern India arrived in Chang'an. Seeing the nuns' community in this land, they asked, "From whom did you receive full ordination?" The nuns answered, "We went to fully ordained monks and received the Three Refuges and Five Precepts." The two nuns sighed and said, "Bhikshunis in border regions do not yet have full ordination." They then returned to Central India (India proper) and converted fifteen people. Three froze to death in the snow mountains, and two died falling into black ravines. Only ten arrived in this land. From that time onward, all nuns went to the capital to receive full ordination. Later they went to Wu territory and gave ordination to the nuns there. From then on, the nuns' community first had the precept dharma, mutually transmitting and receiving ordination. Later three died, leaving only seven who remained for seventeen years. Longing for their homeland, they entrusted themselves to South Sea merchants and returned to their native country. Once they left, they never came again. This initial ordination only occurred at the beginning of Wei, but the exact year, month, and day have not been determined in detail. Also, calculating from the first year of Huangchu in early Wei (220 CE), year of Gengzi, there were 211 years until the seventh year of Yuanjia under Song Emperor Wen Di Yilong, year of Gengwu. There was a monk from Kashmir named Gunabhadra, which means "Merit-Armor." He was the younger son of that country's king. He came to Yangzhou and translated the Sushan jie (Good Precepts Sutra) and other scriptures. Also eight nuns from Sri Lanka came to Song territory and said, "This land has never had nuns before. How can they receive dual-assembly ordination?" Gunabhadra said, "When nuns lack the original dharma [proper ordination procedure], they obtain ordination but the monks incur fault. Examining Buddha's institutional intent, having them first perform the original dharma is precisely to generate good mind as a skillful means for receiving ordination. Discussing the dharma of obtaining ordination, the method comes from fully ordained monks. As long as the ordination ceremony succeeds, one naturally obtains ordination." Now examining this carefully, the nuns of early Wei had already received ordination, and moreover Gunabhadra was already a Westerner who was not familiar with the origins and said there was no original dharma. At that time the nuns'

community earnestly sought re-ordination. Gunabhadra said, "Excellent! I rejoice. First have the Western nuns learn the language, then go again to Western countries and invite nuns to complete the number of ten." Although Gunabhadra had previously permitted the nuns to receive full ordination again, he only translated the Bhikshuni Ordination Manual in one fascicle. The "Translated Scriptures Illustrated Records" states this was the Four-Part Ordination Manual in one fascicle. However, the ordination was not completed before he died. Suddenly it came to the tenth year of Yuanjia, year of Guiyou, when there was an Indian monk named Sanghavarman, called "Assembly-Armor." His moral virtue was pure and lofty, revered by both clergy and laity. He crossed the flowing sands to reach Yangzhou. Also three nuns from Sri Lanka including Tissara arrived in the capital, completing the required number of ten. They immediately invited Sanghavarman to be their teacher and on the ordination platform had the nuns receive full ordination again. The record by Vinaya Master Sengyou of Dinglin Temple on Zhong Mountain at the end of Qi and beginning of Liang states: "First he gave ordination to twenty-three people including Huiguo, Jingyin, Sengyao, and Zhijing of Yingfu Temple. After that, detailed records could not be kept." From then on, it was considered proper ordination. Question: What evidence proves they obtained ordination? Answer: Vinaya Master Nanshan's record states: "Long ago Emperor Wen of Wei held a great unrestricted assembly within three years. Emperor Wen asked, 'How can we know the original circumstances of how these monks and nuns obtained ordination?' All the great masters were unable to answer. At that time there was a bhikshu who requested to go to Western countries to ask about the circumstances of obtaining ordination. Arriving in Northern India, he encountered an arhat and asked, 'Did the monks and nuns of Zhendian (China) receive ordination or not?' The arhat answered, 'I am a lesser saint and do not know whether they obtained it or not.' He also told the bhikshu, 'You stay here for now. I will now go on your behalf to ask Maitreya whether they obtained it or not and return to report.' Thereupon he immediately entered meditation and went to Tushita Heaven. He asked, 'I am a lesser saint and do not know whether border regions obtained ordination or not, so I have come to ask Your Honor.' Maitreya answered concerning 'border region ordination' and requested verification. He immediately

[Upper section]
took a golden flower and made a vow saying, "If monks and nuns in border regions have obtained ordination, may this golden flower enter the arhat's hand. If they have not obtained it, may the golden flower not enter." When the vow was completed, the golden flower immediately entered his palm and a one-foot shadow appeared. Since this wondrous sign occurred, he felt joy within. Maitreya said, "When you go down to the bhikshu in Zhendian, you should also make a vow. If the ordination of Zhendian's monks and nuns is not false, may the golden flower enter the bhikshu's hand." Having immediately made the vow and finished, he pressed the flower with his hand, and it entered the bhikshu's palm with a one-foot shadow appearing. Since this auspicious response occurred, he wanted to return to his country. Then the god Kapila appeared and said, "The road is distant and has many dangers. This disciple will escort the master to reach that country." Before arriving, a golden flower first appeared in the air before Emperor Wen of Wei's palace. Emperor Wen asked the Grand Astrologer, "What strange phenomenon is this?" The Grand Astrologer answered, "Buddhist dharma from Western countries is coming here." At that time, within less than a month, the bhikshu had a golden flower in his palm, and on the day of his arrival, the golden flower in the sky immediately vanished and was no longer visible. When departing from Chinese territory, there were eighteen or more people in total. Some had deep longing for the sage and immediately went to that region; others encountered difficulties and perished; only one person survived, extensively searching ancient traces from that great park and reaching Qin. Now examining this carefully, regarding Emperor Wen of Wei holding a great unrestricted assembly within three years: if this was the former Wei Emperor Wen, it would be the third year of Huangchu, year of Renyin. Calculating those years and months, they do not quite correspond. Moreover, as stated in the "Illustrated Records of Translations" by Dharma Master Jingmai of Tang: "The monk Shi Zhiyan was from Liangzhou. He became a monk at age twenty, wore patched robes and sat in meditation, supporting himself through alms begging. At that time, in the thirteenth year of Yixi under Jin Emperor An, he defeated Later Qin and attacked Yao Hong before returning." [Hong was Yao's great-grandson; in the eighth month he was captured by Liu Yu of Eastern Jin, sent to Jiankang and immediately executed.] Duke Wang Hui of Shixing accompanied the imperial procession to observe the mountain and saw Yan in meditation.

[Lower section]
He immediately invited him to return to the capital. However, Yan had previously obtained Sanskrit texts of sutras in the West but had not yet translated them. Later, at the end of Jin and rise of Song [Liu Yu of Eastern Jin received the Jin abdication in the tenth month of the second year of Yuanxing under Jin Emperor Gong and reformed it into the Song dynasty], in the fourth year of Yuanjia under Song Emperor Wen [this spans eleven years from the thirteenth year of Yixi to the fourth year of Yuanjia], year of Dingmao, at Zhiguo Temple in Yang capital he translated the Puyao Sutra and others totaling thirty-six fascicles. However, before becoming a monk, Yan had once received the Five Precepts but had committed violations. After receiving full ordination, he doubted whether he had obtained ordination. He then sailed across the ocean to India to consult an arhat. The arhat could not decide, so he petitioned Maitreya. Maitreya answered that he had obtained ordination. Yan was extremely delighted. If we base this on the third year of Huangchu under former Wei, year of Renyin, to the fourth year of Yuanjia under Song Emperor Wen, year of Dingmao, when Zhiyan was translating, it would be 206 years. How could there be a person living over 200 years? If we speak of the third year of Huangshi under Later Wei Emperor Daowu when he established his capital in northern Dai, year of Wuxu, at that time he had not yet revered and believed in Buddhism, so who would interrogate about the origins of obtaining ordination? Moreover, Huangshi and Huangchu, Emperor Wen and Emperor Wu are all different. What ordination verification is there? Thus we know this is an error in Nanshan's record. Now examining this carefully, this refers to the third year of Huangchu under Later Qin Yao Xing (posthumous name Emperor Wenhuan), year of Bingshen [the characters "Huangchu" are different from the "Huangchu" of former Wei's Cao clan] to the fourth year of Yuanjia, totaling thirty-two years. Taking only Zhiyan's first journey to the Western Regions, he should still have been young. With the delays of going and returning, having passed another thirty-two years would immediately correspond with the "Illustrated Records of Translated Scriptures." The historical records of Qin and Wei should be examined. Question: Dharma Master Zhiyan was initially in the Qin dynasty - how did he come to translate in the Song dynasty? Now examining this carefully, Later Qin was destroyed by Liu Yu of Song, which is why Zhiyan left Qin and entered Song. Moreover, the way of monastics is to travel and teach in various regions, so there is nothing [wrong with this]. [At the time of Yan's translation in the Yuanjia years, there were six states in total: first Western Qin, second Xia state, third Northern Liang, fourth Northern Yan, fifth Later Wei, sixth Song state.] Calculating the total within this [period]:

Title: Records of the Transmission of Precepts and Vinaya, Upper Volume (including preface)
Compiled by imperial command by Monk Minor Bishop Dento Great Dharma Teacher Houan

Originally, ultimate truth is beyond words, yet through words it illuminates the teaching without teaching. The Dharma body is without form, yet through form we recognize the formless form. Thus dwelling throughout the great thousand worlds, it expounds the elegant teaching without questions. Appearing from countless kalpas past, it manifests the wonderful form of true substance. Since the Tamer (Buddha) appeared according to circumstances and the Dharma hero gained insight, the tracks of the five vehicles arose in succession, and the teachings of the twelve divisions exist side by side. Although the scriptural collections are categorized and number eighty thousand in total, in terms of removing suffering and granting happiness, the principle returns to one. Only these precepts and vinaya are the essential guard for attaining nirvana and the foundation for reaching bodhi. It is like relying on oars and rudders to cross smoothly when floating on the sea and cutting through currents, or waiting for axles and wheels when seeking through darkness toward distant places to achieve arrival. Thus sila (precepts) is the light boat for crossing the sea of suffering, and vinaya is the supreme vehicle for reaching the other shore. From this we know that stabilizing the nation and protecting families takes precepts as primary, and planting causes to attract results puts vinaya first. Truly they are the secret treasury of the Tathagata and the womb of all sages. When precepts are firmly maintained without falling, myriad good deeds arise accordingly; when precepts are violated without prevention, all practices immediately rebel. Therefore the vinaya states: "When vinaya remains in the world, the true Dharma remains long; when vinaya does not remain, the true Dharma perishes accordingly." Based on these words, the remaining or perishing of the Dharma already lies in the precepts and vinaya. It also says: "This teaching is only for fully ordained monks, not for novices to hear. Only kings are permitted to examine it, while ordinary people are forbidden to hear it." Seeing this text, in the space of profound contemplation, it is truly worthy of consideration. Humbly reflecting, Your Majesty was born with virtue from heaven, responding to the precious register to rule as sovereign, emerging from the eastern palace to ascend at the proper time,

turning the golden wheel to govern the world. You let your divine mind wander in meditative tranquility and divide your wise thoughts among Buddhist schools. Beside the rocky corridors there are sometimes places for walking meditation; below the imperial windows you personally create mountains of wisdom. Thus you cause the sun of wisdom to return from approaching dusk and kindle the torch of Dharma from near extinction. The myriad people receive protection through this, and the four kinds of beings take this as their enjoyment. Here you issued edicts to learned scholars of the eight schools, having them present the essential teachings of each tradition. This is so that in leisure from myriad affairs they may be easily examined and sought, and so that even after a thousand years the imperial grace will not decay. Houan formerly studied under teachers and entered Shotei Temple early. His heart admired the grass bonds (precepts) and his body was clothed in moksha (liberation through precepts). Growing old while contemplating this, he has simply reached senility. Mistakenly receiving the bright imperial edict, he dares to undertake compilation. He humbly fears that his understanding falls short of Monk Sho and his talent is not like Gou Senkaku - using a small ladle to scoop the sea, he instead drowns in its waves; wearing a jar to discuss heaven, he cannot distinguish its clouds and mists. He briefly records the original causes of the masters' eternal transmission after the World-Honored One's extinction, and the chronology of sages and ordinary people's emergence and spread through China and Japan, placing this at the beginning of the text. Compiled into three volumes, it is titled "Questions and Answers on the Essential Teachings of Precept and Vinaya Transmission."

The transmission of the precept dharma is divided into four sections: First, Buddha's transmission to the Western Regions; Second, sages and ordinary people's flow to China; Third, Baekje's transmission to Japan; Fourth, Tang's transmission to Japan.

Regarding the first, Buddha's transmission to the Western Regions: Question: When the Buddha was in the world, to which disciple did he first teach this vinaya? Answer: He taught it to Upali alone. Concerning the subsequent successive transmission, it has been said since ancient times: Kashyapa, Ananda, Shanavasika, Madhyantika, and Upagupta. This is the successive transmission within one hundred years after these five people's deaths. However, upon careful examination now, the five masters merely became leaders of the community and were not people who recited the vinaya collection. Question:

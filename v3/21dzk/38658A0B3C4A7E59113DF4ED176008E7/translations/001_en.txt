Record of Private Notes on the Doctrine of the One Vehicle, Volume One

Compiled by the Monk Shinkō

Question: The *Hokke Genshō* (Commentary on the Lotus Sutra), volume 4, states: "The doctrine of the One Vehicle is precisely the fundamental teaching of the sutra." How many approaches are there to clarify this One Vehicle?

Answer: The treatise states: "Now we shall roughly distinguish it through five approaches." Namely: (1) the approach of revealing the essential nature, (2) the approach of explaining the nomenclature, (3) the approach of clarifying the intention of the teaching, (4) the approach of manifesting the distinctions, and (5) the approach of clarification through questions and answers.

Question: What is the meaning of the first approach of revealing the essential nature?

Answer: Revealing the essential nature is roughly divided into three categories: (1) the all-encompassing essence, (2) the essence according to excellence, and (3) the true essence.

Question: What is the meaning of the first, the all-encompassing essence?

Answer: It encompasses all dharmas to form the essence of the One Vehicle. This is the meaning of this essence. Thus the treatise states: "First, the all-encompassing essence: all conditioned and unconditioned pure dharmas, whether seeds or manifest, whether causes or effects, fundamental or expedient, that can accomplish Buddha-virtues are all called the One Vehicle."

Question: What is the meaning of "all pure [dharmas], whether seeds, etc."?

Answer: "All" means the comprehensive meaning. "Pure" excludes the impure. "Whether seeds" refers to the seeds of the four wisdoms. "Whether manifest" refers to the manifest activity of the four wisdoms. "Conditioned" refers to the truth of the path. "Unconditioned" refers to the truth of cessation. "Whether causes" refers to the merit dharmas within bodhisattvas of sudden and gradual awakening. "Whether effects" refers to the merits of Buddha-fruition. "Fundamental" refers to the practices of sudden-awakening bodhisattvas and the Buddha-fruition stage. "Expedient" refers to the practices of gradual-awakening śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.

The meaning is: all pure seeds and manifest activities, conditioned and unconditioned, all merit dharmas of causes and effects—whether they exist within the fundamental sudden-awakening bodhisattvas and at the Buddha-fruition stage, or within the expedient gradual-awakening śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas—are comprehensively called the One Vehicle.

The *Kyōsui Commentary* states: "The seeds of the four wisdoms, the manifest activities of the ten stages. 'Conditioned' means the truth of the path. 'Unconditioned' means the truth of cessation. 'Causes' means entering Buddha-knowledge and the manifest activities of the ten stages as causes. 'Effects' means the three aspects of opening, showing, and awakening, and the three bodies of Buddha-fruition as effects. The suchness of the ten stages is called cause. The nirvana within the effect is called effect. The teaching, principle, practice, and fruition of both Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna that are pure and can accomplish Buddha-virtues are all included in this."

Upon reflection, saying "teaching, principle, practice, and fruition" in the commentary is incorrect. It should be "object, practice, and fruition," because teaching, principle, practice, and fruition are not taken as this essence. This belongs to the third essence. Therefore, this should be well understood.

Question: Why is Mahāyāna called "fundamental" and Hīnayāna called "expedient"?

Answer: Mahāyāna practice is the very substance of the One Vehicle, therefore it is called "fundamental." Hīnayāna practice is the cause for entering Mahāyāna, therefore it is called "expedient." It is like calling the dhyāna stages "fundamental" and the preparatory stages "expedient."

Question: Why does this essence only take pure merits and not take the impure?

Answer: Generally speaking, regarding essence, there is primary essence and auxiliary essence. Now the primary essence is mentioned without mentioning the auxiliary essence. Therefore, the impure is not taken.

Question: When it says "seeds refer to the seeds of the four wisdoms," what are these four wisdoms?

Answer: They are the Great Round Mirror Wisdom and others.

Question: At what stage do these four wisdoms manifest?

Answer: The Wisdom of Wonderful Observation and the Wisdom of Equality are attained at the first stage. During the ten stages, there are times of manifestation and non-manifestation. The Great Round Mirror Wisdom and the Wisdom of Accomplishing Activities are attained at the Buddha-fruition stage.

Question: Why is the truth of the path called "conditioned" and the truth of cessation called "unconditioned"?

Answer: The truth of the path is the name for the wisdom that can realize. Because it is subject to the four characteristics of arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing, it is called "conditioned." This is the meaning of impermanence. The truth of cessation is the name for the principle that is realized. Because it is free from the four characteristics, it is called "unconditioned." This is the meaning of permanent abiding.

Question: How many types should "whether causes or effects" have?

Answer: There are three correlations: (1) Among the four dharmas of opening, showing, awakening, and entering, the last one is the cause and the first three are effects. (2) The correlation between the four wisdoms and three bodies: among the four wisdoms, the Wisdom of Wonderful Observation and Wisdom of Equality are called causes (because they are attained during the ten stages), and the three bodies of Dharma, Reward, and Transformation are called effects. (3) The correlation between the ten suchnesses and four nirvanas: the suchness of the ten stages is called cause, and the nirvana of Buddha-fruition is called effect.

Question: Between this all-encompassing essence and the third true essence, which is broader and which is narrower?

Answer: The *Water Commentary* states: "The all-encompassing essence has a broad name but narrow essence. The true essence has a narrow name but broad essence. Upon hearing the term 'all-encompassing,' this name seems broad. However, because it only takes the pure and not the impure, the essence is narrow. Upon hearing the term 'true,' it immediately seems narrow. Yet it includes both pure and impure, so it is actually broader."

Question: If so, why does that commentary next say: "The all-encompassing essence has both broad name and broad essence. Within it, it encompasses the One Vehicle, Great Vehicle, and Buddha Vehicle. The reason for presenting these three essences is that both name and essence are broad. It is not the case that it only encompasses the pure and therefore has narrow essence"?

Answer: This interpretation is hard to believe. Because it speaks of "One Vehicle, Great Vehicle, Buddha Vehicle," it comprehensively includes three names. Although the names are broad, when we examine the essence, it is just one dharma. How can we say the "essence is broad"? Therefore, the former interpretation is better.

Question: Are the pure merits in the bodies of those of fixed śrāvaka and pratyekabuddhayāna nature included in this essence?

Answer: They are not included. Therefore, the *Water Commentary* states: "Regarding the all-encompassing essence, all pure [dharmas]—if they are pure, even the expedient means of Hīnayāna are taken; if they are impure, even the fundamental aspects of Mahāyāna are not taken. If they are pure [dharmas] in the bodies of those of fixed nature, they are not included in this category. Now we only take the pure [dharmas] possessed by those of unfixed nature and the pure [dharmas] possessed by sudden-awakening bodhisattvas: the inherent seeds before the stages, the pure manifest activities from the stage of entering the stages onward, and the manifest merit in the fruition, whether newly perfumed or inherent, conditioned or unconditioned, the ten suchnesses of Mahāyāna, and the unconditioned principle attained through the various categories of the path of seeing and path of cultivation in Hīnayāna."

Question: Regarding calling the unconditioned the "Vehicle," the *Water Commentary* poses the question: "The principle of cessation is eternally quiescent. How can it be called 'accomplishing'? It would be like saying that because the essence of space is permanent, it can create and act." How should this be answered?

Answer: There are two answers. First: "Because it serves as the foundation upon which myriad practices depend and is the nature of the vehicle. Just as a boat depends on water and water gains the name of 'transporting,' therefore the unconditioned is said to accomplish. Because it is an efficient cause, it is called 'accomplishing.'" Second: "Moreover, because one realizes the unconditioned principle through the portions of causes, one transports the body of the five aggregates as a conventional being and reaches Buddha-fruition. Therefore, the unconditioned is also said to be accomplishing."

Question: The treatise states: "The One Vehicle is the Great Vehicle. The Great Vehicle is the Supreme Vehicle." What does this mean?

Answer: This presents alternative names for the One Vehicle. The meaning is that the One Vehicle is also called the Great Vehicle and is also called the Supreme Vehicle.

Question: Why is it named thus?

Answer: Regarding the One Vehicle, in opposition to various vehicles, there are many names. That is, in opposition to śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas of unfixed nature, it is called the One Vehicle; in opposition to the Lesser Vehicle, it is called the Great Vehicle; in opposition to inferior vehicles, it is called the Supreme Vehicle; in opposition to the causal vehicle of bodhisattvas, it is called the Buddha Vehicle. Although the names differ, the essential nature is the same. In this treatise, three names are generally mentioned, while Buddha Vehicle and others are abbreviated.

Question: How do we know that the One Vehicle is also called the Great Vehicle and Supreme Vehicle?

Answer: The treatise cites evidence stating: "Therefore, the *Śrīmālā Sutra* states: 'The One Vehicle is precisely the Great Vehicle.' This fundamental treatise states: 'Opening is the meaning of supreme.' The *Madhyāntavibhāga* chapter on the Supreme Vehicle has three types of supremacy: (1) supremacy of right practice, namely the six right practices in the differentiated cultivation of the ten perfections; (2) supremacy of objects, consisting of twelve types of objects; (3) supremacy of cultivation and realization, namely ten types of cultivation and realization including spiritual lineage and cultivation, which comprehensively encompass all objects, practices, and fruits of bodhisattvas."

Question: Regarding the *Śrīmālā Sutra* specifically, what does it mean by saying "the One Vehicle is the Great Vehicle"?

Answer: The intention of that sutra is to call it the One Vehicle based on the meaning of Buddha-nature suchness as most excellent and ultimate. That sutra states: "The One Vehicle is the Great Vehicle. The Great Vehicle is Buddha-nature. Buddha-nature is the nirvana realm." It is called the Great Vehicle based on the meaning of pervading fullness and vast breadth.

However, in explaining the meaning of being called the Great Vehicle, there are many treatise explanations. The *Twelve Gate Treatise* uses six meanings to call it the Great Vehicle: (1) it surpasses the Two Vehicles, (2) Buddha is the greatest and this vehicle can reach [that state], (3) it is what Buddha rides, (4) it can eliminate great suffering and provide great benefit and happiness, (5) it is ridden by great beings like Avalokiteśvara, (6) it can exhaust the source and foundation of all dharmas.

The *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* states: "It is both a vehicle and great, therefore it is called the Great Vehicle—namely, the myriad practices. Or it rides on great nature, therefore it is called the Great Vehicle—namely, suchness."

Asaṅga's *Vajracchedikā Commentary* and the *Abhidharmasamuccaya* each explain seven types of great nature. Although each differs slightly, the meaning is the same. The *Abhidharmasamuccaya*, volume 11, states: "This vehicle nature, because it corresponds with seven types of great nature, is called the Great Vehicle: (1) great nature of objects—because the bodhisattva path takes hundreds of thousands of teachings as its objects; (2) great nature of practice—because it possesses the two benefits; (3) great nature of wisdom—because it understands the two selflessnesses; (4) great nature of vigor—because it cultivates hundreds of thousands of difficult practices for three great incalculable eons; (5) great nature of skillful means—because by possessing wisdom, it does not abide in either saṃsāra or nirvana; (6) great nature of realization—because it accomplishes the ten powers, four fearlessnesses, and other merits; (7) great nature of activity—because it exhausts the limits of saṃsāra and establishes Buddha-activities, it is called the Great Vehicle."

Question: How do we know from the *Lotus Commentary* stating "opening is the meaning of supreme" that the One Vehicle is also called the Supreme Vehicle?

Answer: The four dharmas of opening, showing, awakening, and entering are taken as the essence of the Wonderful Dharma. Since the Wonderful Dharma takes the One Vehicle as its fundamental teaching, "opening is the meaning of supreme"—that is, the One Vehicle. Based on this meaning, it is said that the One Vehicle is also called the Supreme Vehicle.

Question: If so, the remaining three meanings of "showing" and others are also the One Vehicle. Why can't the three meanings of "showing" and others be taken as alternative names for the One Vehicle? Why is this not the case?

Answer: This objection is incorrect. "Opening" means to simultaneously open and reveal the supreme meaning of the principle of Dharma-body nirvana and the wisdom of Reward-body bodhi, causing sentient beings to aspire toward them, therefore it is called the "meaning of supreme." The One Vehicle takes this supreme principle and wisdom of bodhi and nirvana as its essence. Therefore, the "meaning of supreme" is taken as an alternative name for the One Vehicle. The *Madhyāntavibhāga*'s term "Supreme Vehicle" has precisely this meaning. Therefore, it also cites that text as evidence that the One Vehicle is also called the Supreme Vehicle. "Showing" has the meaning of sameness, "awakening" has the meaning of not-knowing, etc.—their meanings are quite different. Therefore, they cannot be alternative names for the One Vehicle. Moreover, these names do not exist in various teachings.

Based on this one question and answer, we can definitively know. There might be a certain edition that says "only the first among the ten," which is not like the edition that includes the second. The master of the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha Commentary obtained that edition and composed this question and answer. If not so, how else could it be?

Question: How do we know such an alternative edition exists? Answer: First, we know this from the question and answer in this Mahāyāna-saṃgraha Commentary. Second, Master Ji states: "The chapter master's explanation says: 'Indeterminate is precisely the first and second among the ten, plus a small portion of the eighth. Transformation is precisely the ninth meaning. The remaining eight small portions.' Yet the sūtra commentary states (referring to this One Vehicle chapter): 'Transformation refers to the ninth meaning and other small portions.' This means taking the ninth completely, plus small portions from the remaining seven. This explanation has no problems. If one says 'remaining eight,' since the ninth has already been taken completely, there are only seven remaining. Why say eight?" Seeing this master's critical intent, there could be an edition with "remaining eight." Also, examining various editions now, there actually exists an edition with "remaining eight," which later people changed to the character "six." If we follow that "remaining eight" edition, isn't this unlike the edition that mentions the second? For now taking the first and ninth, it only says "remaining eight." Regarding this alternative edition, there is the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha Commentary's question and answer. However, Master Ji saw this and added the word "second," not changing the "remaining eight" edition, and made this criticism. Tang dynasty editions have many differences. We can only understand and reconcile them like this.

Question: What does "and other small portions, etc." mean in the next part of the chapter? Answer: The Water Commentary states: "Excluding the first, second, eighth - where the Two Vehicles obtain self-substance aspiration regarding Buddha - and the ninth, the remaining six meanings, regarding small portions, are precisely 'liberation in the body is one,' or 'dharma-selflessness, etc., nature-differences.' Regarding these small portion meanings, combining them in the same place, the One Vehicle is taught." The general meaning is: when the Lotus Sūtra teaches the One Vehicle, if based on the commentary's text about giving prophecy, among the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha's ten meanings, the One Vehicle is taught only through the

first, second, small portion of the eighth, and the ninth meaning. When broadly explaining One Vehicle meaning, it penetrates the ten causes to teach the One Vehicle (this is the meaning). Using the remaining six meanings to teach the One Vehicle is not limited only to this sūtra. It broadly penetrates One Vehicle teachings in other sūtras, generally encompassing the meaning of teaching the One Vehicle comprehensively as ten causes.

Question: In the eighth cause, excluding same-name bodhisattvas, adding the remaining six makes seven. Why say "remaining six meanings"? Answer: There are two explanations. First, because it's a small portion within one cause, it's briefly not taken. Actually, it could also be taken. Second, that is a separate meaning, so it's not taken. Saying seven would not be problematic.

Question: What does "not completely rejecting and denying determined nature, etc." mean? Answer: This text finishes explaining the deep intention of teaching the One Vehicle, first refuting ancient masters' doctrines and establishing one's own doctrine. The meaning is: Schools like Tiantai use texts such as "In the ten-direction Buddha lands, there is only One Vehicle dharma" as evidence, saying that the five vehicles are opened and united into the One Buddha Vehicle, and in ultimate truth there is only One Buddha Vehicle with no other vehicles. This is based on not knowing the ten meanings for teaching the One Vehicle. Therefore, now revealing the reason why the One Vehicle is taught through ten meanings, refuting those ancient masters' claim that "there are no determined nature or no-nature beings," and establishing that although the One Vehicle is taught, it doesn't mean the five vehicle natures don't exist. Therefore, this One Vehicle is taught secretly with intention. The Water Commentary states: "If we discuss teaching the One Vehicle explicitly, in the ten-direction worlds there are two and three. Now, specifically addressing indeterminate nature people: 'In the ten-direction worlds, there is only One Vehicle dharma, no two and no three.' If including determined nature people, then there must be Three Vehicles. Therefore, this One Vehicle is taught with hidden intention." The Abhidharma Commentary explains sentient beings' aspirations and intentions: "For indeterminate seed-nature beings, to make them abandon inferior śrāvaka aspirations, it prophesies that great

śrāvakas will attain Buddhahood, and teaches the One Vehicle with no second." This is precisely this hidden intention.

Question: The chapter states: "The Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra says: 'Characteristics, arising, ultimate - without self-nature, thus I have all revealed. If not knowing Buddha's hidden intention here, losing and destroying the correct path, unable to proceed. Therefore in this, the One Vehicle is established, not that sentient nature has no differences.'" What does this mean? Answer: The above text concluded "therefore this One Vehicle is taught with hidden intention." To reveal the meaning of teaching the One Vehicle with hidden intention, it cites the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra and Nirvāṇa Sūtra to prove and establish this meaning. This first cites the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra text.

Question: First, what is the meaning of this sūtra text? Answer: This sūtra's intention clarifies the reason for secretly teaching the One Vehicle based on the three naturelessness principles. The prose text states: "Sentient beings of śrāvaka vehicle seed-nature also through this path, this track, therefore realize unsurpassed peaceful nirvāṇa. Sentient beings of pratyekabuddha vehicle seed-nature, sentient beings of Tathāgata vehicle seed-nature also through this path, this track, therefore realize unsurpassed peaceful nirvāṇa. All śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas share this one wonderful pure path, all have this same one ultimate purity, with no second. Depending on this, I therefore teach with hidden intention, saying 'there is only One Vehicle,' but it's not that in all sentient being realms there are no various sentient being seed-natures - whether dull faculty nature, medium faculty nature, or sharp faculty nature - sentient being differences." Dunlun's Record states: "This clarifies that Three Vehicle people equally depend on the natureless path to realize and attain nirvāṇa."

Question: First, what are these three naturenesses? Answer: First, characteristic-naturelessness; second, arising-naturelessness; third, ultimate-naturelessness.

Question: How are they named characteristic-naturelessness, etc.? Answer: Conceptually constructed

【Lower Section】

is named characteristic-naturelessness because its essence and characteristics are completely non-existent. Other-dependent is named arising-naturelessness because it lacks natural arising. Perfect completion is named ultimate-naturelessness because it is free from conceptual constructions.

Question: The three nature dharmas have existence and non-existence separately. Why are they all called natureless? Answer: The Consciousness-Only Treatise reconciles this: "Although the latter two natures are not non-existent in essence, there are deluded beings who, regarding them, make false additions and wrongly cling to truly existent self and dharma natures. This is called conceptually constructed. To eliminate this attachment, Buddha Bhagavat, regarding both existent and non-existent, generally teaches naturelessness."

Question: Then depending on which nature is which naturelessness established? Answer: The Consciousness-Only Treatise states: "Depending on this first conceptually constructed, characteristic-naturelessness is established. Because its essence and characteristics are ultimately non-existent, like sky-flowers. Therefore, depending on the next other-dependent, arising-naturelessness is established. This is like magical phenomena - relying on various conditions to arise, lacking the natural nature of wrong clinging. Therefore, it's provisionally called natureless, not that its nature is completely absent. Depending on the latter perfect completion, ultimate-naturelessness is established. That is, ultimate reality, through being far removed from the previously conceptually constructed self and dharma natures, is therefore provisionally called natureless. Its nature is not completely absent. Like space pervading all colors while being the manifestation of the naturelessness of all colors." (This completes the three naturelessness meanings.)

Question: What is the meaning of the verse text cited in this chapter? Answer: The first two verse lines mean: The three types of naturelessness meanings have already been clearly taught by me for Paramārthasamudgata Bodhisattva and others. This means that regarding the three nature dharmas, to eliminate sentient beings' false attachments, naturelessness is generally taught. If this hidden intention is not known, the correct path is lost and destroyed, unable to cultivate and reach bodhi (this is the meaning). This was first cited to reveal the reason for teaching the three naturenesses. Next there are two verse lines, but the chapter text briefly cites the latter line. Therefore, the complete text says: "Depending on various pure paths...

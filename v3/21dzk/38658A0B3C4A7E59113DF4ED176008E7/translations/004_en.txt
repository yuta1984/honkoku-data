The third, "what was to be done is accomplished"—the wisdom of the truth of cessation is not yet complete; fourth, "not receiving future existence"—the wisdom of the truth of accumulation is not yet complete.

Question: The two-vehicle sages have already attained these four wisdoms, so why is it said they are not complete?

Answer: Regarding the aspect of eliminating delusions and realizing principles within their own capacity, it is said they have attained these four wisdoms. However, since they have not yet studied the Mahāyāna path of eliminating delusions and realizing principles, it is said they are not yet complete.

Question: If so, at what stage do these four wisdoms of "my births are exhausted" and so forth become complete?

Answer: They are completed at the Buddha fruition stage.

Question: If so, does the Buddha fruition possess these wisdoms?

Answer: Yes, it does.

Question: If so, why are they specifically called "two-vehicle wisdoms"?

Answer: The two vehicles are called such because they attain them within their own capacity. However, their complete and definitive attainment is at the Buddha fruition. Therefore, that sūtra states: "Having ascended to the ground of sovereignty over all dharmas, the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One correctly makes the lion's roar: 'My births are exhausted, the pure conduct is established, what was to be done is accomplished, I will not receive future existence.' This is the World-Honored One making the lion's roar, relying on the complete meaning to make a definitive declaration." The lion's roar means definitive meaning.

Question: What is the meaning of the sūtra's statement "heading toward the nirvana realm"?

Answer: The Water Commentary has three interpretations. First: "Realm means the meaning of cause. In the arhat's body, the four wisdoms as conditioned fruit-dharmas are not complete, and nirvana as unconditioned fruit-dharma is also without substance. Turning the mind toward the Great, collectively becoming causes with the Mahāyāna's three-aspect nirvana is called 'heading toward the nirvana realm.'" Second: "Realm means the meaning of nature, the meaning of seeds. Now taking the meaning of cause, precisely taking this passage's 'heading toward the nirvana realm' as proof. Therefore we know that it comprehensively takes expedient teachings, principles, etc., as causes of the Mahāyāna." Third: "Sheep and deer are without substance. This is called 'heading toward nirvana.' The phantom city is nonexistent."

Now I think that taking "realm" as the meaning of nature should be the correct interpretation, because it accords with the sūtra text's characteristics. The sūtra's next passage states: "If one knows all suffering, eliminates all accumulation, realizes all cessation, and cultivates all paths, then in the impermanent destructible world and impermanent diseased world, one attains the eternal nirvana realm." It also states below: "Those who attain the One Vehicle attain anuttara-bodhi. Anuttara-bodhi is the nirvana realm. The nirvana realm is precisely the Tathāgata's Dharma-body." We clearly know that "realm" means nature. One should not seek differently.

Question: The treatise states: "Also it says: 'Correct Dharma abiding, Correct Dharma perishing, Prātimokṣa, Vinaya, renunciation, full ordination—these six dharmas are taught for the sake of the Mahāyāna.'" What is the meaning of quoting this text?

Answer: This also quotes text explaining the expedient One Vehicle as proof of the comprehensive essence.

Question: Regarding these six dharmas in the Hīnayāna, the first four clarify the dharmas to be studied, and the latter two clarify the people who study. Why do they constitute the One Vehicle essence?

Answer: That sūtra already states "these six places are taught for the sake of the Mahāyāna." Therefore we know that formerly teaching Hīnayāna practices through expedient means was to serve as distant causes for the Mahāyāna, thus becoming proof of the One Vehicle comprehensive essence.

Question: How are "Correct Dharma abiding" and so forth named in sūtra commentaries?

Answer: The masters who explain this differ. Cien's Vimalakīrti Commentary states: "The beneficial good of the two collections of sūtras and treatises is called 'abiding,' and eliminating obstacles is called 'perishing.' The abbreviated version among the precepts is called Prātimokṣa, and the extensive vinaya version is called Vinaya. These are precisely the three-collection dharmas to be studied. The people who study are called 'renunciation and full ordination.' Zhizhou states: 'Novices are called renunciation, and fully ordained monks are called full ordination.' The people and dharmas of the two vehicles together form the six places. Zhu states: 'These six dharmas are places where practice arises, hence called places.' Since it already states they are all taught for the sake of the Mahāyāna, we know the Hīnayāna serves to create causes for the Great."

The Compendium Commentary and Water Commentary all agree with this. Prātimokṣa is called "individual liberation precepts." Vinaya is called "extinction."

The Xing Commentary states: "Correct Dharma abiding means both teachers and practitioners are present in the world. Correct Dharma perishing means if there are no teachers, it is called 'conventional Correct Dharma perishing'; if there are no practitioners, it is called 'ultimate Correct Dharma perishing.'"

Jizang's Treasure House states: "Sūtras, Vinaya, and Abhidharma are called conventional Correct Dharma. The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are called ultimate meaning. Speaking of 'abiding and perishing'—there are two kinds of abiding and perishing. First is the rise and decline of time periods, having definite time limits, hence there is abiding and perishing. Like Śākyamuni: Correct Dharma for one thousand years, Semblance Dharma for one thousand years, Final Dharma for ten thousand years. The reason for definite numbers is that this is the original vows of all Buddhas. Second, when people practice the Dharma, the Dharma abides long; when they don't practice the Dharma, the Dharma perishes. Although there are two meanings, this interpretation is properly used to encourage people to practice the Buddha-Dharma. Prātimokṣa is called 'resultant liberation'—through the cause of maintaining precepts, one attains the result of liberation. Vinaya is called 'extinction'—it means extinguishing the seven non-virtues of present body and speech, with separation from faults as the designation. In Hīnayāna dharma, receiving the ten precepts is renunciation, and receiving the major precepts is full ordination. In Mahāyāna, arousing bodhicitta is renunciation, and receiving bodhisattva precepts is full ordination."

Question: These three types of masters explain the meaning of abiding and perishing quite differently. Which should be considered correct?

Answer: Each grasps its principle, and correctness is difficult to judge. Only Cien's explanation has rather profound meaning.

Question: That sūtra's explanation states: "Mahāyāna abiding is precisely Correct Dharma abiding. Mahāyāna perishing is precisely Correct Dharma perishing." Given such textual characteristics, it seems the interpretations of Master Xing and Master Jizang accord with the sūtra text and should be correct. Why clarify Cien's interpretation?

Answer: This sūtra text does not contradict Cien's interpretation at all. The Mahāyāna's ability to generate good is called "Correct Dharma abiding," and the Mahāyāna's ability to eliminate obstacles is called "Correct Dharma perishing." Speaking of "abiding" and "perishing" both refer to functions, not the dharma-essence itself. Cien's interpretation means this.

Question: What is the meaning of the treatise's statement: "Therefore we know all fundamental and expedient, all undefiled whether seeds or manifest, conditioned and unconditioned, can accomplish Buddha qualities and are all called the One Vehicle"?

Answer: This quotes the above text explaining fundamental and expedient One Vehicle as proof, concluding the One Vehicle comprehensive essence. Regarding those undefiled manifest and seeds, conditioned and unconditioned, it is as explained above. The Water Commentary states: "Fundamental refers to the undefiled merits possessed in the bodies of sudden and gradual bodhisattvas being called the One Vehicle. Expedient refers to the undefiled merits possessed in the bodies of two-vehicle people all being called the One Vehicle."

Question: What is the meaning of the treatise's statement: "The three types of mentally-produced bodies all enter the first ground"?

Answer: This concludes the meaning of comprehensive essence. The Compendium Commentary states: "The three types refer to the two vehicles and bodhisattvas. Since it states that the two vehicles receive transformational birth and can enter the first ground, we clearly know that the merits possessed by the two vehicles are all Mahāyāna. Otherwise, how could they receive transformational birth and enter the first ground?" The Water Commentary states: "There are two meanings. First, it concludes that the previous expedient practices constitute the comprehensive essence. The meaning takes the undefiled merits possessed in the bodies of two-vehicle people as all being Mahāyāna, whereby they first receive transformation, accomplish the undefiled merits in their bodies, and later enter the first ground. Second, it comprehensively concludes that fundamental and expedient undefiled practices all constitute the One Vehicle comprehensive essence. Based on there being sovereign bodhisattvas among the three types of mentally-produced bodies, the commentary master quotes this text to comprehensively conclude the three vehicles. The commentary's latter interpretation should be correct."

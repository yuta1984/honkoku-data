intention? Answer: This objection is not correct. Revealing the Buddha's true body is especially [present] in this sutra. Therefore the ancient masters' intention states: "The followers of the Small Vehicle cling to the Buddha's transformation body as the true reward body. Now in this sutra, the true body is revealed and explained, breaking their attachment to that body. That is, breaking their attachment to the three bodies and making them enter the one real body. Like this, breaking the attachment to the Three Vehicles as ultimate, separately teaching the One Vehicle to make them enter the one. In this sutra both these matters are taught together. Therefore using analogy establishes one's own doctrine." The treatise master now objects to this, therefore establishing a valid objection.

Question: If so, then countering the objection: "In the Lifespan chapter, it teaches the true and provisional fruits of the body, dispelling doubts about the transformation body's enlightenment under the Bodhi tree being real enlightenment. Is this not breaking that transformation body to make them enter the one body? Therefore this sutra teaches both these matters together. How can this be refuted?"

Answer: The intention of the Lifespan chapter is to resolve the doubts of Maitreya and others by teaching the lifespans of the three bodies, making them know the true and transformational aspects of the body. It encourages recognizing the transformational to seek and realize the true, not teaching the one body as real in order to break the Small Vehicle's attachment to the transformation body as real and make them enter the one body. Therefore what is compared is not at all equal. Why would one draw analogies because they both teach together? Therefore the treatise master can successfully refute this.

Question: What is the meaning of the latter refutation?

Answer: The meaning states: "There are those who cling to the Two Vehicle fruits as ultimate, attaining those fruits without seeking Buddhahood. Now breaking that attachment to make them enter the One Vehicle. There are none who cling to the Buddha's transformation body as ultimate, attaining that transformation body without further seeking the real body. Now breaking that attachment to make them seek the real body. Therefore it only teaches one to break attachment to the Two Vehicles as ultimate. It does not break attachment to that transformation body as ultimate. Therefore what is used as analogy is insufficient as analogy." The Compendium Commentary states: "Not breaking attachment to those two bodies as ultimate means: addressing the people who have attachments, teaching the body as two, not that the attached-to bodies have two types. Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are the two who have attachments."

The meaning is: what the treatise calls "two bodies" refers to the transformation body attached to by śrāvakas and the transformation body attached to by pratyekabuddhas. These are called the two bodies. Their essence is one.

The Water Commentary states: "Some say the Huayan masters have this attachment, saying: 'Within the ten faith minds, one can manifest the eight aspects of becoming Buddha. Thus clinging to this body and calling it the reward body.' Therefore the commentary states: 'Also, the meaning of "none" states: not yet having attained the reward body, how could there be attachment to the transformation without cultivation? Ten faith bodhisattvas have deep faith and understanding in the consciousness-only doctrine. How could they have attachment without knowing? Later they sever obstacles. What kind of statement is this?'"

Question: What is the meaning of this Water Commentary passage?

Answer: The meaning of this latter refutation also breaks the Huayan masters. That master states: "The eight aspects of Buddhahood of tenth-faith stage bodhisattvas—they consider themselves to have attained the reward body. The Sarvāstivādins and other Small Vehicle schools also cling to that body as real. Now to break that attachment, this sutra teaches the real grasped body." The refutation means: "There are definitely none who attain the transformation body without seeking the grasped body. But not yet having attained the reward body, how could they cling to the transformation body as real and not further cultivate bodhisattva practices? Ten faith bodhisattvas have deep faith and understanding in the consciousness-only doctrine. How could they not know the manifested transformation body yet cling to it as real? If they clung to it as real, later they would further sever obstacles and realize principle. What kind of statement would that be?" Therefore that master's doctrine has no principle whatsoever and cannot be relied upon.

Question: The treatise states: "There is also an interpretation that says: 'Hearing what was taught in the past, they cling to the three as all being ultimate. Now teaching one ultimate therefore breaks the three attachments. This is because pre-ground bodhisattvas give rise [to this].'" What does this mean?

Answer: This also describes the doctrine of ancient masters—namely the doctrine of Jiaxiang and other masters.

Question: What is the meaning of this ancient masters' doctrine?

Answer: The ancient masters' intention states: "The Buddha formerly taught the Three Vehicle teaching for people of the three vehicles. Following each vehicle, they all cling to it as ultimate. Now teaching the One Vehicle therefore breaks the former attachment of clinging to the three as ultimate. Among these three vehicles, breaking the bodhisattva attachment means: pre-ground bodhisattvas cling to pre-ground causal practices as ultimate. To break this attachment, the post-ground One Vehicle is taught. Therefore it can break the three." Hence the Water Commentary states: "Pre-ground bodhisattvas cling to Mahayana causal practices as ultimate. Since this is a firmly attached mind, this too must be broken. Therefore it is because these pre-ground bodhisattvas give rise [to this]. The ancient masters' intention teaches that pre-ground Mahayana and post-ground Mahayana are different, therefore breaking attachment to the pre-ground as ultimate to give the post-ground Mahayana."

Question: Then how does the treatise master refute this?

Answer: Refuting this has many types. First is direct refutation, which has two types. Second is refutation of counter-rescues, which also has two types. Third is successive refutations, which also has two types.

Question: First, what is the direct refutation?

Answer: This has two types. The first states: "If breaking attachment to the great as ultimate, yet teaching the One Vehicle in return, further increases their illness. What is this called breaking?" The second states: "Also, when not yet having left the house, promising with the ox-cart. Already also breaking the great, after leaving the house what is given—what kind of cart is this?"

Question: What is the meaning of the first refutation?

Answer: If one says teaching and giving the One Vehicle is to break attachment to the Mahayana as ultimate, then previously having attachments is the illness. Also giving the One Vehicle further increases that illness. How can this be called medicine that cures illness? The Water Commentary states: "The ancient masters say: what is cultivated pre-ground are conditioned practices within the house. Now breaking [this] to make them cultivate unconditioned practices of post-ground outside the house. Practices within the house are the Mahayana from forty years prior. Practices outside the house are the One Vehicle at the Lotus assembly. That is, the elder proclaims the three

carts within the house. The middle and small two sons abandon the sheep and deer carts to take the ox-cart. The elder abandons the ox-cart within the house to take the ox-cart outside the house." The commentary master objects: "If clinging to the Mahayana is precisely what is needed, it does not obstruct cultivation. If Two Vehicle people cling to the Two Vehicles as ultimate, this obstructs cultivating Mahayana practices, so it must be broken. Pre-ground Mahayana bodhisattvas clinging to the Mahayana as ultimate is precisely what is needed. If one says clinging to the Mahayana is an illness that must be broken, then one should separately teach and give a fundamental sacred Mahayana sutra. If clinging to the Mahayana and teaching and giving the Mahayana further increases their illness, why would it need to be broken? Therefore the commentary states: 'If breaking attachment to the Mahayana, etc.'"

Question: What is the meaning of the second refutation?

Answer: The meaning states: "Initially within the house, for the bodhisattva son, there is promised to be an ox-cart. The bodhisattva son hears this and delights in the ox-cart to leave the house. That ox-cart is the Mahayana. But if one says breaking attachment to the great, what is delighted in—the ox-cart—is what should be abandoned. After leaving the house, what is given—what kind of cart is this? If the later cart is not another cart, then clearly one knows: attachment to the great is not broken." The Water Commentary states: "Wanting to formulate a refutation, first establishing definitively." Now considering this, this interpretation may exist. However it rather does not accord with the treatise text. This should be understood.

Question: The treatise states: "If one says giving the white ox abandons the original yellow ox, if so then one should abandon the sudden to study the gradual. The characteristics of yellow and white oxen—how do their causal practices differ? Since it returns to the original ox, this clarifies not breaking the great." What does this mean?

Answer: This breaks a counter-rescue. There are two counter-rescues; this is the first text. That is, the ancient masters, having received the previous second refutation, turn to rescue by saying: "Oxen have two colors. Within the house promising and giving a yellow ox, after leaving the house abandoning the previously promised yellow ox and further giving a great white ox. The oxen before and after are different. Taking and abandoning has no fault. Like this, making them abandon the pre-ground

abandoning the previous conditioned practices and giving post-ground unconditioned practices. Therefore it can break the three." The meaning of the current objection states: "If so, what is practiced within the house is sudden enlightenment practice. After leaving the house and abandoning this, the dharma given afterward should be gradual enlightenment practice. If not, what dharma is it? Also, the dharma compared to the yellow ox and the dharma compared to the white ox are both bodhisattva causal practices. What difference is there? Abandoning the former to take the latter is bodhisattva causal practice—the six perfections and myriad practices have no difference before and after. Therefore, if the oxen have no distinction between yellow and white, and the original white ox is given, there is no difference between beginning and end. Therefore it is clearly known that attachment to the great is not broken."

The Compendium Commentary states: "What was previously practiced was sudden dharma. After leaving the house and abandoning this, yet further授ing dharma—what is given is not gradual. What dharma is this? If it is still sudden, there is no difference between abandoning and giving. Why would abandoning and giving be necessary? If it is a different dharma but not gradual, by what means would this constitute an objection?" The Water Commentary states: "Even if one says abandoning the pre-ground to take the post-ground, since post-ground and pre-ground are both sudden enlightenment bodhisattva practices and both causal dharmas for becoming Buddha, there are no two types. In the analogy above, it should still be one."

Question: Are pre-ground bodhisattvas not broken because they have no attachments? Or are they not broken even though they have attachments?

Answer: Those who have attachments—why would they not be broken? Because they have no attachments, there is no need to break them further. Therefore the Water Commentary states: "How could pre-ground bodhisattvas have attachment to conditioned practices as real? If they have no attachments, why would they need to be broken?"

Question: The treatise states: "If clinging to one as ultimate does not contradict advancing toward the great, why would it need to be broken? Clinging to two as ultimate does not advance toward the great, therefore it should be broken." What does this mean?

Answer: This completes the refutation of the first counter-rescue and establishes one's own doctrine. The meaning states: "If clinging to the One Vehicle as ultimate does not contradict advancing toward great enlightenment, how could it be broken? Clinging to the Two Vehicles as ultimate does not advance toward great enlightenment, therefore it can be broken. Therefore only breaking two to teach one, not breaking three to teach one." The Water Commentary states: "Speaking of clinging to one ultimate means the established doctrine accords with the thesis."

Question: The treatise states: "If following positions and attaining them, immediately clinging to them as ultimate, I have not seen such attachment existing in the causal [stages] advancing toward the Mahayana. Even if one permits this and also breaks [it], there should be endless breaking. Therefore only breaking attachment to two as ultimate." What does this mean?

Answer: This breaks the second counter-rescue. The counter-rescue means: "Though clinging to the One Vehicle does not immediately contradict the great, taking the merits attained in earlier stages as ultimate, to break this one teaches and gives the merits of later stages. Therefore it breaks the great." The Water Commentary states: "They rescue by saying: 'Though clinging to one does not immediately contradict the great, yet those bodhisattvas have dharma-attachment minds. Therefore it teaches that the ten grounds sever the ten heavy obstacles. How is this not breaking the attachments of Mahayana people? In this ancient masters' doctrine, when cultivation reaches the ten faiths, one abandons the ten faiths to take the ten stages, and even attaining the ten dedications, one is unwilling to advance in cultivation. Therefore it must be broken.'"

The meaning of the current refutation states: "I have not seen such multiple attachments existing in causal positions advancing toward great enlightenment. Even if one permits having such multiple attachments and therefore breaking them according to position, there should be the fault of endless breaking. Therefore one should say: only breaking attachment to the Two Vehicles as ultimate, not breaking the great." The Water Commentary states: "If one makes it so there is endless breaking, then it is the thirty minds. What would be called 'breaking three, returning to one'?" The commentary's meaning states: "There are thirty minds in the pre-ground. Breaking them at each position would have the fault of endlessness. Therefore it is known that the great is not broken. Then what would be called 'breaking three, returning to one'? One should say 'breaking two.'"

Question: The treatise states: "Also it is not breaking attachment to four vehicles as ultimate. For those without spiritual capacity

the human and heavenly vehicles are taught. Understanding that there are four vehicles, they do not cling to them as ultimate. Clinging to two as ultimate is no different from breaking two—there are none who cling to human and heavenly vehicles as ultimate. Those who cling do not understand vehicles; those who understand vehicles do not cling." What does this mean?

Answer: This is successive refutation. There are two types; this is the first refutation. Among the ancient masters' doctrines, there may be the doctrine of teaching one to break attachment to the four vehicles as ultimate. Therefore now successively refuting this.

Question: Then what is the meaning of this refutation?

Answer: The meaning states: "The intention of now teaching one is also not breaking attachment to the four vehicles as ultimate to teach the One Vehicle. Why is this? Though in the Śrīmālā Sūtra and others, human and heavenly vehicles are taught for people without spiritual capacity, yet those who understand that there are four vehicles do not cling to them as ultimate. If among the four vehicles one clings to the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha two vehicles as ultimate, breaking this is no different from the previous breaking of two. But there are none who cling to human and heavenly vehicles as ultimate. Those without spiritual capacity cling to them as ultimate but do not understand the principles of the various vehicles. How could they be broken? Therefore this Lotus Sūtra is not directed at those people without spiritual capacity. One cannot say it breaks their attachments. If they understand the principles of the various vehicles, the sages of the three vehicles know that human and heavenly vehicles are conditioned fruits of impermanent suffering bodies and do not cling to them as ultimate. Therefore one cannot say that one is taught to break attachment to the four as ultimate." The Water Commentary states: "If people of human and heavenly vehicles without spiritual capacity do not understand vehicles, though they cling to human and heavenly as ultimate, this is not what this sūtra requires and is not broken."

Question: In that sūtra it teaches four vehicles as real and one vehicle as expedient. How could there be no people who cling to the four vehicles as ultimate?

Counter-question: First, what are those four vehicles and one vehicle?

Counter-answer: That sūtra states: "Good sons and daughters who uphold the true dharma shoulder four heavy responsibilities: namely, for beings of non-dharma who are separated from good spiritual friends, through human

and heavenly good roots they accomplish this; for those seeking śrāvaka they give the śrāvaka vehicle; for those seeking pratyekabuddha they give the pratyekabuddha vehicle; for those seeking Mahāyāna they give Mahāyāna." This is the passage teaching four vehicles as real. It also states: "If the Tathāgata follows what they desire and teaches expeditently, this is Mahāyāna. There are no two vehicles. The two vehicles enter the one vehicle. The one vehicle is the ultimate meaning vehicle." This is the passage teaching one vehicle as expedient. The meaning states: "Because the spiritual capacities of the four vehicles are each different, following their spiritual capacities, the four vehicle dharmas are taught and given. Therefore they are called real. To make indeterminate-nature two vehicle [practitioners] enter the Mahāyāna, through expedient means it teaches that there is only one vehicle without two vehicles. Therefore it is called one vehicle expedient."

Correct answer: Even so, this does not mean teaching the one vehicle to break attachment to the four vehicles as ultimate. Those without spiritual capacity, because their nature is most inferior, do not understand the principles of vehicles and are not those this sūtra addresses. Therefore they are not broken further. Clinging to the two vehicles as ultimate is broken as before, according with what I establish. If clinging to the Mahāyāna as ultimate were broken, there would be faults like the previous abandoning sudden to study gradual. Therefore it cannot be broken further. Therefore it says "also not breaking attachment to the four vehicles as ultimate."

Question: The treatise states: "If using one to oppose four, since one is expedient, one should break attachment to one and return to the four vehicles." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the language of counter-objection. If one says teaching one to break attachment to the four as ultimate, then counter-objecting one could say: "In that sūtra it teaches one vehicle as expedient and four vehicles as real. If using that one vehicle to oppose the four vehicles, since the one vehicle is expedient, one should break attachment to the one vehicle as ultimate and return to the real four vehicles. If so, the one vehicle taught in this sūtra would in turn become what is to be broken. How would this work?"

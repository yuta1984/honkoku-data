"If only taking true principle, same as the Śrīmālā Sūtra, to make it the One Vehicle, one should comprehensively use the six perfections to compare with the productive meaning throughout. Why exclude wisdom?" The meaning is: Although Śrīmālā and Lotus both explain the two One Vehicles of production and inclusion, Śrīmālā correctly takes the productive meaning as the One Vehicle essence. This is unconditioned principle. Therefore it uses wisdom for comparison to show the reason why principle is superior. This sūtra correctly takes the inclusive meaning as the One Vehicle essence. This is conditioned wisdom. Therefore it uses the merit of the five perfections for comparison to show the reason why wisdom is superior. Now examining this subtle purport, this serves as evidence for making wisdom the One Vehicle. Therefore the Water Commentary states:

Question: Lotus and Śrīmālā are both the One Vehicle. Why does that sūtra comprehensively address the six perfections, while this sūtra excludes prajñā?

Answer: The commentary states "Although this sūtra explains..." The word "although" has an indefinite meaning. The intention is that this sūtra is mostly the inclusive conditioned wisdom, and in small part it extends to the productive unconditioned principle. It is properly called the inclusive conditioned vehicle, and secondarily called the productive unconditioned vehicle. Moreover, this sūtra encompasses both principle and wisdom, with its essence-nature being broad and comprehensive. That Śrīmālā Sūtra mostly explains production and in small part explains inclusion. It properly clarifies production and secondarily discusses inclusion. It only takes unconditioned principle as the One Vehicle.

The Comprehensive Explanation states: "The commentary's 'Although this sūtra explains production...' etc. explains the underlying difficulty." ...Up to where the commentary should say "mostly" but says "this sūtra only explains production" - the word "only" is an error. It should be the word "although."

Question: How are production and inclusion named?

Answer: (This can be known when reaching the fourth section.)

Question: The Water Commentary's question states: "The agent of comparison is the five perfections. The object of comparison is unsurpassed bodhi. Why not, same as Śrīmālā, completely raise the six perfections for comparison?" How should this be answered?

Answer: The following text states: "The previous Śrīmālā Sūtra takes the unconditioned as the One Vehicle. Its essence is exclusively superior. Completely raising the six perfections for comparison, the conditioned vehicle

【Lower Section】

does not match the unconditioned. This sūtra raises merit to compare with wisdom. Therefore the five perfections are merit, and the sixth is wisdom. Merit does not match wisdom. Therefore this sūtra only raises the five perfections to compare with the sixth wisdom."

Question: The treatise states: "By means of the two kinds of Buddha-principle and fruit-wisdom being called the One Vehicle, principle congeals in original existence, separating from bonds to be called nirvāṇa; wisdom illuminates new arising, with fruit perfected to be called correct awakening. This is the great source of the four virtues, the sublime foundation of the three clarities. Therefore it is raised as that wisdom-vision. Taking principle and wisdom as the One Vehicle essence. Wisdom-nature and wisdom-characteristics are together called wisdom." What does this mean?

Answer: This concludes the meaning of "concealing the inferior and following the superior" after citing evidence above. "Principle congealing in original existence" refers to the state of being bound. "Separating from bonds to be called nirvāṇa" refers to the state of being freed from bonds. "Wisdom illuminating new arising" means arising from seeds. "Fruit perfected to be called correct awakening" clarifies the wisdom-essence. The four virtues are permanence, bliss, self, and purity - the virtues of nirvāṇa. The three clarities are: first, the clarity of recollecting past abodes (taking past realms as objects); second, the clarity of knowledge of birth and death (taking future realms as objects); third, the clarity of knowledge of the exhaustion of outflows (taking present realms as objects) - these are the virtues of bodhi. Wisdom-vision clarifies the One Vehicle essence. Because correct wisdom and true-suchness are taken as knowledge and vision, it says wisdom-nature and wisdom-characteristics are combined as wisdom. This concludes taking Buddha-fruit principle and wisdom as the One Vehicle essence.

Question: When the text says "wisdom new arising," from which of the two kinds - original existence or new perfuming - does it arise?

Answer: The Water Commentary states: "If explained comprehensively through cause and effect, only the correct position all arise from the two. Now speaking about fruit perfection, the four wisdom-seeds are all original arising. All inferior unconditioned dharmas are abandoned. Therefore when the arhat stage is already complete, it does not perfume."

Question: What is the meaning of the fourth "two functions, broad essence"?

Answer: Only taking causal wisdom as the One

【Left Page】

Vehicle - this is the essence meaning. Therefore the treatise states: "Only taking causal wisdom as the One Vehicle."

Question: First, what are these two functions?

Answer: Self-benefit as one, benefiting others as one. Therefore they are called "two functions." "Function" means carrying, which is the meaning of vehicle.

Question: This essence only speaks of taking causal wisdom as the One Vehicle, so why does the Water Commentary say "Only the principle and wisdom within the causal stage are the One Vehicle. Same as entering Buddha's knowledge and vision, in the ten stages using the wisdom of the two emptinesses of person and phenomena to realize the principle of the two emptinesses of person and phenomena"? Therefore it should be said "same as principle and wisdom" - why only say wisdom?

Answer: The treatise text is clear and the evidential texts are definite. One should not make rash judgments. It can be known as stated in the treatise.

Question: The treatise states: "In the burning house parable, 'together with the bodhisattvas and śrāvaka assembly, riding this jeweled cart, proceeding directly to the bodhimaṇḍa. Only because of causal practice.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This cites evidence to conclude and establish this essence meaning.

Question: How does this text serve as evidence?

Answer: The jeweled cart refers to causal wisdom, namely among the two wisdoms of sublime contemplation and equality, taking all-knowing wisdom as essence. Therefore this text is cited as evidence for taking causal wisdom as the One Vehicle essence.

Question: Why not take Buddha-fruit wisdom?

Answer: Since it already says "bodhisattvas and two-vehicle practitioners ride this jeweled cart to reach the bodhimaṇḍa," it speaks of causal wisdom.

Question: If so, why does the Profound Commentary say "The Buddha-fruit ox-cart takes the all-knowing wisdom among the four wisdoms as its nature, namely subsequently-attained wisdom"?

Answer: After reaching the bodhimaṇḍa, it speaks of "Buddha-fruit ox-cart." This does not mean that is not the One Vehicle essence. Now it only exclusively takes causal practice, therefore citing the text that only explains causal practice.

Question: Why not take direct wisdom, using subsequently-attained wisdom as the cart?

Answer: Direct wisdom is compared to the ox, being in front of the cart. Subsequently-attained wisdom is compared to the cart, being behind the ox. Therefore the Profound Commentary states: "Non-discriminating wisdom guides this all-knowing wisdom

【Lower Section】

in meaning, like the ox in front, not being the true cart essence."

Question: What people are those bodhisattvas and śrāvakas?

Answer: Bodhisattvas are first stage and above, non-regressing bodhisattvas. Śrāvakas are turning-mind four-fruit sages. The sūtra only mentions śrāvakas and abbreviates pratyekabuddhas, but logically they must exist. Therefore in the Consciousness-Only treatise, taking the meaning it says: "Śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and non-regressing bodhisattvas ride this jeweled cart, proceeding directly to the bodhimaṇḍa." These are the distinctions of the three types of mind-made bodies explained in the Śrīmālā Sūtra.

Question: Where is the bodhimaṇḍa?

Answer: The Buddha stage. The Profound Commentary has three explanations. First: "The place where bodhi and nirvāṇa accumulate and generate the path is called bodhimaṇḍa." Second: "Because delusion rides the causal vehicle of all-knowing wisdom, it reaches the bodhimaṇḍa of great parinirvāṇa in the Buddha stage." Third: "Or reaching the true-suchness bodhimaṇḍa of Buddha-fruition."

Question: What is the meaning of these three explanations?

Answer: The first explanation means bodhi and nirvāṇa together are called bodhimaṇḍa. The second explanation means only nirvāṇa is called bodhimaṇḍa. The third explanation means true-suchness is called bodhimaṇḍa.

Question: What difference is there between nirvāṇa and true-suchness?

Answer: One essence without difference. But true-suchness is one type with essence pervading everywhere. Nirvāṇa, according to meaning, has four types in essence. Buddha-fruit true-suchness has no difference from the causal stage. Buddha-fruit nirvāṇa has difference from the causal stage. Due to this difference, the latter two explanations are made.

Question: How does Buddha-fruit nirvāṇa differ from the cause?

Answer: Ordinary beings and two-vehicle learners only have the first self-nature pure nirvāṇa. Indeterminate-nature two-vehicle non-learners have the first and second nirvāṇa-with-remainder. Determinate-nature two-vehicle non-learners have the first, second, and third nirvāṇa-without-remainder. Direct-path bodhisattvas have the first and...

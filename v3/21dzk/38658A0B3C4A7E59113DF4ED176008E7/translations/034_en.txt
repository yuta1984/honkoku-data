According to the doctrine: "Those of dull capacity enjoy the lesser dharma, are attached to birth and death, and among the countless Buddhas, do not practice the profound and subtle path. Being disturbed by various sufferings, nirvana is taught for them." The Xuanzan states: "Because they diligently seek to escape suffering, the two-vehicle nirvana is initially taught for them." Here saying "I established these expedient means" refers to the next explanation of the doctrine of "causing to dwell" in the six predictions, pointing to the above statement "nirvana is taught for them" and saying "I established these expedient means." Therefore we know that expedient means refers to two-vehicle nirvana.

Question: The treatise states "Śrīmālā also said: 'These six places are taught for the sake of Mahāyāna.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the third proof.

Question: How does this prove it?

Answer: The six places refer to the abiding of true dharma, etc. - these are Hīnayāna practices. Yet it already states "taught for the sake of Mahāyāna." Clearly we know that two-vehicle practice is bodhisattva practice. Therefore this can establish the proof of unifying practice as one.

Question: The treatise states: "Therefore we know that practice is the same while cultivation differs. The three vehicles' cultivation has partial and complete." What does this mean?

Answer: This concludes and establishes the doctrine of unifying practice as one. "Partial" refers to the two vehicles only contemplating personal emptiness and cutting off afflictive obstructions. "Complete" refers to bodhisattvas contemplating both emptinesses and cutting off both obstructions.

Question: The treatise states: "Fourth, unifying fruit. Below in this sūtra it says 'For the sake of rest, two are taught; a provisional city is established on the middle path to lead them to the treasure location as the ultimate destination.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the fourth aspect, clarifying unifying fruit as one. Three proof texts are used to establish this doctrine. This is the first proof.

Question: How does this text establish the doctrine of unifying fruit as one?

Answer: Teaching that two-vehicle nirvana exists is to stop the regression of bodhicitta - it is established as expedient means. In reality it is to enable reaching Buddha-fruit. It is like establishing a provisional city on the middle path to rest the extremely weary multitude and enable them to reach the treasure location. Therefore we know the ultimate fruit is one. Through expedient means it teaches that two-vehicle nirvana exists. This is called unifying fruit as one. Therefore citing this text can prove and establish that doctrine.

Question: The treatise states: "Seeking the ox-cart, they exit the burning house; provisional sheep and deer carts are established, but later all receive ox-carts." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the second proof.

Question: How does this prove it?

Answer: Teaching that two-vehicle omniscience exists is to enable obtaining Buddha-fruit omniscience - it is established as expedient means. It is like enabling them to take ox-carts and exit the burning house by provisionally teaching that sheep and deer carts exist. Two-vehicle omniscience only has name but no substance. In reality there is only one type of Buddha wisdom. Just as sheep and deer carts only have names but no substance, in reality there is only one type of ox-cart. Therefore this text can establish the doctrine of unifying fruit as one. The Compendium Commentary states: "Although the two sons seek sheep and deer carts to exit the house, the Buddha's original intention is to enable them to take out ox-carts. Establishing sheep and deer wisdom is the gradual approach to the ox-vehicle. The commentary establishes the Buddha's intention saying 'exiting the house for the ox-cart.'"

Question: The treatise states: "Śrīmālā also said: 'The four wisdoms of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are not ultimate, called "approaching the nirvana realm."'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the third proof.

Question: How does this prove it?

Answer: Two-vehicle people claim to have attained the four wisdoms of "my births are finished" etc. and realized nirvana, yet it teaches that two-vehicle four wisdoms are not ultimate and are called "approaching the nirvana realm." Therefore we know two-vehicle fruit is provisional establishment through expedient means. Later when reaching Buddha-fruit, the four wisdoms become ultimate and realize great nirvana. Therefore we clearly know that actual fruit is one type. Therefore this text can establish the doctrine of unifying fruit as one.

Question: The treatise states: "Thus unifying the principle and wisdom of two-vehicle bodhi and nirvana, all return to One Vehicle. Therefore we know

that fruit is the same while realization differs. The three vehicles have earlier and later in taking fruit." What does this mean?

Answer: This concludes citing proof texts and explains the teaching's intention, successfully establishing the doctrine of unifying fruit as one. The Water Commentary states: "The meaning is that the three vehicles ultimately all return to one Buddha-fruit. Also like four great rivers all returning to one ocean. Sudden-awakening bodhisattvas take Buddha-fruit first; gradual-awakening bodhisattvas take Buddha-fruit later."

Question: The treatise states: "Although depending on various teachings we generally unify these four, in the Lotus Sūtra, teaching and principle are manifestly unified while practice and fruit are secretly unified." What does this mean?

Answer: Above, generally depending on teachings like the Lotus and Śrīmālā, the four dharmas of teaching, principle, practice and fruit were unified, each having only one type, explaining why people who receive, realize, cultivate and attain them have different capacities. Now specifically within one sūtra, it clarifies unifying teaching, principle, practice and fruit.

Question: First, within one sūtra, how does it clarify unifying those four teachings etc.?

Answer: First, within this Lotus Sūtra, this sūtra manifestly unifies teaching and principle while secretly unifying practice and fruit. The Water Commentary states: "If we follow the sūtra text, then teaching, principle, practice and fruit are all clear. If we follow the underlying logic, then there is manifest unification of teaching and principle, secret unification of practice and fruit."

Question: Therefore this sūtra manifestly unifies teaching and principle while secretly unifying practice and fruit?

Answer: The Water Commentary states: "First, the Lotus Sūtra takes provisional and real as its foundation. Opening the provisional and revealing the real - this is precisely how Lotus śrāvakas abandon the small and return to the great, all due to opening the provisional and revealing the real. Opening the provisional and revealing the real occurs on the level of teaching and principle, not practice and fruit. We see it teaches 'only leading all beings with provisional names,' not teaching 'leading all beings with provisional practices and fruits.' Therefore it is called manifestly unifying teaching and principle, secretly unifying practice and fruit."

Question: How are they called manifest and secret?

Answer: The Water Commentary states: "There are two meanings. First, what the sūtra text makes clear is called manifest unification; what is not clear is called secret unification. Second, what is taught in the sūtra is called manifest unification; what is not taught in the sūtra is called secret unification. I now consider that among the two meanings, the first is better. The second does not accord with the treatise text." Also regarding clarifying this doctrine of manifest and secret unification, the commentary's textual meaning is quite extensive. It is doctrine outside the treatise. Therefore it is all abbreviated. Readers should understand this.

Question: The treatise states: "Unifying teaching and principle means: the previously mentioned 'Buddha wisdom and wisdom gates' - 'one rain universally moistening' unifies teaching; 'ox-cart and treasure location' unify principle. This takes what is signified and calls it principle - it is not necessarily suchness." What does this mean?

Answer: As stated above, this sūtra manifestly unifies teaching and principle. Now it is clarifying the text that unifies that teaching and principle.

Question: How do these texts clarify manifestly unifying teaching and principle?

Answer: "Buddha wisdom" is the profundity of realization wisdom. This is signified principle, not signifying teaching. This does not unify principle, nor does it unify teaching. It is merely carried along by the force of the words. If used, it should be text unifying principle, but following verbal convenience it appears within text unifying teaching. "Wisdom gates" is the profundity of scripture. This is signifying teaching, immediately showing that former three-vehicle teaching is provisional and revealing that present One Vehicle teaching is real. Therefore it is called manifestly unifying teaching. "One rain" is correct teaching, showing that although Buddha's teaching is one, what it affects differs. Therefore it is also called manifestly unifying teaching. These two types above all clarify signifying teaching. Therefore they are called unifying teaching. "Ox-cart" is Buddha-fruit bodhi omniscience. "Treasure location" is Buddha-fruit nirvana true principle. Now it reveals that sheep and deer carts are expedient means for taking ox-carts, and provisional cities are expedient means for reaching treasure locations - in reality there is only one ox-cart and treasure location. Therefore it is called manifestly unifying principle. These two types above all clarify signified principle. Therefore they are called unifying principle. The next text states: "This takes what is signified and calls it

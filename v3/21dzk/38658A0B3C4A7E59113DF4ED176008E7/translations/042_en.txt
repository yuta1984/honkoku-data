[Śāri]putra is called undetermined-nature. However, among those with the same name there are many types, including determined-nature and emanation Śāriputra. I now privately doubt that the judgment that there are determined-nature and emanation types among those with the same name is not clear. Why is this? Those with the same name refer to bodhisattvas named Śāriputra - how can these be called emanation śrāvakas? Also, are determined-nature ones śrāvaka determined-nature or bodhisattva determined-nature? If bodhisattva determined-nature, it would be reasonable, since these are bodhisattvas. But what trouble is there in calling them determined-nature Śāriputra? If śrāvaka determined-nature, this would not be reasonable, since those with the same name are only bodhisattvas. Therefore, judging three types of Śāriputra based on the Compendium text is something not yet fully clear.

Question: Why not believe the patriarch's judgment? Answer: I am foolish and do not believe it. However, the Compendium text does not broadly speak of explaining three types of Śāriputra elsewhere. If this now refers to what is explained in this eighth cause, its meaning is not clear. When Śāriputra receives prophecy, there are same-named bodhisattvas who also attain the intention of receiving prophecy. If these same-named bodhisattvas are emanations, what trouble is there in gathering and attaining the intention of receiving prophecy? Explaining the ninth cause would be quite useless. Also, if there are determined-nature śrāvaka Śāriputras, how could they attain the intention of receiving Buddha-prophecy? While not grasping the patriarch's deep meaning, I do not clarify this point. I should further respectfully inquire of the master.

Now, to further reconcile the original master's meaning: based on texts from three sources, three types of Śāriputra are presented. That is, based on the Mahāyāna Entry Treatise and Bodhi Equipment Treatise texts, it speaks of transformed Śāriputra; based on the Compendium of Mahāyāna text, it speaks of bodhisattva determined-nature Śāriputra; based on Lotus chapter two text, it speaks of undetermined-nature Śāriputra. To present these three types, it cites each respective text. It does not mean that based on the Compendium of Mahāyāna there are three types of Śāriputra. Making this reconciliation now deeply accords with Cízhōu's (Cí'ēn Master's) original intention.

Question: Then what are those texts from three sources? Answer: The Mahāyāna Entry Treatise states: "The twelve hundred people are all transformations." The Bodhi Equipment Treatise states: "The Śāriputra explained in the Lotus Sūtra is the Buddha-bodhisattva's transformation." The old Compendium Treatise states: "Buddha transforms and creates śrāvakas like Śāriputra, giving prophecies for them" (this treatise text explains the ninth cause). Also, the Inconceivable Realm Sūtra states: "At that time, one hundred thousand bodhisattvas from other realms manifested śrāvaka forms and came to the assembly seats. Their names were Śāriputra, Ānanda, and others." These texts all explain emanation śrāvakas.

The Compendium states: "Also at this assembly there are bodhisattvas whose names are the same as those [śrāvakas], who receive prophecies." This text explains bodhisattva determined-nature Śāriputra. The same treatise's preceding text states: "At the Lotus assembly, with various śrāvakas like Śāriputra, receiving Buddha-prophecies." Lotus chapter two states: "Formerly at the place of twenty thousand million Buddhas, I taught and transformed you, causing you to completely forget," etc. These texts explain undetermined-nature Śāriputra.

Question: Then are there these three types of Śāriputra at the Lotus assembly? Answer: Yes. Question: Why is this so? Answer: When Buddha teaches this sūtra, bodhisattvas before the grounds see the transformation-body Buddha dwelling in impure lands teaching this sūtra; bodhisattvas on the grounds see the enjoyment-body Buddha dwelling in pure lands teaching this sūtra. The śrāvakas of transformation-body lands are actually bodhisattva transformations; the bodhisattvas of enjoyment-body lands are actually śrāvaka transformations. Since it follows the superiority and inferiority of those who see, within one assembly there are pure and impure distinctions. Therefore among bodhisattva and śrāvaka types there are respectively expedient and real. One should clearly know that at the Lotus assembly there are these three types of Śāri-

putra and others.

Question: Then why doesn't the sūtra explain that there are transformation Śāriputras? Also, if pure and impure are combined in one assembly, how can one judge that before the Jewel Stupa chapter is explanation for impure lands, and after is explanation for pure lands? Answer: Following what one type of undetermined-nature two-vehicle practitioners see, it does not explain that there are emanation Śāriputras and others. Also, the compiler does not mention both, but only explains the types seen in common by the three vehicles. However, judging impure and pure before and after is because before the three groups have not yet received prophecies, they are still śrāvakas, so they only see impure land characteristics. After receiving prophecies, they become bodhisattvas, so they should see pure land characteristics. Therefore, following what this one type sees before and after, impure and pure lands are judged. The deep meaning of this sūtra is definitely like this.

Question: Then Pūrṇa is an emanation śrāvaka - why can Śāriputra and others see him? Also, is he in the impure land explanation? Answer: To tame and subdue one type of śrāvakas to be taught, various Buddhas and bodhisattvas become their same type, manifesting śrāvaka bodies. This does not prevent this one person being in impure lands enabling same-dharma practitioners to see. Transformation śrāvakas in pure lands are not like this - they are only to manifest the virtue of Buddhas' perfect assistance. Therefore there is no contradiction. Saying "expedient ones necessarily lead real ones" speaks about transformation lands. One should know this well (this should be studied through the Buddha-Land Treatise, Supreme Commentary, etc.).

Question: Are the Śāriputra present at the Avataṃsaka assembly and the Śāriputra receiving prophecy now the same or different? Answer: The Profound Praise states: "The Śāriputra mentioned at the beginning of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra is emanation. The later Śāriputra in the Dharmadhātu chapter, leading six thousand disciples, emerges from his own chamber. Mañjuśrī explains ten dharmas for him, whereupon he arouses bodhi-mind. This is the one receiving prophecy in this [Lotus], so he is not emanation."

Question: What type is the Śāriputra who is like deaf and blind in this? Answer: Many ancient masters say: "The emanation Śāriputra of the initial assembly, to show the dharma's profundity, manifests being like deaf and blind." I think this is not so. The Tuṣita Birth Sūtra Commentary states: "For instance, what Mañjuśrī sees is the other-enjoyment body; what Śāriputra sees becomes the transformation body. Therefore at the Avataṃsaka assembly, Śāriputra is like deaf and blind, not hearing or seeing. Mañjuśrī leads him out of the assembly, and then he begins to know and see."

Jǐngxìng's Dharma Garden Record states: "The meaning is that at the time of entering the dharmadhātu earlier, his faculties were not yet mature so he did not understand the one vehicle. When Mañjuśrī explained ten dharmas for him, his faculties had already matured, so he aroused the supreme mind. This corresponds to the undetermined śrāvakas when the Lotus Sūtra explains the Skillful Means chapter, understanding the one vehicle."

Therefore one should know that being like deaf and blind refers to the present actual-practice Śāriputra, not an emanation. However, regarding the Avataṃsaka Sūtra, there are two meanings for initial assembly and later assembly. First, among the eight assemblies, the very first assembly is called initial assembly, and the subsequent assemblies are called later assemblies. This generally divides the initial and later assemblies among the eight assemblies (the new sūtra has nine assemblies). Second, regarding the final Dharmadhātu chapter, there are root and branch. The root is called initial assembly, the branch is called later assembly. When the Profound Praise says "the initial assembly Śāriputra is emanation," it points to the very first assembly, not the initial assembly of the Dharmadhātu chapter. Therefore the Water Commentary states: "In the Bhadracarī chapter first assembly, there is one Śāriputra who is transformation, since at that time śrāvakas had not yet been transformed."

Question: How do we know this? Answer: The real Śāriputra, through Aśvajit, had not yet been transformed and brought along. Therefore we know this is transformation. Later in the Dharmadhātu chapter, Śāriputra leads six thousand disciples, emerges from his own chamber, Mañjuśrī explains ten dharmas for him, and he arouses bodhi-mind. This present one receiving prophecy is that one.

Separately interpreting the first four phrases. Next, using the various phrases below in the sūtra, these four phrases are matched twice, and the meaning within these two instances is interpreted. This text is the second phrase of the first instance. The interpretation of its meaning is as stated in the Profound Commentary cited above.

Question: The treatise states: "The irreversible bodhisattvas, their number like the Ganges sands, with one mind together contemplating and seeking, cannot fathom Buddha-wisdom." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the second proof. The fourth phrase of the sūtra's correct text states "also cannot know." What the treatise cites is the text above the fourth phrase. It cites according to the meaning.

Question: What is the meaning of this text?

Answer: When the treatise quotes the sūtra and interprets the profundity of the wisdom-gate āgama, there are eight profundities. The eighth is the profundity of activities and maintenance not shared with śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. The current sūtra's prose section lacks this, but it exists only in this verse section. Within the nine-and-a-half lines of text, this is the final text clarifying that ground-level bodhisattvas do not know. Therefore the Profound Commentary states: "The previous gate's profundity has these eight types. Now in the eighth, praising Buddha-wisdom reveals the profundity of wisdom. Therefore that gate is also deep."

Question: What ground is that irreversibility?

Answer: There are two meanings. First: first ground and above, namely certification irreversibility. Second: eighth ground and above, namely practice irreversibility.

Question: How is it that irreversible bodhisattvas do not know Buddha-wisdom?

Answer: Because they cannot perfectly realize it, they are said not to know. This does not mean they do not have faith-knowledge. Also, when equal-enlightenment ground bodhisattvas see wonderful-enlightenment Buddha-wisdom, it is like seeing the moon through gauze - because it is not clear seeing, they are said not to know.

Question: The eighth profundity only speaks of not being shared with the two vehicles and does not concern bodhisattvas. Why then add that bodhisattvas do not know to clarify this profundity?

Answer: The logical force extends broadly, and there is also no objection.

Question: If so, how is it that when explaining entry-profundity above, it states "except for those among the bodhisattva assembly whose faith-power is firm," clarifying the reason bodhisattvas can know?

Answer: The meanings are different. Entry-profundity means that because the meaning of the names, words, and phrases of the Buddha's taught dharmas is difficult to obtain, it is suddenly difficult to enter and understand. Therefore it is called deep-entry. First ground and above bodhisattvas obtain the four kinds of purified faith and believe in Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and precepts, therefore they can believe in the wonderful Dharma. However, they still cannot perfectly realize it. Therefore there is no contradiction.

Question: The treatise states: "The wisdom essence is mostly fundamental and subsequently-attained. If in the causal stage, wisdom is inferior and consciousness strong. In the fruition stage, wisdom is strong and consciousness inferior." What does this mean?

Answer: Having completed the above proofs, this concludes that Buddha-wisdom is made the One Vehicle essence.

Question: Why does it say "wisdom essence is mostly fundamental and subsequently-attained"?

Answer: There are three types of wisdom: preparatory, fundamental, and subsequently-attained. To distinguish preparatory wisdom, it says "mostly fundamental and subsequent."

Question: Why is preparatory wisdom not taken?

Answer: Wisdom takes decisive judgment as its essence and uses severing afflictions and realizing principle as its function. However, preparatory wisdom cannot make decisive judgments and cannot sever afflictions or realize principle. It only subdues the manifest activity of afflictions, seeks the true-suchness to be realized, and guides fundamental wisdom, but has not yet accomplished this, so it is not the essence of correct wisdom. Therefore it is excluded.

Question: How are fundamental wisdom and subsequently-attained wisdom named?

Answer: Speaking about Buddha-fruition: the vajra-like uninterrupted path severs obstacles, the liberation path realizes principle, the realized and the realizing are equal, with equality having no discrimination at all. This is called fundamental wisdom. Because this wisdom is the true essence-nature, it is called "fundamental essence." Because it is the root of this wisdom, it is called "fundamental." After principle and wisdom unite mysteriously and self-benefit is completed, due to the original vow of great compassion for benefiting others, the expedient gate is manifested, the functions of the four wisdoms are aroused, enjoyment and transformation bodies are created, and various dharmas are expounded. This is called subsequently-attained wisdom. Because it comes after the fundamental essence, it is called "subsequently-attained."

Question: Regarding the four wisdoms of Buddha-fruition, do they all possess these two wisdoms?

Answer: The first three definitely possess both fundamental and subsequent wisdoms. Regarding the accomplishing-activities wisdom, there is debate between two masters. Bodhisattva Dharmapāla says: "Only subsequently-attained wisdom exists; fundamental wisdom does not exist." Therefore the Yogācāra treatise states: "Arising according to intention, taking phenomenal realm as object, and initiating transformative functions, it is included in subsequently-attained wisdom." Bodhisattva Jñānagupta says: "It possesses fundamental wisdom. Otherwise the Tathāgata would not be perfectly autonomous."

Question: Which of these two masters is correct?

Answer: Right and wrong are difficult to judge.

Question: What is the meaning of "if in the causal stage, wisdom is inferior and consciousness strong"?

Answer: "Cause" refers to the defiled stage; "fruit" refers to the pure stage. In the defiled stage, consciousness's discriminating function is strong and wisdom's analytical function is weak, because consciousness has not yet been transformed into wisdom. In the pure stage, wisdom's analytical function is strong and consciousness's discriminating function is weak, because consciousness has already been transformed into wisdom. Therefore the Yogācāra treatise states: "Also, in the defiled stage wisdom is weak and consciousness strong; in the pure stage wisdom is strong and consciousness weak."

Question: If in the causal stage consciousness has not yet been transformed into wisdom, why is there inferior wisdom? If in the pure stage consciousness has already been transformed into wisdom, why is there inferior consciousness?

Answer: Wisdom is the mental factor of insight among the object-determining mental factors. Consciousness refers to the eight consciousness-kings. Therefore it says "though inferior in the defiled stage, there is also wisdom." In the fruition stage, when the mind-kings and mental factors all become pure, the insight mental factors corresponding to consciousness further become the four wisdoms. However, the pure eight consciousnesses do not lose their essence. Therefore it says "though inferior in the pure stage, there is also consciousness."

Question: If so, both cause and fruit have consciousness and wisdom. Why determine superior and inferior?

Answer: In the defiled stage, clear insight has not yet been attained, so wisdom's analytical function is inferior. At this time consciousness's discriminating function is superior. In the pure stage, clear insight has already been attained, so the analytical function is strong. At this time consciousness's discriminating function is inferior.

Question: If it says there is consciousness in the fruition stage, why say "transform consciousness to attain wisdom"?

Answer: Because the insight mental factors corresponding to that transformed consciousness become wisdom, it says "transform consciousness attain wisdom." It does not mean transforming the consciousness essence, so there is no contradiction.

Question: If so, how can it say "transform consciousness"?

Answer: Because it transforms the defiled to become pure and consciousness is primary, it says "transform consciousness." Therefore the Yogācāra treatise states: "Though wisdom is not consciousness, it depends on consciousness for transformation. Because consciousness is primary, it speaks of transforming consciousness to attain [wisdom]." Also, to encourage sentient beings to abandon defiled consciousness and attain pure wisdom, it therefore says "transform consciousness." Therefore the treatise states: "To encourage sentient beings, depending on wisdom to abandon consciousness, it therefore speaks of transforming the eight consciousnesses to attain these four wisdoms."

Question: Are these four wisdoms all attained at the Buddha-fruition stage?

Answer: The two wisdoms of wonderful observation and equality-nature are attained at the first ground. However, during the cultivation path, there are occasional interruptions. The two wisdoms of great perfect mirror and accomplishing-activities are attained at the Buddha-fruition stage. Therefore in the Buddha stage, all four wisdoms are possessed.

Question: How are the types distinguished regarding these four wisdoms?

Answer: The Water Commentary states: "Fundamental and subsequently-attained are the wisdom characteristics, true-suchness is the wisdom nature, corresponding merits are the wisdom companions, and the realms of conventional and ultimate truth are called wisdom objects. Therefore, not taking wisdom from the causal [stage], only taking wisdom from the fruition [stage] as the One Vehicle essence."

Question: What is the meaning of the third "concealing inferior following superior essence"?

Answer: Contrasting cause and fruit, concealing the inferior principle and wisdom in the causal [stage], taking the superior principle and wisdom in the fruition [stage] as the One Vehicle essence. This is the meaning of this essence.

Question: The treatise states: "The sūtra below itself says 'explaining Buddha-wisdom,' therefore all Buddhas appear..."

It says "secretly there are actually four." All do not contradict. However, speaking of "manifest harmonizing" and "secret harmonizing" differs in various places. This is because taking texts to establish meanings is not uniform. In the One Vehicle Chapter, taking the texts of the wisdom gate and "one rain universally moistening," it names this "harmonizing teachings," which is the same as this chapter. Taking the texts of ox-cart and treasure location, it names this "harmonizing principles." This chapter does not take from within manifest harmonizing, but from within "secretly having four," taking texts like "I establish these expedient means" and "riding this treasure vehicle," naming this "secretly harmonizing practices." In this chapter, the first text is taken (this expedient means refers to the nine divisions). This text is abbreviated. However, that chapter calls it "secret" while this chapter calls it "manifest." These are each one-sided or interpretative, and do not contradict. Taking the text "establishing a transformation city in the middle to lead them to the treasure location," this is named "secretly harmonizing fruits." In this chapter, the three carts represent fruit. When it calls it "secret" or "manifest," this is also one-sided interpretation. One should not say they contradict.

Question: Selecting and discarding the four dharmas to judge manifest and secret is quite different. Why should one not say they contradict?

Answer: Selecting and discarding those four dharmas to judge manifest and secret follows texts and follows meanings, not being merely uniform. Therefore, that One Vehicle Chapter raises one interpretation, while this Various Vehicles Chapter raises one interpretation. This is precisely subtly explaining the sutra's meaning, not contradicting in various places.

Question: What does "secretly there are actually four" mean?

Answer: Since practices and fruits are precisely the principles being explained, they are included within practices and fruits. Therefore it says "secretly there are actually the four of teaching, principle, practice, and fruit." Master Pearl says: "The principles being explained already pervade practice and fruit, therefore it says 'secretly there are actually four.'"

Question: What does "like the Nirvana Sutra, explained as same and different" mean?

Answer: Above, contrasting Śrīmālā and Lotus, it clarified that harmonizing the four dharmas has same and different aspects. Likewise contrasting the Nirvana Sutra and Lotus, there should be same and different aspects.

[Lower Section]

Master Pearl says: "Nirvana harmonizes principle, practice, and fruit. Therefore Nirvana 3 states: 'All sentient beings equally possess Buddha-nature, all share one vehicle, one liberation, one cause one fruit, share one sweet dew, all should attain permanence, bliss, self, and purity. This is called one flavor.' Explaining: 'equally possessing Buddha-nature' harmonizes principle. 'One cause one fruit' harmonizes practice and fruit. Manifestly showing only principle, practice, fruit; secretly there are actually four. According to the text, Nirvana's One Vehicle also has sameness, therefore saying 'like the Nirvana Sutra, explained as same and different.'"

Question: Someone says: "'Like the Nirvana Sutra, is it explained as same and different?' is question wording. The answer text is abbreviated." How is this interpretation?

Answer: From textual appearance, this could also be said, so there is no problem. However, above, contrasting Śrīmālā and Lotus, it said "Śrīmālā harmonizes causes and fruits, Lotus secretly harmonizes four," clarifying same and different. Next saying "like Nirvana, etc." means "Nirvana is also thus, in contrast to Lotus, having same and different aspects." Therefore it should be called wording within the previous answer. Why labor to call it question wording? Moreover, within this section there are seven layers of questions and answers, all having question and answer characters. Why, reaching this place, would there be no question character and no answer wording? Master Pearl's commentary explanation is most excellent.

Question: In Master Qingsu's commentary, citing "like the Ratnagotravibhāga text 'same or different?'" to explain it. This cites an alternative text. However, seeing its meaning, it makes it question wording. Why then say it's not question wording? Also, if there is such an alternative text, what text should one follow?

Answer: Even if an alternative text, saying "question" and "answer" has no problem. One should just follow one's intention to read easily and analyze it. Like the present text, taking it as wording within the answer is superior. However, regarding having two texts, one should follow the majority text as correct. Texts circulated in the world are mostly like the present text.

Question: The Mahāyānasaṃgraha commentary states: "Question: Leading and receiving one type to explain One Vehicle. If not leading them, is this ultimately really for going to their own vehicle's remainderless extinction, or not?" What does this mean?

[Left Page]

Answer: The question's meaning is: "Is One Vehicle explained to lead and gather one type of indefinite-nature śrāvakas? If not leading and gathering them, should they enter their own vehicle's remainderless nirvana, or not?"

Question: How then is this question answered?

Answer: The next answer states: "There are traditionally two interpretations. First: 'They definitely do not go to extinction. They will obtain turning of mind because they have Mahāyāna seed-nature that prevents this.' Second: 'If they do not encounter conditions, they also enter remainderless. Therefore the Tathāgata earnestly demonstrates, striving to make them turn their minds. Otherwise, why would the Great Master be so earnest?'"

Question: Which of these two interpretations is correct?

Answer: The next text states: "Discussion: The first interpretation is good. How is this verified? Answer: Though there are texts of encouragement, there is no text explaining entry into extinction without teaching. Also, like the eighth ground having reached immobility, the Tathāgata also encourages advancement and transcendence. Is this teaching because of fearing entry into extinction? This is not so. How could that be so? Therefore the Daśabhūmika Sutra states: 'When bodhisattvas dwell in this immobility ground, all mind-consciousness etc. do not function. Buddhas make such statements: You have obtained this ultimate patience conforming to all dharmas, but our ten powers, four fearlessnesses, etc., you have not yet obtained. You should diligently advance. Afflicted sentient beings you should compassionately remember,' etc. Also examining the Laṅkāvatāra Sutra, it states: 'All Buddha Bhagavats, to show the Tathāgata's inconceivable immeasurable merits.' The commentary states: 'Buddhas encourage eighth-ground bodhisattvas saying: The Tathāgata has inconceivable immeasurable merits. You have not yet obtained them. You should not dwell here. There is nothing to use as proof.' This immobility ground fears not ascending, yet still encourages. Lesser sages have not yet generated bodhicitta, saying

leading and gathering one type. Why explain not encouraging?" The text's meaning can be understood.

Question: Next it also asks: "Question: The Daśabhūmika Sutra states: 'If buddhas do not give this bodhisattva the arising of wisdom gates, the bodhisattva then immediately enters nirvana, abandoning benefiting all sentient beings.' According to this, just fearing entry into nirvana, buddhas then encourage. Since bodhisattvas are thus, therefore know: if Tathāgatas do not encourage two-vehicle practitioners, they definitely enter nirvana. This makes it clear." The text's meaning is obvious. How to answer?

Answer: The next text states: "Answer: That sutra does not speak of entering remainderless dependence. It cannot be used as proof. It refers to quiescent, non-discriminating dharma, naming it nirvana. Therefore that sutra states: 'You now appropriately obtain this dharma-illumination, namely the dharma-illumination of all dharmas' quiescence and non-discrimination.' Also: 'The dharma-realm is permanent. Buddhas, because of obtaining this dharma, are explained and named Buddha. Two-vehicle practitioners also obtain this non-discriminating dharma.' Therefore it also states: 'Though you obtain this quiescent liberation, etc., you should remember such afflictions.' According to these texts, it is not remainderless dependence. If not so, two-vehicle remainderless cannot arise. Within Mahāyāna, the time has not arrived. Therefore, taking what dharma further, name it nirvana? Therefore the previous explanation is good. Just explaining that quiescence-seekers enter remainderless dependence is still difficult to understand completely. How much more indefinite-nature entering remainderless. Wise ones should consider this."

Question: What does this answer mean?

Answer: The meaning is: "The Daśabhūmika Sutra states: 'Eighth-ground bodhisattvas, if buddhas do not encourage them, enter nirvana abandoning beneficial sentient being activities, dwelling in signless quiescent principle, personally receiving quiescent bliss.' This is named dwelling in nirvana. Signless, non-discriminating quiescent principle resembles nirvana, therefore provisionally named nirvana. It does not mean actual remainderless nirvana. If not so, these bodhisattvas could no longer be

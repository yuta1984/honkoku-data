Depending on the Buddha attachment," explaining the One Vehicle according to the master's doctrine. "Thirty-four moments" refers to when cutting off the nine grades of delusions in the Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception realm, generating nine uninterrupted paths and nine liberation paths. This makes two times nine, eighteen moments. Adding the sixteen minds of the path of seeing makes thirty-four moments. Through these moments, the bodhi position is achieved. Who gives rise to this attachment? Like the Sarvāstivādins who cling to the Buddha's transformation body as his true body. Now explaining it as transformation breaks the three attachments. This is the distorted view of Sarvāstivādins and other Lesser Vehicle schools at the end of two hundred years after the Buddha's extinction. How could the Buddha explain the One Vehicle due to such attachments during his lifetime?

In the "Breaking the Separate" section of the One Vehicle Chapter, there are these "certain people's" doctrines and refutations. However, while the texts and meanings are quite different, the general intent is the same. By comparison, all can be understood.

Question: Dharma Master Ji says: "If so, was there no attachment to the Buddha under the tree as real during the Buddha's lifetime? If there was, what fault is there in breaking this by saying 'there are no three'?" How is this objection answered?

Answer: According to our doctrine: "This breaks the attachments of śrāvakas, not separate returning practices. Because there is no arising of great practices based on the Buddha Vehicle explained in the initial teachings." Examining this doctrine now, it is still unclear. It should be explained like the One Vehicle Chapter. That is, it says there: "Also, clinging to that transformation body as ultimate, seeking to reach it without further seeking other bodies. Now breaking that attachment makes them seek the one body. Therefore, it only breaks clinging to the two vehicles as ultimate, not breaking the attachment to those two bodies as ultimate."

Question: The Buddha often predicted future events. In the Avataṃsaka Sutra, fearing that future Sautrāntika masters would cling to formless minds as non-mind, he explained "three realms are mind-only." Also in the Mañjuśrī-paripṛcchā Sutra it says: "Seven schools will emerge as divisions from the Mahāsāṅghika school... I explain what will arise in the future," etc. Therefore ancient masters said "The One Vehicle is explained to break future Sarvāstivādin attachment to the Buddha's transformation

body as real," which has no difficulty. Why then does the chapter master refute this, saying "This is the distorted view of Lesser Vehicle after the Buddha's extinction"?

Answer: In sutras and treatises, there are clear authentic texts with no difficulty. Explaining the words "three realms are mind-only" is what Bodhisattva Asvabhāva explained in the Mahāyānasaṃgraha. The text of the Mañjuśrī-paripṛcchā Sutra is what the Buddha himself said. All are without doubt. But saying "The One Vehicle is explained to break future Sarvāstivādin attachments" - what canonical basis does this come from? There is no such matter in the Lotus and other sutras. Among the ten causes in the Mahāyānasaṃgraha and others, there is also no such cause. Why rely on personal opinion to indulge in such explanations? This doesn't mean not breaking future distorted views.

The chapter states: Question: Why establish One Vehicle and Five Vehicles without explaining one piṭaka and five piṭakas, explaining six piṭakas without explaining six vehicles? The two piṭakas and three piṭakas explained in the Ajātaśatru-kaukṛtya-vinodana Sutra and others are the same as two vehicles and three vehicles.

Answer: "Vehicle" has the meaning of transportation, clarifying vehicles in terms of faculties and practices. "Piṭaka" has the meaning of containment; teachings become piṭakas in relation to principles. The reason why "one and five" differs from "six types" is that the two-three piṭakas and two-three vehicles explained in sutras manifest transportation through faculties and practices, distinguishing teachings in relation to faculties and principles. There is reason for them to be the same. One cannot immediately make them all the same or all different. Following what is appropriate, vehicles and piṭakas are provisionally distinguished. Having these different-same relative aspects, generally having same characteristics does not go against principle. However, no text is seen. Also, according to the Bodhisattva-piṭaka, the second volume explains: "The ten perfections and ten corruptions have equal numbers in mutual treatment, but the four wheels and eight difficulties have different numbers in mutual treatment. They should not be equally criticized."

This question and answer generally distinguishes the difficulties regarding various vehicles and is not essential to One Vehicle doctrine. Therefore it is not recorded in detail.

The chapter states: Question: Vehicle has the meaning of conveyance

and crossing. Bodhisattvas can have vehicles. Since Tathāgatas have already crossed over, Buddha Vehicle should not be established.

Answer: Both self and others can ride. Bodhisattvas possess both crossings. Crossing others is not self-crossing. What prevents establishing Buddha Vehicle?

This answer is the first among five meanings in the One Vehicle Chapter. That chapter does not use this answer, taking as correct the doctrine that even the fruit stage has two conveyances called "vehicle." As recorded in detail in the "Explaining Names" section above, this can be understood.

The chapter states: Question: Why do some places explain Buddha Vehicle, also called Bodhisattva Vehicle, only called Śrāvaka Vehicle, not called Pratyekabuddha Vehicle?

Answer: Relative to fruits, only Buddha Vehicle is explained. Since two conveyances can be cultivated, Bodhisattva Vehicle is explained. Because practices are extensive, it is called Mahāyāna. To exclude the other two, it is also called One Vehicle. Pratyekabuddhas have no separate teaching gate. Initial practices also arise through sound, therefore called Śrāvaka Vehicle, not called Pratyekabuddha Vehicle. The two vehicles generally are all called Lesser Vehicle. Because faculties, practices, etc., are equally narrow and inferior, there is no contradiction.

This question and answer also generally explains difficulties regarding various vehicles, not only One Vehicle. Therefore no further discussion is determined. Students should understand this completely.

The chapter states: Question: Since fruits are contrasted to name it Buddha Vehicle, fruits should also be contrasted to name it Buddha-piṭaka. Why only call it Bodhisattva-piṭaka and not name it Buddha-śrāvaka? Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas both obtain piṭaka names. As will be extensively explained in the Piṭaka Chapter.

This question and answer is also not what is clarified here. Moreover, its answer text defers to the Various Piṭakas Chapter and is not stated here. Therefore it is not further recorded. Students should investigate this.

Question: The chapter states: Question: Are teaching, principle, practice, and fruit all the essence of One Vehicle - are they the same or different? What does this question mean?

Answer: Good Pearl states: The question means: "Making teaching, principle, practice, and fruit the essence of One Vehicle - in comparison with various vehicles, are they the same or different?"

[Lower Section]

Question: How then is this question answered? Answer: The chapter immediately states:

Answer: One rain universally moistens - teachings are the same but faculties differ. Three animals cross the river - principles are the same but realizations differ. Six places great causes - practices are the same but cultivation differs. Three carts entice and lead - fruits are the same but applications differ. Sometimes different, sometimes the same - no need to labor over fixed standards. Śrīmālā harmonizes causes and harmonizes fruits. The Lotus harmonizes teaching, practice, and fruit - the three. One rain is teaching. Nine divisions are practice. Three carts are fruit. Manifestly showing only teaching, practice, and fruit, secretly there are actually four. Like the Nirvana Sutra, explained as same and different.

Question: What does this answer mean? Answer: This answer has two meanings. First, it contrasts One Vehicle with other vehicles to show same and different. Later it clarifies that among various sutras explaining One Vehicle, there are distinctions in harmonizing the four dharmas. "One rain universally moistens" up to "applications differ" is the first meaning. As extensively explained in the "Harmonizing the Separate" section above, it can be understood like that. From "Śrīmālā harmonizes causes" below is the second meaning.

Question: What does "Śrīmālā harmonizes causes and harmonizes fruits" mean? Answer: Qingsu states: "Śrīmālā making the six place-causes into Mahāyāna is harmonizing causes. The four cognitions not being ultimate is harmonizing fruits."

Question: Regarding "The Lotus harmonizes teaching, practice, and fruit," why does the One Vehicle Chapter state: "However, in the Lotus, manifestly it harmonizes teaching and principle, secretly it harmonizes practice and fruit"?

Answer: Cien's explanations of the Lotus's teaching, principle, practice, and fruit have many interpretations in various places. However, the ultimate takes comprehending teaching, principle, practice, and fruit as correct. Among the five meanings explaining the lotus in contrast to the Infinite Meanings, the third states: "The Infinite Meanings Sutra takes teaching and principle as the lotus; this sutra takes practice and fruit as the lotus." This is one explanation. However, properly taking the four dharmas as metaphor for the lotus is superior. Also, what is questioned in the One Vehicle Chapter states: "Therefore this One Vehicle, based on reality, comprehends teaching, principle, practice, and fruit." This chapter also

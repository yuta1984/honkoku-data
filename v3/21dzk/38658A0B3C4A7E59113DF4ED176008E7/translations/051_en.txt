Therefore. Question: The chapter states: "These differences, as well as what is clarified in the fifth question-and-answer section, etc., are all as in separate chapters and are not enumerated due to their complexity." What does this mean? Answer: This clarifies the differences between the One Vehicle of the Immeasurable Meanings Sutra and this sutra, and explains why, among the five gates used to clarify the One Vehicle in this chapter, the fifth question-and-answer discrimination gate is referred to elsewhere and not fully presented. That is, explaining the differences between the One Vehicles of the two sutras, as stated above, points to the section on explaining names in the second volume of the commentary above that explains the Immeasurable Meanings. Referring to that place, this text does not present the fifth gate. It points to the fifth question-and-answer discrimination gate among the five gates in the various vehicles chapter. Referring to that place, this text does not present it fully. Question: Regarding the differences between the One Vehicles of the two sutras, since it already says "as extensively explained in the section on explaining names," why does it also say "these differences are as in separate chapters"? Does it also point to elsewhere? Answer: Not so. Above clarifies the place where differences are explained, therefore it says "as in the section on explaining names." Below clarifies the reason for abbreviation and not fully presenting, therefore it says "as in separate chapters." It does not mean they exist elsewhere.

Question: What is the meaning of the fifth question-and-answer discrimination gate? Answer: This gate's meaning is to resolve objections that exist in the One Vehicle explained above. That is, in the various vehicles chapter, there are seven layers of questions and answers. They generally resolve all objections regarding the various vehicles. Among these, the questions and answers regarding the One Vehicle constitute the meaning of this gate. Question: The vehicles chapter states: "In this, according to the principle of the One Vehicle, there should appropriately be only one without the other two or three. The Lotus Sutra says: 'Whether śrāvakas or bodhisattvas, hearing the dharma I have explained, even regarding a single verse, all will undoubtedly become Buddhas.' The Nirvana [Sutra] also says: 'All who have minds will certainly attain unsurpassed bodhi.' Why then do you say 'it is to attract the indeterminate'? Even the five vehicles—all sentient beings have Buddha-nature and will ultimately all reach the ultimate fruit of Mahāyāna. Why are there ultimately human and heavenly vehicles that do not return to Buddhahood?"

[Lower Section]

Answer: Although the various gates above have finished explaining that despite teaching the One Vehicle, there exists the principle of three, four, and five vehicles, this objection suggests there should only be the One Vehicle without other vehicles. Within the objection are two meanings. First: The Lotus says "śrāvakas and bodhisattvas who hear the dharma all become Buddhas," and the Nirvana also says "all who have minds attain bodhi." Therefore there should only be the One Vehicle, with no one remaining at the ultimate fruits of śrāvakahood or pratyekabuddhahood. Yet why do you say "teaching only the One Vehicle is to attract and include one class of indeterminate-nature people, but in reality there are differences among the five vehicles"? Second: All sentient beings have Buddha-nature and will eventually become Buddhas. Yet why establish the principle of five vehicles, saying "there is one class that remains in human and heavenly vehicles and never becomes Buddha"? The first objects that there should be no fixed-nature two-vehicle practitioners; the second objects that there should be no natureless sentient beings. Question: How then is this objection resolved?

Answer: The chapter states: "Answer: The Mahāyāna-saṃgraha treatise [gives] ten reasons why the Buddha teaches the One Vehicle. The Xiāngyáng [treatise gives] six reasons why the Buddha teaches the One Vehicle, as previously clarified. The meaning of the present explanation is: speaking according to reality, the five vehicles are each different, as established by the teachings and principles previously cited. The One Vehicle is taught to attract one class; it is not that vehicles are only one without two, three, etc. The Lotus treatise says: 'There are four [types of] śrāvakas: first, those who tend toward quiescence; second, those who retreat from the bodhi mind, also called those who turn toward bodhi mind; third, manifestation-transformations; fourth, those with overweening pride.' The sutra is only for teaching and transforming those who retreat from bodhi mind and manifestation-transformations, therefore the World-Honored One confers predictions. Not the other two

types." Manifestation-transformation śrāvakas are what the sutra describes as "indulging in samādhi wine, not awakening for eons, later arising from that and then generating great mind." Buddhas, bodhisattvas, etc., create these transformation forms to transform śrāvaka types. Previous sages entered extinction; after eons of long time, they still generate [bodhi] mind—how much more so for us others. Therefore, for manifestation-transformations, the One Vehicle is taught and they receive predictions to become Buddhas. The ten reasons in the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha treatise—the ninth being transformation—this is exactly that. Śāriputra and others previously generated great mind, but due to giving away eyes, they retreated to seek small fruits. Now the One Vehicle is taught for me and they receive predictions. Therefore it also says the One Vehicle is taught for those who retreat from bodhi mind, etc. Otherwise it would contradict the Laṅkāvatāra's Sublime five types of nature. Also, the Nirvana says: "At one time I taught one vehicle, one path, one practice, one condition, explaining that stream-enterers through arhats all attain the Buddha path. My various disciples did not understand my meaning and proclaimed such words in the great assembly: 'The Tathāgata teaches that stream-enterers through arhats all attain the Buddha path.' If all become Buddhas, then they understand the Buddha's meaning. Why are they called not understanding the Buddha's meaning?" Therefore know that it should only be as explained herein.

Question: What is the meaning of this answer? Answer: The meaning of this answer is to generally clarify that although the One Vehicle is taught, there exists the principle of five vehicles.

Question: If you say there are recipients for five vehicles, why does the Xuanzan state: "According to the Nirvana Sutra, there is only one type of recipient. Therefore that sutra says: 'Lion's roar means the definitive meaning, explaining that all sentient beings have Buddha-nature.' Even this sutra says: 'In Buddha-lands of the ten directions, there is only One Vehicle dharma'... only teaching and transforming bodhisattvas, without śrāvaka disciples... according to this, there is only one Great Vehicle nature. This

[Lower Section]

sutra already teaches the One Vehicle, causing it to reach that Great Vehicle root-nature." Also, the Pivotal Essentials states: "Those who rely on the Lotus: using teaching to assess recipients, there is only one recipient." Answer: All of these can be resolved through the meaning of the previous answer. Also, the Buddha-Land Treatise generally explains: "Although other sutras proclaim that all types of sentient beings have Buddha-nature and will all become Buddhas, this is said regarding True Suchness Dharma-body Buddha-nature and also regarding a portion of all sentient beings, expediently spoken to cause indeterminate seed-nature sentient beings to definitely and quickly realize unsurpassed perfect bodhi." Also, the fourth gate of the Separate Commentary states: "Harmonizing teachings: The Lotus Sutra says 'In worlds of the ten directions, there is only One Vehicle dharma.' If there are fixed natures of three vehicles, how is this harmonized? Explanation: This makes this statement in response to indeterminate seed-natures. Also, the Non-increase-decrease Sutra says 'the realm of sentient beings neither increases nor decreases, neither arises nor ceases'—knowing there are none who ultimately enter nirvana. If there were fixed natures entering remainderless dependence, that sutra should say 'the realm of sentient beings decreases.' Explanation: That sutra speaks regarding the essential nature of the sentient beings' realm. The principle of True Suchness has no increase or decrease. Another explanation: It says 'the realm of sentient beings does not increase or decrease' but does not say 'sentient beings do not increase or decrease.' The word 'realm' generally refers to the limits of the sentient beings' realm, not speaking regarding sentient beings. Therefore there is no contradiction." If there are natureless ones, the Nirvana asks: "How can it be said that those with minds become Buddhas?" Explanation: This is said regarding a portion. Another explanation: This is said regarding having Great Vehicle undefiled [seeds] and indeterminate-nature undefiled mind-seeds. It does not say all those with minds can become Buddhas. The sutra's meaning is esoteric, therefore there is no contradiction. Through these and other texts, all can be harmonized and resolved. Question: The chapter states: "Question: The sutra itself

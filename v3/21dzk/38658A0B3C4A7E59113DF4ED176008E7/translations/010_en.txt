has the fourth non-abiding nirvāṇa. The Buddha-fruition stage has four types of nirvāṇa, therefore it differs from the cause.

Question: What is the meaning of the fifth "essence of transcending the fragmentary"?

Answer: Taking the principle and wisdom that exists in cause and effect after separating from fragmentary birth and death, making this the One Vehicle essence. This is the essence meaning. Therefore the treatise states: "Comprehensively taking the principle and wisdom possessed by cause and effect in transcending fragmentary death, making this the One Vehicle."

Question: In the causal stage there is the meaning of transcending the fragmentary. Namely, wisdom-predominant bodhisattvas abandon the fragmentary at the first stage, compassion-predominant bodhisattvas transcend the fragmentary at the eighth stage, and bodhisattvas of equal wisdom and compassion abandon the fragmentary in each of the stages up to the seventh stage according to their inclination. Therefore it is called "transcending the fragmentary." In the Buddha-fruition stage there is no meaning of transcending the fragmentary, so why say "comprehensively taking cause and effect transcending fragmentary death" etc.?

Answer: The Water Commentary states: "If speaking according to the fruition stage, this is directly transcending the transformational. Now taking the principle and wisdom of the two positions within the cause (the positions of gradual awakening and sudden awakening, or the positions of wisdom-predominant and compassion-predominant), broadly establishing the name from the general, calling it transcending the fragmentary. In the fruition this does not contradict the meaning of transcending the fragmentary."

Question: If so, why not establish an "essence of transcending the transformational"?

Answer: Because it is narrow, it is not established. It exists within the previous essence. This can be known through investigation.

Question: The treatise states: "Among the four meanings of opening, showing, awakening, and entering, the first three are for fruition, the latter one is for cause. As already explained before, therefore it is briefly not discussed." What does this mean?

Answer: This cites evidence. Having three is the first.

Question: How does this text prove this essence?

Answer: Now speaking of the One Vehicle, it takes the four types of knowledge and vision of opening, showing, awakening, and entering as essence. "Opening" manifests fruition principle and wisdom, "showing" manifests fruition principle, "awakening" manifests fruition wisdom, "entering" manifests causal principle and wisdom. Therefore this text is cited as evidence for taking causal and fruition principle and wisdom as the One Vehicle essence.

Question: What is the general meaning of the four meanings of opening, showing, awakening, and entering?

Answer: The sūtra states: "What is meant by saying that all Buddha-bhagavats appear in the world only for the sake of the one great matter? All Buddha-bhagavats appear in the world because they wish to cause sentient beings to open Buddha's knowledge and vision and attain purity. They appear in the world because they wish to show sentient beings Buddha's knowledge and vision. They appear in the world because they wish to cause sentient beings to awaken to Buddha's knowledge and vision. They appear in the world because they wish to cause sentient beings to enter the path of Buddha's knowledge and vision."

In explaining this text, in the treatise there is one explanation of "opening," two explanations of "showing," and three explanations of "awakening and entering." In the Profound Commentary there are three explanations in total.

First, regarding the treatise explanations, the treatise states: "First, the meaning of supremacy. Except for the Tathāgata's all-knowledge, there is nothing else. Second, the meaning of sameness. Because the dharma-bodies of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and Buddha are equal. Third, the meaning of unknowability. Because all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do not know that true reality. Fourth, in order to cause realization of the non-regression stage, showing the manifestation of wanting to give the karma of immeasurable wisdom."

Next it states: "Moreover, 'showing' means for those bodhisattvas who have doubts, causing them to know true cultivation." "Moreover, 'awakening and entering' means: for those who have not yet generated the bodhi-mind, causing them to generate the mind; for those who have already generated the mind, causing them to enter the dharma." "Moreover, 'awakening' means causing heretical sentient beings to generate awakening. Moreover, 'entering' means causing those who attain śrāvaka fruition to enter great bodhi."

The above are the second explanation of "showing" and the second and third explanations of "awakening and entering." The meaning can be understood in detail.

Regarding the three explanations in the Profound Commentary, the first states: "'Opening' is the meaning of productive manifestation and realization. Producing bodhi and manifesting realization of nirvāṇa. Therefore, except for these two types, there is nothing else. Because it surpasses the two dharmas, it is called supreme. 'Showing' is the meaning of sameness. Because the dharma-bodies of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and Buddha in the three vehicles are equal. Dharma-body equality means there is no difference in Buddha-nature dharma-body. The Nirvāṇa Sūtra states: 'It is like milk cows having various colors, but when their milk is extracted and placed in one location, the white color has no difference. Buddha-nature is also thus. Although sentient beings have various differences, Buddha-nature has no distinction.' 'Awakening' is the meaning of not-knowing. Because all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do not know that true reality. Not knowing the true reality means not knowing that ultimately there is only one Buddha Vehicle. Therefore, like below where a person goes to a friend's house, becomes drunk and lies down, and a priceless jewel is sewn into his clothing, etc. - initially he is unaware, but later awakens and then knows.

Regarding the above three types: 'Opening' jointly manifests dharma-body and reward-body, nirvāṇa and bodhi, the two types of supremacy, praising their excellence to cause joy. 'Showing' separately manifests that reward-body bodhi of the three vehicles is non-dual and originally existent, causing their cultivation and realization to be awakened. 'Awakening' separately manifests reward-body bodhi as foremost and ultimate, with original-existence seeds, causing cultivation of fruition to arise.

'Entering' means in order to cause realization of the non-regression stage, manifesting giving the karma of immeasurable wisdom. Although the above three comprehensively and separately manifest the Buddha-fruition's supreme equal excellence, it is not yet known how realization and attainment are possible. Now manifesting the cause of ability to realize and ability to attain, therefore it is called entering. According to this fundamental treatise, first stage and above are called non-regression stages. In Buddha-fruition, all-knowledge has great essence and function, therefore it is called immeasurable wisdom. Karma means cause.

The meaning of these four is that Buddha's appearing in the world is because he wishes to cause sentient beings to exhaust the two obstructions, open Buddha's bodhi and nirvāṇa knowledge and vision, attain purity, praise the two supremacies, and encourage joy. Showing that dharma-body is commonly possessed, causing reali-

zation. Causing awakening to the previously unknown sole Buddha Vehicle wisdom, causing cultivation and arising. Having already manifested the excellent essential nature of Buddha-fruition bodhi and nirvāṇa, and also manifesting its cause, causing entry into it. That is, Buddha's intention in appearing in the world is to explain the One Vehicle's fruition and cause, causing all sentient beings to cultivate the cause, realize the fruition, and all become Buddhas, not for anything else. Previously praising wisdom and the wisdom gate is precisely the One Vehicle teaching and its principle. Now explaining practice and fruition. Therefore it is known that comprehensively explaining the four dharmas of the One Vehicle is called Lotus.

...Up to the second explanation states: "Now these four meanings comprehensively depend on Buddha-nature dharma-body wisdom-essence as the One Vehicle. The Nirvāṇa Sūtra states: 'The great matter refers to Buddha-nature. Moreover, there are ultimately two: first, the ultimate of adornment (six pāramitās); second, the ultimate of completion. The One Vehicle attained by all sentient beings. The One Vehicle is Buddha-nature. Because of this meaning, I explain that all sentient beings completely possess Buddha-nature, completely possess the One Vehicle. Because they are covered by ignorance, they cannot see it.' Therefore it is known that Buddha-nature is precisely knowledge and vision, precisely the One Vehicle. Explaining that all sentient beings completely possess Buddha-nature is called 'opening.' Detailed proclamation and discrimination is called 'showing.' This is dharma Buddha-nature, this is reward Buddha-nature, this is causal nature, this is conditional nature, this is principle nature, this is practice nature, this is good-root person nature, this is non-good-root person nature - these are called 'showing.'

Various discriminations causing understanding to arise are called 'awakening.' Encouraging beings to undertake cultivation, causing entry into realization, is called 'entering.'

...Up to the third explanation states: "Those first three types are explained by depending on the three matters of Buddha-fruition great parinirvāṇa. ...Up to mahā-prajñā is precisely opening Buddha's knowledge and vision. Therefore the treatise explains: 'Except for all-knowledge, there is nothing else.'"

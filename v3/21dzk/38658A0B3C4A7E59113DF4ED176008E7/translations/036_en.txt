they wish to regress and abide in the two vehicles. Therefore clearly unifying two-vehicle practices is to enable their entry into Mahāyāna. It teaches that two-vehicle practices are the provisional causes of Mahāyāna, and that the principle-fruit and wisdom-fruit of the two vehicles are causes of Mahāyāna nirvana. To support lesser bodhisattvas without generating regression, it is essential to manifestly unify practice and fruit in order to enable both sudden-awakening and gradual-awakening types of lesser bodhisattvas to cultivate bodhisattva practices. Therefore practice is clearly taught." It also states: "Question: What is called secretly teaching and unifying teaching and principle? Answer: What is not clearly taught in the sūtra is called secret. Among the six places, the first four are teaching. The latter two are practice. Teaching is where practice arises, and can also be called practice. Therefore including teaching, it brings them together and comprehensively unifies them into One Vehicle practice. This clearly unifies teaching. Also when unifying two-vehicle fruit, principle-fruit and wisdom-fruit are brought together mutually and comprehensively entered into Mahāyāna fruit for unification. It clearly teaches fruit but does not clearly teach principle. It only manifestly unifies fruit, while principle follows fruit and has already been secretly unified. When principle is opposed to signifying teaching it is called principle; when this principle is opposed to cause it is called fruit. Therefore teaching and principle have been secretly unified." It also states: "Question: Speaking of 'unification' means enabling awakened entry, making them equally return to One Vehicle - this should be called harmonious unification. Since it already states the two vehicles do not know, why unify? Answer: Previously they did not know the intent of teaching. Now because it is taught for them, it is called unification. If those two vehicles had previously known by themselves, they would not cling to the three as separate. Why would unification be needed? Precisely because they do not know, there is unification." The Compendium Commentary states: "Question: Śrīmālā One Vehicle takes principle as nature. It should manifestly unify the correctly taught principle and teaching. Why is it not so? Answer: In response to the two vehicles clinging to provisional practice and fruit, therefore the cause-fruit One Vehicle is taught. It does not immediately take that as the One Vehicle essence. It clearly states that their attainment is not for the ultimate but should be for great gradual progress. Therefore it is called manifestly unifying practice and fruit while secretly unifying teaching and principle. This can be understood accordingly. Or immediately cause-fruit is called principle. Both principle-nature and what is signified are called principle. Therefore regarding the Lotus's manifest and secret, if this is examined it should all be understood. Therefore it is not elaborately stated."

Question: Regarding the Lotus's intent, how is manifest and secret clarified?

Answer: Regarding the Lotus's intent, it correctly manifests opening former provisional and showing present real, therefore it is said to manifestly unify teaching and principle. Additionally, to enable those who awaken to teaching and principle to cultivate One Vehicle practice and realize One Vehicle fruit, it is said to secretly unify practice and fruit.

Question: In explaining the sūtra title, practice and fruit are correctly called lotus, so why now speak of secretly unifying practice and fruit?

Answer: The Water Commentary states: "In the place of four namings, saying practice-fruit is correct lotus refers to Mahāyāna practice-fruit. Now in this place of unifying distinctions, saying practice-fruit is secret teaching refers to Hīnayāna practice-fruit." The meaning is: In the naming, regarding One Vehicle practice-fruit, it correctly clarifies lotus; in the place of unifying distinctions, because it unifies two-vehicle practice-fruit, it is called secret unification. Therefore there is no contradiction.

Question: The treatise states: "Therefore this One Vehicle, based on reality, comprehensively unifies teaching, principle, practice and fruit." What does this mean?

Answer: This is concluding text. The meaning is: Based on the various texts as above, explaining One Vehicle doctrine is based on reality and all comprehensively unify distinct teaching, principle, practice and fruit, therefore it is called One Vehicle.

Question: The treatise states: "Generally explaining the various texts, in principle it is indeed fitting. Therefore it is said that unifying distinctions is called One." What does this mean?

Answer: This is also a repeated conclusion. Above it concluded the doctrine of unifying distinctions based on various texts, explaining the reason for encompassing teaching, principle, practice and fruit. It can be understood as the text indicates.

Question: The treatise states: "This sūtra correctly takes One Vehicle cause and fruit as the true vehicle essence, with teaching as expedient means. Therefore there is no contradiction." What does this mean?

Answer: Above it generally

explained various texts and concluded the doctrine of unifying distinctions. Now specifically regarding this sūtra, it concludes the doctrine of unifying distinctions. The meaning is: this sūtra correctly takes the cause-fruit principle-wisdom of opening, showing, awakening and entering as the One Vehicle real essence. Therefore it correctly unifies distinct principle, practice and fruit, making them return to One Vehicle principle, practice and fruit, called unifying distinctions. Therefore it is called One. Wisdom-gate teaching is called expedient means. Although not the true vehicle essence, it also opens distinct provisional teaching to manifest One Vehicle teaching, called unifying distinctions. Therefore it is called One. The Water Commentary states: "This explanation is the same as calling signifying teaching provisional expedient means and signified wisdom true reality. In true reality, it wishes to enable the two vehicles to practice causes and attain fruit." The Compendium Commentary states: "Although teaching is not the correct One Vehicle essence, One Vehicle expedient means is also called One Vehicle. Taking this involves no error." The meanings are all the same.

Question: Why does the treatise text speak of cause-fruit as true vehicle and teaching as expedient means without mentioning principle?

Answer: The Compendium Commentary answers: "Speaking of cause-fruit already encompasses principle. Within cause-fruit there is definitely principle. Therefore it does not await statement." The Water Commentary states: "Cause-fruit opposed to teaching is precisely principle-dharma."

Question: What does the treatise mean by "therefore there is no contradiction"?

Answer: The Water Commentary states: "The meaning is that it does not contradict the principle of manifestly unifying teaching and principle while secretly unifying practice and fruit." The meaning can be understood.

Question: The treatise states: "Now this small doctrine, though not yet stirring the ocean of wisdom, as known by this fool, is also quite unprecedented in past and present. Those with broad learning and deep wisdom should examine it themselves." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the treatise author's modest words. "Small doctrine" refers to the above three doctrines of distinguishing, refuting, and unifying distinctions. "Ocean of wisdom" means Buddha. "Past and present" refers to Tiantai, Sanlun, etc.

Question: The treatise states: "Among the three doctrines, the first two explanations apply to both determined-nature and undetermined-nature, while the latter mostly depends only on undetermined-nature." What does this mean?

Answer: Above it used three doctrines to explain One Vehicle. Now it clarifies those people who are distinguished, refuted, and unified. The meaning is: the doctrines of distinguishing and refuting distinctions clarify teaching One Vehicle to distinguish away and obstruct-refute determined-nature and undetermined-nature people each clinging to their own vehicle as ultimate. The doctrine of unifying distinctions only clarifies teaching One Vehicle to harmonize undetermined-nature clinging to their own vehicle as distinct.

Question: What use is there in teaching One Vehicle to distinguish and refute the clinging of determined-nature people?

Answer: To enable them to gain the benefit of believing and knowing Mahāyāna without being foolish about dharma. This indicates subsidiary benefit. It should be understood as usual.

Question: The Compendium Commentary states: "Question: That distinguishing applies to both is certainly not mistaken, because there is no distinct principle. How can refuting distinctions apply to determined-nature? The fruit of determined-nature looks to its own ultimate." How does it answer?

Answer: There are briefly two explanations.

Question: What are they?

Answer: The text states: "First, the one of refuting distinctions only applies to undetermined-nature. Undetermined-nature people will definitely attain great fruit. Now regarding small fruit, they mistakenly cling to it as ultimate and refuse to advance. They should be refuted to enable ascent. What the determined-nature attains they take as ultimate. Now also refuting this, where would it lead them? Therefore refuting distinctions only applies to the undetermined. Second, it also applies to determined-nature. What is most honored and supremely excellent, with nothing able to surpass it, can be called one ultimate. The principle attained by determined-nature is not so. What could be called one ultimate? It is not that they cannot obtain others' excellent dharmas, but immediately take what is already attained as one ultimate. Therefore the latter explanation is superior." Using the doctrine of unifying distinctions in relation to undetermined-nature is easy to understand.

Question: The treatise states: "Mahāyāna Supreme, though identical with One Vehicle, is not required by the sūtra, therefore briefly not explained." What does this mean?

Answer: In the initial essence-determination section, it states that One Vehicle is also called Mahāyāna Supreme Vehicle, immediately called

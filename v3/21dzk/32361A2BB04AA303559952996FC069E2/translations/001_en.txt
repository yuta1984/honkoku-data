《Title: Kanshin Kakumu-shō》 Volume 1

If one wishes to attain bodhi, one must know one's own mind. This knowledge truly lies in the Vijñānavāda teaching. What person seeking the Dharma would not study this? However, the textual meanings are extensive and broad, making it impossible to learn all at once. Now, taking the most essential from the essential, I shall briefly indicate its purport. First: the foundational sūtras relied upon. Second: the teaching periods of the Buddha's lifetime. Third: the hundred dharmas and two emptinesses. Fourth: the establishment of the four divisions. Fifth: the meaning of three types of objects. Sixth: seed-perfuming. Seventh: the twelve-link dependent origination. Eighth: the three natures. Ninth: the three non-natures. Tenth: the mutual dependence of the two truths. Eleventh: the twofold middle way. Twelfth: the principles of consciousness-only. Thirteenth: inclusion within momentariness.

The Foundational Sūtras (the eleven treatises are temporarily omitted)
According to the Vijñānavāda Commentary, six sūtras are cited: namely, the Avataṃsaka, Saṃdhinirmocana, Tathāgatotpattisambhava-nirdeśa, Abhidharma, Laṅkāvatāra, and Ghanavyūha. Therefore, these six sūtras serve as the foundational scriptures.
However, among these six sūtras, the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra is particularly regarded as fundamental. It correctly elucidates consciousness-only, the three natures, ten stages, and causal positions and practices, being a complete-characteristics Mahāyāna middle way teaching. Moreover, the Laṅkāvatāra, Abhidharma, and Ghanavyūha sūtras are all scriptures that have not yet been transmitted [to China/Japan]. The Vijñānavāda treatise frequently quotes their passages. Question: If so, what about the location, teaching master, and interlocutors of the Saṃdhinirmocana? Answer: The location is the Lotus Treasury World, the teaching master is Vairocana Buddha, the interlocutor reaches to the Dharma Cloud ultimate stage, and the doctrinal principle is the middle way of complete meaning. All are seen in the sūtra. Being lengthy, it is not included here.

The Teaching Periods of One Lifetime
The classifications of teachings by ancient masters differ. Some establish one period of teaching, others establish two periods, and still others establish up to five periods. All of these establishments lack scriptural support and cannot be relied upon. According to the Yideng, "Establishing one, two, four, or five periods of teaching lacks scriptural authority and cannot be relied upon." Our school's position, based on the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, establishes three periods of teaching. Therefore, examining the Chapter on the Absence of Intrinsic Nature, Bodhisattva Paramārthasamudgata raises the contradictions between sūtras teaching existence and emptiness and questions the Tathāgata. The World-Honored One responds by expounding the great meaning of the lifetime of teachings and reconciling these contradictions. The textual passage is lengthy. Taking the essential meaning: based on the three natures of imagination, dependence, and perfection, the three types of naturelessness—characteristic, arising, and ultimate—are respectively established. Characteristic-naturelessness means that imagined constructions have absolutely no substantial nature, like flowers in the sky, hence called characteristic-naturelessness. Arising-naturelessness means that other-dependent nature lacks natural arising, like magical illusions, hence called arising-naturelessness. Ultimate-naturelessness means that the selflessness of all phenomena is far removed from all characteristics, like space, hence called ultimate-naturelessness. Based on these three types of naturelessness, I teach that all phenomena lack intrinsic nature. Based on the meaning of characteristic-naturelessness-emptiness and ultimate-naturelessness as inherently unchanging and eternal, I also teach no-birth, no-cessation, original tranquility, and natural nirvana. Based on arising-naturelessness and other-dependent substance, I also teach various dharmas like the five aggregates and four noble truths. Therefore, the earlier and later teachings do not contradict each other. At that time, Bodhisattva Paramārthasamudgata gained deep understanding and established the three periods of teaching—existence, emptiness, and middle way—for all the lifetime teachings. At that time, the Tathāgata praised and confirmed this.

The first period of teaching refers to when the Tathāgata initially, at one time, in the Deer Park, for the śrāvakas, extensively...

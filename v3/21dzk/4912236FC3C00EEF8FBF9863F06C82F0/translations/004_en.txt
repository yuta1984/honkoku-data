Ten Excellent Verses of the Huayan School
The flowers of five teachings and ten schools bloom in the garden of great and small, nature and characteristics.
The moon of ten mysteries and six characteristics hangs in the sky of perfect interpenetration and supreme meaning.
Above the ocean of fruition-nature, the waves of revolving back and forth are stilled.
Within the mountain of causes and conditions, the forest of roots, stems, branches, and leaves flourishes.
The solar disc emits light - many hundreds of thousands of high mountains first receive illumination.
The surging moisture raises sound - several billions of great oceans again uniquely bathe therein.
Sitting at the bodhi tree while ascending to the six heavens - the intention of the distinct teaching immediately penetrates.
Wandering in the dharma realm while remaining in one place - the purport of universal dharma is thus clear.
The power of ocean-seal samādhi manifests myriad forms upon one thought.
The virtue of Tathāgata's nature-origination shows ten gates within one speck of dust.
Where is Huayan not wholly present as one's own essence, existing nearby?
What thing in the dharma realm, pointing to the finest dust, is not close?
Brilliantly and uniformly manifesting, placing bright mirrors on silver platforms.
Layer upon layer mutually reflecting, hanging jeweled pearls in Śakra's palace.
The Hall of Universal Bright Light fans the winds of ten leaders and ten gates.
The Palace of the Sovereign Heaven radiates the light of one mind and one consciousness.
On the peak of Wonderful Summit Mountain, the wind of mindfulness of Buddha samādhi is cool.
In the borderlands of Sea Gate Country, the moon of great ocean dhyāna is bright.
Opening Maitreya's tower to see the treasures of all-embracing universal extension.
Entering Samantabhadra's pores to experience the spring of ineffable kalpas.

Now, establishing teachings and founding schools - this is the beautiful fragrance of ancient sages. Accomplishing meaning and manifesting principle - this is the elegant tradition of former worthies. The dharma transmission of China promotes thirteen schools. Beyond the previous ten schools are added Nirvana school, Dilun, and Shelun. Later generations gradually abandoned them, and their propagation and exposition became incomplete. The dharma transmission of Japan originally had eight schools. Chan method and Pure Land merely communicate general intent. My school encountered Huayan, obtained precepts from Southern Vinaya, refined Bhāvaviveka's [teachings], adorned the Four-Part [Vinaya], polished and governed Pure teachings, and harmonized with the ten vows. Additionally engaging with different transmissions, eliminating partiality and bias. Above, I have comprehensively praised the ten schools in their totality, all forming connections. Exclusively expecting realization and understanding, meritorious works are not empty. The essential point is merely to accomplish the ten bodies.

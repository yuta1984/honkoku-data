master. Thus the vinaya masters of these seven great temples were appointed in succession according to their ordination seniority. Up to the present day, the 107th generation master, Great Virtue Zōshin of Kōfukuji Temple, maintains the Vinaya School and conducts ordination ceremonies. The succession of the school has continued unbroken through generations of abbots. The ordinations at Tōdaiji Temple's precept platform have been maintained in this manner for over five hundred years. Kanzeonji Temple in the western provinces also operates similarly, with successive observance and unbroken transmission. The ordination ceremonies at Yakushiji Temple in the eastern provinces have been discontinued since ancient times and are no longer practiced. Great Master Jianzhen's many disciples each propagated the precepts and vinaya, their lineages flourished, and later generations were extremely prosperous. Great Monk Administrator Hōshin resided at Tōdaiji Temple, lived at the Tang Meditation Compound, and maintained the precept platform. This was the original place established by Jianzhen, entrusted to Hōshin, who administered the Tang Meditation Compound and propagated the precepts and vinaya. Ezan of the same temple, Shōichi of Gangōji Temple, Gyōsan of Yamada Temple (dharma name: Jōdo Temple), and others were all disciples of Hōshin. Vinaya Master Situo was a direct disciple personally ordained by Master Jianzhen. Master Taku had disciples including Ninki, Zenshun, Chūe, and Jōgi. At the end of his life, the Master entrusted Tōshōdaiji Temple to three people: Hōsai, Gijō, and Nyohō. These three great masters shared the same aspiration and combined their efforts to promote that temple and propagate the vinaya dharma. Each had many successor disciples, and their academic achievements were extremely flourishing. Hōsai transmitted to Shinkyō and others, Master Kyō transmitted to Hō-Kaishō and others, Kaishō transmitted to Jukō, Master Kō transmitted to Zōon, Master On transmitted to Andan, Master Dan transmitted to Great Virtue Kikan and others. Also, Shiryū, Shōmyō, Tetsusei, Fuku and others were all disciples of Gijō. Lesser Monk Administrator Nyohō had extremely many lineage disciples. Hō was the second patriarch of Japanese precepts and vinaya. Hō ordained Posthumously Appointed Monk Administrator Hōan as the third patriarch. Master An was appointed as the fourth master of the precept platform in the fourteenth year of Enryaku, and in the sixth year of Tenchō, year Tsuchinoto-

tori, he compiled the "Record of Precepts and Vinaya" in three volumes by imperial edict. He passed away on the thirteenth day of the ninth month in the seventh year of Jōwa, year Kanoe-saru. Hōan transmitted to Dōjō as the fourth patriarch. Jō composed the "Private Record on the Meaning of the Five Sections" in one volume. He was later appointed to [position at] Hakusaki. Master Jō transmitted to Ninkai as the fifth patriarch. Ninkai transmitted to Shinkū as the sixth patriarch. In this successive manner, they maintained transmission and propagation. For Japanese precepts and vinaya, the Great Master transmitted to Hōshin as the second patriarch, who resided at the Tang Meditation Compound and propagated the precepts and vinaya. Disciples continued in succession, maintaining the tradition in order. At Tōshōdaiji Temple alone, the precepts and vinaya flourished. After receiving ordination, many monks from various temples resided at that temple, studying the vinaya collection intensively for one to five years. This gradually declined in later generations. During Hōan's lifetime, vinaya practices were strict and well-ordered. Thereafter, scholars continued without interruption according to their circumstances, and the succession continued even to the final age. Although it did not match the ancient ceremonies, the lineage never ceased. Among the dharma masters of various schools, the precept disciplines never disappeared. Chōzō, Dōyū, Chōrō, Gishō, Shinsai, Shinnen, Jikaku, Chishō, Chōi, Zōmyō, Kōshō, Heion, Gangyō, Shōhō—such wise masters were numerous. Internally they overflowed with the ocean of wisdom, externally they accorded with vinaya standards, their authority moved humans and devas, and they realized the truth of sages and worthies. Later masters cultivated virtuous precepts according to their abilities, but later generations gradually declined and both practice and study disappeared. The seven temples all established Vinaya Schools, but in later generations they gradually declined and could not maintain lectures and discussions. Over 170 years after Hōan's death, during the reign of the 67th Human Sovereign, Emperor Sanjō, vinaya practices gradually declined and were not practiced. After another hundred-plus years, during the reign of the 74th Human Sovereign, Emperor Toba, vinaya practices fell into complete disuse. At that time, among the scholarly worthies of Kōfukuji Temple was Great Virtue Jithan, who dwelt in seclusion at Nakagawa Hermitage and responded to the refined request of Great Virtue Kinsai of Kōfukuji Temple,

searching through the vinaya collection, intensively studying the precept school, composing ordination platform procedures, and reviving the vinaya dharma. In the revival of the precept dharma, Master Han had great merit. After another eighty-plus years, during the reign of the 83rd Human Sovereign, Emperor Tsuchimikado, there was the ordained person Jōkei. He was a brilliant talent and wise virtue of Kōfukuji Temple, and his studies under Master Jithan were especially excellent (Jithan transmitted to Zōshun, Zōshun transmitted to Kakuken, and Kakuken transmitted to Jōkei). His understanding exhausted the three clarities, his learning encompassed the three baskets, his virtue filled the universe, and his authority moved both the hidden and manifest realms. He fled from fame and concealed his traces, resided at Kasagi Temple, again propagated the precepts and vinaya, and extensively bestowed instruction and transformation. At that time, the two worthies Kainyū and Kakushin studied the profound meanings of both Mahayana and Hinayana precepts and vinaya according to circumstances. Great Virtue Kakushin had the aspiration for succession and revival, built Jōki-in as a place of learning, established vinaya offerings, and housed monks. Many students came, and lectures and propagation became extremely flourishing. In the second year of Katei, year Hinoe-saru, during the reign of the 86th Human Sovereign, Emperor Shijō, there were four wise masters: Enjō, Ugon, Kakujō, and Eizon. They deeply lamented that although they had learning and understanding, they lacked precept conduct. Following the explanations in sutras and treatises and according to the procedures for general reception, the four worthies with unified hearts prayed for auspicious signs, took self-vows to receive ordination, and cultivated precept conduct. In the second year of Katei, year Hinoe-saru, Enjō and Ugon took self-vowed full ordination on the second day of the ninth month, and Kakujō and Eizon took self-vowed full ordination on the fourth day of the same month. They secluded themselves in Tōdaiji Temple's Hokke Hall (called Kenjaku Hall), prayed for solemn auspicious signs, and took self-vowed ordination before the Rushana Buddha in the Great Buddha Hall. Thereafter, the four masters each followed their preferred situations. Great Virtue Enjō (room name Sonshō, later called Shōen) resided at Fukū-in, later moved to northern Kyoto, and lectured on the vinaya collection. Master Kakujō initially lived at □-in of Kōfukuji Temple for seven to eight years, then moved to Tōshōdaiji Temple for six years. Master Eizon resided at Saidaiji Temple, lecturing on vinaya and

conferring precepts, promoting both exoteric and esoteric schools. The year Hinoe-saru was the general reception method. Ten years later, in mid Kanyen 2, year Kinoto-mi, at Ehara Temple in Izumi Province, they first instituted the method of separate bodhisattva reception. Kakujō and Eizon each served as preceptors, conducting ordination for ten people and transmitting to their respective disciples. With both general and separate receptions, vow and practice were complete, following proper vinaya procedures, and reception and maintenance were perfectly fulfilled. Great Virtue Kainyū constantly lectured on the vinaya collection. Keison of Hōtō-in, Kakushō of Chisoku-in (Tōdaiji Temple), Rengaku of Minoda, Zenkan and Ren'i of Kaijūzan, Enjō, Ugon, and Kakujō of Kōfukuji Temple, and Zen'e and Genshun of Tōdaiji Temple all followed Kainyū in listening to vinaya and learning precepts. In the Southern Gate Vinaya School, Kainyū had great merit. Master Jōkei long ago first lectured on the ancient commentaries on the Mahābrahmā Sutra at the Shōwa Portrait Hall of Tōshōdaiji Temple. From that time forward, the head abbots of that temple have maintained annual lectures and discussions without interruption to this day. Kainyū first lectured on ancient commentaries and vinaya sections at Saidaiji Temple and Kairyūōji Temple. Kainyū lectured on ancient commentaries at Tōshōdaiji Temple (after Shindo). The three vinaya masters among the four self-vowed worthies all conferred precepts on people. Enjō lectured on vinaya and conferred precepts, and his disciples were also numerous. Great Virtue Eizon of Saidaiji Temple initially listened to Master Jō's lectures on vinaya excerpts (the first mentioned above). Later he personally examined the great texts, studied intensively and thoroughly, followed Great Virtue Kakujō in listening to treatises on manifest and non-manifest dharmas, and listened to ancient commentaries on the Brahmajāla Sutra from Kainyū. Kakuchō and Kainyū followed Master Jōkei in studying ancient commentaries and treatises on manifest and non-manifest dharmas. Kakujō followed Kainyū in listening to treatises on manifest and non-manifest dharmas and ancient commentaries. Shinkū of the wooden pagoda and Shōju of Shingon-in (Tōdaiji Temple) listened to ancient commentaries on the Brahmajāla Sutra following Kakujō at a private temple. Shōju followed Master Kan in listening to ancient commentaries, completing five full cycles. Master Kakujō of Tōshōdaiji Temple moved to reside at that

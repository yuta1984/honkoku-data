He passed away on the first day of the ninth month in the sixth year of Zhenghe under Emperor Huizong, year Bingshen (corresponding to the fourth year of Eikyū under Emperor Toba of Japan). He was sixty-nine years old. From the year of his death until now (corresponding to the fourth year of Kagen, year Bingwu in Great Japan) one hundred ninety-one years have already passed. Vinaya Master Yuanzhao composed the "Zichi Records" and others, his disciples flourished, his teachings spread ever more widely, became popular throughout the realm, and were called the "Zichi School." This ran parallel with the earlier Huizheng tradition, but from later generations until today, the Zichi tradition stands alone. The sixteenth patriarch was Vinaya Master Zhijiao of Kaiyuan Sutra Academy (some establish Daobiao as the sixteenth patriarch). He received teachings from Yuanzhao and thoroughly studied the vinaya sections. His fellow disciples included Vinaya Masters Shi□, Faxiu, Faming, Daoyan, Xishen, Jinggao, Xiya, Duiying, Shaobing, Ze'an, Yanwei, Huiren and others, all of whom received from Master Zhao and penetrated the three studies. The seventeenth patriarch was Vinaya Master Weiyi of the Eastern Hall, who studied vinaya under Zhijiao, also received from Daobiao, refined the vinaya, and thoroughly understood the three studies. The eighteenth patriarch was Vinaya Master Fazheng of Bamboo Creek, who served under Weiyi and intensively researched the precept school. The nineteenth patriarch was Vinaya Master Fajiu of Stone Drum, who received vinaya teachings from Fazheng and achieved refined mastery. His fellow disciple was Vinaya Master Liaohong of Ru'an, who was a person of extraordinary spiritual capacity at that time. He received vinaya teachings from Fazheng and thoroughly penetrated subtle mysteries. Japanese Dharma Master Shunfan crossed the sea and entered Song, studied under his school, intensively researched the vinaya collection, and after several years returned to Japan to propagate the teachings. Ru'an's disciple was Vinaya Master Shouyi, who intensively researched precepts and vinaya and greatly established doctrinal principles. The twentieth patriarch was Vinaya Master Miaolian of Shangweng, who followed Master Jiu in studying precepts and vinaya, mastered both concentration and wisdom, and held the dharma with great skill. He died at Jile Hermitage in the third year of Jingding under Emperor Lizong, the fourteenth ruler of Great Song, year Renxu (corresponding to the third year of Kōchō under the eighty-ninth sovereign of Japan). He was eighty-one years old. The twenty-first patriarch was

Vinaya Master Xingju of Stone Forest, who received the vinaya collection from Vinaya Master Miaolian, intensively researched doctrinal paths, and thoroughly penetrated doctrinal gates. During that era, vinaya dharma flourished greatly, disciples multiplied, and teachings spread in all directions. The four masters from Bamboo Creek onward all resided at Huxin Guangfu Vinaya Temple, maintaining the transmitted dharma and upholding the image teachings. Miaolian and Shouyi had different doctrinal positions and engaged in scholarly debates, with arguments going back and forth. Shouyi died early, while Miaolian propagated the dharma teachings for a long time. Recently there have been the two worthies Zhirui and Liaoran, both of the Huizheng school, who uphold and propagate vinaya dharma. There is Yin Weina of the Zichi school, whose doctrinal learning is subtle and profound, lecturing tirelessly. Japanese Master Shun sent dozens of questions to the Great Song court, and these three master craftsmen each answered his questions. Later Master Shouyi also answered his questions. The above has completely presented the lineage of vinaya dharma transmission from ancient China. Regarding the propagation of precepts and vinaya in the Japanese realm, the fundamental origins are indeed momentous. However, from the grassroots foundation, progressing from small to manifest: In the thirteenth year of the reign of Emperor Kinmei (Amakuni Oshinohirakuhirotei), the thirtieth sovereign of Great Japan ruling from Shikishima Kanasashi Palace, year Renshin, the Buddha's teachings were first transmitted to this country. One thousand and six years after the Tathagata's nirvana, in the tenth year of Yongping under Emperor Ming of Later Han, the Buddha-dharma from India was first transmitted to China. Three hundred years later, the Buddha-dharma from China was transmitted to Baekje. One hundred years after that, the Buddha-dharma from Baekje was first transmitted to the Japanese realm. This was what was transmitted in the year Renshin under Emperor Hirotei. The Buddha-dharma gradually spread, but the precept-dharma was not yet established. In the fifth year of Emperor Bidatsu's reign, year Bingshen, vinaya masters, meditation masters, mantra masters, bhikkhuni nuns and others came from Baekje carrying sutras and treatises. From then on, transmission gradually continued. Under Emperor Su-

shun's first year, year Wushen, monks from Baekje came. Soga no Sukune invited these monks and asked about the methods of receiving precepts. Although there were such events, the various conditions did not align, and proper ordination could not be performed. Our country originally had three nuns, all born in Japan and all initially taking monastic vows. The first was called Nun Zenshin (originally Matsuri), the second Nun Zenzo (originally Toyamatsuri), and the third Nun Ezen (originally Ishimatsuri). These three nuns had the aspiration to receive precepts and wished to go to Baekje. For this reason they immediately inquired about the precept procedures. The monks replied that since there was no dual sangha, nun ordination could not be performed. The three nuns immediately went to Baekje in this year Wushen. That same year they received the ten precepts and six dharmas, and in the following year Jiyou, in the third month, they received full ordination. In the following year Gengxu they immediately returned to Japan, resided at Sakurai Temple, and later resided at Kainoi Temple, which is Toyoura Temple. In this year Wushen, six monks were sent from Baekje: namely Vinaya Master Reishō, Dharma Master Esō, Dharma Master Gōi, Dharma Master Ekun, Dharma Master Dōshō, and Dharma Master Gōkai. They immediately built temporary monks' quarters at Mukuhara village to house these six monks. This was the original Gangōji Temple. This was the foundation of monks and nuns in Japan. Thereafter, monks and nuns gradually increased and filled the country. However, the various conditions were not complete, and ordinations were not performed. The monks who came from other countries were all bhikkhus from their respective countries, but they could not confer full ordination in this country. Subsequently, later monks studied various schools, mastered concentration and wisdom, and intensively researched sutras and treatises. Following the teachings of Zhanche, Yoga and others, some received precepts from others regarding the three clusters, while others obtained good signs and performed self-vow ordination. These were all standard methods of bodhisattva universal ordination. Dharma Master Chikyō first initiated this at Vimalakīrti Hall, and the evidence is clear. When Bodhisattva Gyōki received full ordination following Dharma Master Tokukō,

this was precisely such a case. In the eighth year of Tenpyō, year Hinoe-ne, Great Tang Vinaya Master Dōsen came to court. However, the number of monks was insufficient, so platform ordination could not be performed. From the year Renshin under Emperor Kinmei to the fifth year of Tenpyō-shōhō under the forty-sixth sovereign, Empress Kōken Takano-hime, year Mizunoto-mi (corresponding to the twelfth year of Tianbao under Emperor Xuanzong, the sixth ruler of Great Tang), two hundred and two years had already passed. During this time, precepts and vinaya had not yet been transmitted to this country. However, in the fifth year of Tenpyō under the forty-fifth sovereign Emperor Shōmu (Ama-shirushi-kuni-oshi-hiraki-toyo-sakura-hiko), year Mizunoto-tori (corresponding to the twenty-first year of Kaiyuan in Great Tang), he issued an edict for Master Eiei of Kōfukuji and Great Virtue Fushō to enter Tang for study. When the two worthies reached Tang, they immediately requested Śramaṇa Vinaya Master Dōsen of Dafukuguang Temple in the Eastern Capital to first proceed to Japan to serve as a precept-transmission master. The two Eishō remained in Tang for study. Great Virtue Dōsen was thirty-five years old when, in the eighth year of Tenpyō, year Hinoe-ne (corresponding to the twenty-fourth year of Kaiyuan in Tang), he came to court aboard the ship of Deputy Envoy Nakatomi no Asomi Nashiro. The Great Virtue mastered precepts and vinaya, Huayan, Tiantai teachings, and Northern Meditation, penetrating their profound principles and opening their doctrinal paths. Although he did not perform platform ordination, he lectured on vinaya and opened people's eyes. Long ago when the Nanshan "Jiecho" was first transmitted to this country, there was no one to lecture on it. Meditation Master Dōyū first began reading and lecturing on it. Even before Dōsen, there were lectures in various places. First, Rōben, following instructions from a spiritual dream, first performed posadha at Kinshōji Temple, inviting Master Dōyū to explain the Brahmajāla precepts (following dream instructions). This was the beginning of posadha in Japan. Thereafter, Master Yū lectured on the "Jiecho" at Kenjaku Hall. Dharma Master Chikyō also lectured on vinaya excerpts in various places. When Dōsen came to court, he regularly lectured on vinaya excerpts, resided at Daianji Temple, and at its pagoda compound lectured on vinaya excerpts and discussed various vinaya sections.

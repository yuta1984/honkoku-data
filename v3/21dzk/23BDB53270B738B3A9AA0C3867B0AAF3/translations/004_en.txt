Guzhiduo, followed by Fusha La, followed by Ox Protector, followed by Good Protector, followed by Life Protector, followed by Chada, followed by Yaśa, followed by Putira, followed by Jīvaka, followed by Dharma Protector (the above twenty), followed by Tinaga, followed by Dharma Money, followed by Capable Awakening, followed by Saṅghadeva, followed by Dharma Victory, followed by Pusabhadra, followed by Path Power. From Venerable Upāli at the beginning to Venerable Path Power at the end, a total of twenty-seven people successively inherited, protected, maintained, and propagated [the teachings]. Although that vinaya lists twenty-seven people, it does not clarify how many years had passed since the Buddha's parinirvāṇa. The twentieth master was named Dharma Protector, which is exactly the same as the name at the end of the Four-Part Vinaya. However, this is the root school, while the Four-Part Vinaya master was from the hundred-year period, and among the twenty schools there was the Dharmaguptaka school. The master of that school took the dharma name of the previous person and maintained the root Mahāsāṃghika. What obstacle could there be for that three-hundred-eighty-year period? Although there are personal views, it was propagated for that reason.

Regarding the transmission lineage of the Samantapāsādikā: Upāli, followed by Daśabalakassapa, followed by Suyakassapa, followed by Siggava, followed by Moggaliputtatissa, followed by Mahinda (son of King Aśoka), followed by Ariṭṭha, followed by Tissadatta, followed by Kāḷasumana, followed by Dīghagāma (the above ten), followed by Sumana, followed by Kāḷasumana, followed by Dhammagutta (the above thirteen), followed by Tissa, followed by Deva, followed by Sumana, followed by Soṇaka, followed by Dhammapāla, followed by Erma, followed by Upatissa (the above twenty), followed by Dhammasoṇa, followed by Abhaya, followed by Deva, followed by Sīvali. From Upāli to Sīvali, twenty-four people successively inherited, and together with the previous twenty-seven of the Mahāsāṃghika, all were great arhat venerables who transmitted and maintained the vinaya collection continuously without interruption. The Samantapāsādikā lists the various masters but does not separately specify time periods. However, that treatise states: "At that time, the great virtuous ones

arrived in Ceylon, Mahinda became the elder, and at that time it had been 236 years since the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, when the Buddha's teachings flowed and reached Ceylon" (above). Mahinda was the sixth vinaya transmitter who transmitted and maintained the Buddha's teachings in that era. Regarding the thirteenth Dhammagutta, Master Dingbin of Songyue judged: "That Dhammagutta is precisely this vinaya master" (above).

Upon careful examination now, the Four-Part Vinaya master Dhammagutta appeared a hundred years after the Tathāgata's passing. According to the Samantapāsādikā's intention, the sixth Mahinda appeared over two hundred years later; how much more could the thirteenth correspond? Therefore, it should be said that among the twenty schools, the Dhammagutta school is called Dharmaguptaka, also called Dharmagupta, also called Dharmarakṣa, also called Dharmasoṇa. The Dharmaguptaka arose in 380 years, which corresponds with the time period intended by the Samantapāsādikā. According to Master Songyue's intention, since that [name] is already the same as the hundred-year Four-Part Vinaya master, what obstacle is there for the later Dharmaguptaka to be called this vinaya master? That Samantapāsādikā was composed in 700 years, and the twenty-fourth Arhat Sīvali should correspond to that time. This is how things should be. According to Master Yuanzhao's intention, the later Dharmaguptaka school completely adopted the former name, like the example of Dharmatara.

Regarding the successive transmission of Venerable Kāśyapa: Mahākāśyapa propagated and maintained the Buddha's teachings, and when he wished to enter samādhi, he entrusted the dharma to Ānanda. Ānanda, approaching death, entrusted the dharma to Madhyāntika. Madhyāntika, approaching death, entrusted the dharma to Śāṇakavāsa (although both received from Ānanda, according to the Sarvāstivāda Master-Disciple Transmission, such succession is described). Śāṇakavāsa, about to pass away, entrusted the dharma to Upagupta. This successive transmission is called the "Five Vertical Masters," each propagating the Buddha's teachings for twenty years. Although there were extensions and contractions, speaking generally, by Upagupta's time, a hundred years had already passed. The above five masters generally propagated the Tripiṭaka; we now take only the aspect of their vinaya transmission. Below Upagupta were five disciples:

Dhammagutta, Sarvāstivāda, Mahīśāsaka, Kāśyapīya, and Vātsīputrīya. These five arhats also transmitted the dharma of the Tripiṭaka and Five Collections, but we now also take only the aspect of their vinaya transmission. These five people are now called the "Five Horizontal Masters."

Over a hundred years after the Tathāgata's passing, King Aśoka destroyed the Buddha's teachings, and all the sages flew to the Snow Mountains. Later, they invited the noble assembly to return to various countries. At that time, these five people each recited, compiled, and propagated according to what they had heard. Therefore, the vinayas they compiled were each different: Dhammagutta's vinaya was called Four Parts, Sarvāstivāda vinaya was called Ten Recitations, Mahīśāsaka vinaya was called Five Parts, and Kāśyapīya vinaya was called Explanation. Thus these five schools have been transmitted in the world without interruption.

There is the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya, which is the root school. The previous five school traditions split off from this. This Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya, in the hundred-plus year period, also had arhats who recited, compiled, and propagated it in the world. Therefore, the succession of twenty-seven patriarchs was unbroken. From Path Power downward, various sages received and propagated it.

Also, a hundred years after the Buddha's passing, two schools arose elsewhere: the Mahāsāṃghika and Sthavira schools. Over two hundred years later, gradually splitting from the Mahāsāṃghika, seven schools were formed. From three hundred to four hundred years later, eleven schools emerged from the Sthavira school. Combined with the eighteen schools, together with the original two schools, they formed twenty schools. There were also twelve schools, five hundred schools, etc. Among those schools, there are those called vinaya collections. Although there were these twenty schools, after a long time only five schools remained in circulation: namely, from the Sthavira school: Sarvāstivāda, Vātsīputrīya, Mahīśāsaka, Dharmaguptaka, and Kāśyapīya. These five completely adopted the names and meanings of the five schools from the hundred-year period, hence there are identical names. Therefore, these names became confused, and various masters had different interpretations. The dharma spread throughout the Five Indies (India), flourishing and declining according to the times. When Tripiṭaka Master Yijing crossed to India, the great

framework for propagating dharma in India had four aspects: First, the Noble Mahāsāṃghika school split into seven schools; second, the Noble Sthavira school split into three schools; third, the Sarvāstivāda school split into four schools; fourth, the Noble Saṃmitīya school split into four schools. Emerging from the four root schools, the branch schools totaled eighteen schools. Being thus different, various masters transmitted and inherited continuously without break. Thus each school had its vinaya collection, and in later final periods, study and practice became increasingly flourishing.

Regarding the transmission of precepts and vinaya to China, it was appropriately suited to the times, with accurate transmission without error. Long ago, in the tenth year of Yongping under Emperor Ming of Later Han, [Kāśyapa] Mātaṅga and [Dharmaratna] gradually came and first transmitted Buddhism. The doctrinal foundations were just beginning, and the precept dharma had not yet been transmitted. From the tenth year of Yongping (Dingmao year) onward until the first year of Jiaping under Cao Wei (Jisi year), a total of 183 years passed with the precept dharma not yet reaching [China] (According to Master Bin, from the tenth year of Yongping to the first year of Yongkang under the eleventh ruler Emperor Huan [Dingwei year], 101 years passed with the precept standards not yet clarified).

During this period, various Tripiṭaka masters gradually came and translated and transmitted Mahayana and Hinayana sutras. In the Yongping period of Later Han, two sages transmitted the dharma: Mātaṅga came first and translated the Sutra of Forty-Two Sections, then passed away; Dharmaratna came later (eleventh year of Yongping) and translated several works, then passed away. The years and months are not detailed, but he lived over sixty years (In the eighteenth year of Yongping, Dharmaratna was entrusted to Emperor Ming).

Afterward, from the first year of Jianchu when the third ruler Emperor Zhang ascended the throne (Bingzi year, corresponding to the sixth year Bingzi of Emperor Keiko, the twelfth sovereign of Great Japan) to the first year of Benchu under the tenth ruler Emperor Zhi (Bingxu year), there were a total of seventy-one years. No Indian monks came, and there were no śramaṇas in China (Checking the monk biographies and sutra catalogs shows no records, though in reality there may have been monks with Indian names). In the first year of Jianhe under the eleventh ruler Emperor Huan (Dinghai year), Tripiṭaka Master Lokakṣema arrived and translated various sutras over forty years. In the second year of Jianhe (Wuzi year), An Shigao came and transmitted and translated various sutras over twenty-three years. In the first year of Guanghe under the twelfth ruler Emperor Ling (Wuwu year), Zhu

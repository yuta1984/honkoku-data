The various vinayas of other schools are not essential for our present purposes. However, this represents a complete vinaya collection teaching, and the vinaya collection that the Yogācāra texts point to is not limited to any particular school but comprehensively indicates all approaches. The Great Master Nanshan cited and used other schools to adorn the Four-Part Vinaya, adding meaning and refinement to establish the practices of the unified Mahayana tradition. Therefore, we now comprehensively cite the various vinaya collections.

The Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya in forty volumes, the Saṃghika Bhikṣu Precept Text in one volume, and the Bhikṣuṇī Precept Text in one volume - these constitute the fundamental school's vinaya collection. The Dharmaguptaka Four-Part Vinaya in sixty volumes and the Four-Part Monastic Precept Text in one volume represent the ancient precept text. The Annotated Precept Text in three volumes represents Nanshan's commentary on the ancient precept text, and the Edited Monastic Precept Text was also compiled by Master Nanshan. Nanshan also had an Annotated Nun's Precept Text and an Edited Nun's Precept Text, but these were not transmitted to Japan. The Four-Part Nun's Precept Text was collected by Huaisu, and contemporary nuns all practice according to this text. The recent Master Sairin Sōji's annotated nun's precept text exists in three volumes. The Tanshi Karmavācanā in one volume, Sōgai's Miscellaneous Karmavācanā in one volume, the Nun's Karmavācanā in one volume, and Guṇavarman's translation of the Edited Supplementary Situational Karmavācanā in three volumes were collected by Nanshan. The Four-Part Monastic Karmavācanā in three volumes and the Nun's Karmavācanā in three volumes were both collected by Huaisu. Huaisu's collection of the monastic precept text was not transmitted to the Japanese realm.

The Sarvāstivāda school's Ten-Recitation Vinaya in sixty-one volumes, the Ten-Recitation Bhikṣu Precept Text, the corresponding Nun's Precept Text, the One Hundred and One Karmavācanā, the Ten-Recitation Karmavācanā, and the Essential for Bhikṣus each exist in one volume. The Tripiṭaka Master Yijing translated many Sarvāstivāda vinaya texts: the Fundamental Sarvāstivāda Vinaya in fifty volumes (the bhikṣu vinaya), the Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya in twenty volumes, the Miscellaneous Vinaya Matters in forty volumes, the Nidāna-mātṛkā in ten volumes, the Bhikṣu Precept Sūtra in one volume, and the Bhikṣuṇī Precept Sūtra

【Lower Section】
in one volume, the Vinaya Summary in twenty volumes, the Commentary on the Bhikṣu Precept Sūtra and One Hundred and One Karmavācanā in ten volumes, the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya Verses in five volumes, the Summary Verses of Miscellaneous Matters in one volume, and the Mātṛkā Summary Verses in one volume. The above represents Yijing's new translations of Sarvāstivāda vinaya texts, totaling one hundred fifty-nine volumes. While there are minor differences from the older Ten-Recitation Vinaya, they generally belong to the same school category.

The Mahīśāsaka school's Five-Part Vinaya in thirty volumes, the Five-Part Bhikṣu Precept Text, Five-Part Nun's Precept Text, and Five-Part Karmavācanā each in one volume. The Kāśyapīya school's Liberation Precept Text in one volume. The Bhinnāya Vinaya in ten volumes, the Vinaya Mother Treatise in eight volumes (explaining the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya), the Mātṛkā Treatise in ten volumes (also explaining the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya), the Samantapāsādikā in eighteen volumes (explaining the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya), the Sarvāstivāda Treatise in nine volumes (explaining the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya), and the Twenty-Two Clarification Treatise in one volume (explaining the Saṃmitīya Vinaya). The six works from the Bhinnāya Vinaya onward represent the explanations that various arhats provided for their respective vinayas after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, revealing their principles - these are called vinaya treatises.

Works included solely in the vinaya collection: the Great Bhikṣu Three Thousand Deportments Sūtra in two volumes, the Five Hundred Questions Sūtra in one volume, the Mahāprajāpatī Nun Sūtra in two volumes, the Śrāmaṇera Ten Precepts and Deportments in one volume, the Śrāmaṇera Deportment Sūtra in one volume, the Śrāmaṇerikā Precept Sūtra in one volume, the Śrāmaṇerikā Departure from Precepts Text in one volume, and the Song Dynasty Tripiṭaka Master Shishu's translation of the Śrāmaṇera Protocol Sūtra in one volume consisting only of verses. What has been listed above represents the essential materials from the vinaya section of the catalogues. Other various texts cannot be exhaustively recorded, but all represent the essential core practices for the five categories of renunciants.

Next, we cite commentaries on both general and specific precept reception. The Brahma Net Precept Commentary in two volumes, called the "Meaning Record," was compiled by Master Tiantai. Masters Daoxi, Yunzhai, and Yuxian composed records, all provided in scroll format. Japan's Great Virtue Enrin

composed a four-volume record. A commentary on the same sūtra in one volume, expanded to two scrolls, was compiled by Master Mingkuang. A three-volume commentary on the same sūtra was composed by Master Xianshou. Faxian composed a two-volume commentary... Wonhyo composed a two-volume commentary, but the lower volume is lost. Cheonomu has a two-volume commentary, Daoxuan... Uijŏk composed a two-volume commentary, Seungjang has a two-volume commentary, Taehyeon has the Ancient Traces in two volumes, Zenzhu composed a Brief Extract in three volumes, Risshō composed a four-volume commentary, Shogyō has a one-scroll commentary, and Shunun composed a one-volume commentary.

Each of these various [one character missing] belongs to their respective schools. Tiantai's Mingkuang follows the original master's explanation, used by Tiantai school practitioners. Uijŏk, Seungjang, Taehyeon, and Zenzhu are Yogācāra practitioners who use Puyangzhizhou's five-volume commentary, though it does not represent Yogācāra doctrine but follows the Tiantai approach. Neither school is like devoted study and reliance, but Master Daoxuan composed annotations based on this. Xianshou, Faxian, Wonhyo, Daoxuan, Cheonomu, and Risshō are all used by Huayan school scholars. However, Master Daoxuan's intention lies with Tiantai, while Dharma Master Risshō does not seem to clearly understand the appropriate approach.

Hōshin Daisōzu of Tōdaiji, a disciple of Master Jianzhen, composed the Brahma Net Sūtra Commentary in seven volumes, establishing his interpretation entirely based on Tiantai. Great Master Nanshan has no Brahma Net commentary but follows various masters' interpretations, adding annotations and using them. Masters Tiantai, Xianshou (Xiangxiang), Uijŏk, and others explain the sūtra text following the verses, while Masters Seungjang, Faxian, Daoxuan, and others explain from the beginning prose of the lower volume. Masters Taehyeon, Zenzhu, Hōshin, and others provide comprehensive explanations of both upper and lower volumes. Taking what is essential, it lies in the lower volume section. In the propagation within the Japanese realm, Nanmon vinaya masters frequently use Taehyeon's Ancient Traces, with scholars studying them and each composing notes and records.

Kōshō Bosatsu of Saidaiji has a ten-volume literary collection called the "Supplementary Practice Collection," and also has a structural outline in one volume. Taehyeon's "Essential Principles"

【Lower Section】
in one volume expounds the essential meaning of the Brahma Net, and the Bodhisattva also composed a structural outline in one volume and a literary collection in two volumes. Regarding those Brahma Net Ancient Traces, Keison of Hōtōin composed a literary collection of over ten volumes, Kakuchō of Chisokuin composed a four-volume literary collection, and Zenkan of Kaijūsan composed a nineteen-volume literary collection.

The disciples of Dharma Master Fukaki of Sennyūji lecture on Yuxian's annotated Brahma Net, annotating the Tiantai commentary beneath that base sūtra and immediately explaining that commentary in three volumes. The lineage of Kōben of Kōzanji all lecture on the Xiangxiang commentary, and that temple's dharma master Kikai composed a ten-volume extract explaining the Xiangxiang commentary.

The Original Karma Necklace has Wonhyo's commentary in two volumes, but the bodhisattva precept section lacks separate explanation. That master separately composed the "Essential Record of Maintaining and Transgressing the Bodhisattva Precept Text" in one volume, clarifying the characteristics of bodhisattva precept practice. Regarding the precept perfection section of the Yogācāra texts, Gyeongheung, Dunlun, and others have explanations. Kōshō Bosatsu has complete literary collections that scholars rely upon, greatly nurturing spiritual understanding.

In Great Master Cien's Dharma Garden Chapter, there is a chapter on manifest and non-manifest [karma], establishing ten sections that exhaust the subtle purport of precepts, generally connecting the three vehicles while encompassing the three studies. Nanmon scholars engage in lifelong devoted study. Kōshō Shōnin of Tōshōdaiji has a seven-scroll literary collection, Kōshō Bosatsu has a three-volume literary collection called the "Detailed Essence Collection," and Keison also has a literary collection of over ten volumes. The "Mental Karma Non-Manifest Extract" in one volume by Shōnin Ryōhen of Chikurinji, Great Master Shizhou's "Collection for Arousing the Bodhi Mind" in three volumes clarifying the doctrinal significance and practical characteristics of the two approaches of receiving and maintaining bodhisattva precepts. Kōshō Bosatsu composed a structural text in one volume and a transmission record in one volume. Kōshō Shōnin composed the "Two Receptions Extract" in one volume, thoroughly clarifying the detailed principles of bodhisattva precepts. Shōnin Ryōhen composed a one-volume extract also called the "Two Receptions Extract," and also composed the "Doubt Resolution Extract" in one volume on general reception.

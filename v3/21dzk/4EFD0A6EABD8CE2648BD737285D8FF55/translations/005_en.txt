change. If there were someone who said the Tathagata is impermanent, how would that person's tongue not fall out?" {Note: Above sutra text} That the tongue rots without stopping is still only the flower retribution (present-world consequence). The painful retribution for slandering the dharma flows through long kalpas." {Note: Text}

△Annen's Meaning of Bodhi Mind 4 {Note: 10} says: "Dharma Master Jurei of Todai-ji, clinging to the idea that Buddha suffers, had his body rot and died." {Note: Text}

○The Anraku-shu, Volume 1 {Note: 44} says: "That one type of sage path is difficult to realize in the present time. First, because we are far removed from the Great Sage (Shakyamuni); second, because the principle is deep and understanding is subtle. Therefore the Great Collection Moon Repository Sutra says: In my age of the final dharma, among billions of sentient beings who undertake practices and cultivate the way, not one person attains realization. The present final dharma age is currently this world of five turbidities and evil. Only the single gate of Pure Land can provide a passable route." {Note: Text}

△Daochuo's extreme falsehoods and impermissibility are now compiled and recorded. I hope for investigation and examination. Deep principles and subtle understanding; the sin of slander is extremely grave. The Lotus Patriarch (Nichiren) repeatedly offered compassionate guidance. See Records, sections 29 {Note: 16-17}, 18 {Note: 36}, 11 {Note: 33-37}, 2 {Note: 30}. △Regarding the Great Collection Sutra passage next,

△The Lotus Patriarch's Treatise on Beginner's Buddhahood {Note: Internal 22} says: "That sutra contains no such passage at all. Nor should it exist. As the Buddha's words during his lifetime, it should not speak of 'the present final dharma age of five turbidities and evil.' The principle is clearly evident." {Note: And so on} {Note: Attributing sutra text using the phrase "final dharma present age" is speculative refutation. The National Treatise's direct reference to "Daochuo's words" represents proper style.}

△The Valley Echo Collection by Muso {Note: 54} says: "The Moon Repository Sutra contains no such passage. This text is highly questionable. Even if it were the words of past worthies, it would be difficult to trust." {Note: Text}

△The Compilation and Transmission {Note: 14 sheets} says: "This takes the meaning from the passage about 'the later five hundred years when, in my dharma, there will be contentious arguments

【Page 8, Lower Section】
and disputes, and the white dharma will disappear.'" {Note: And so on} {Note: This Chu is also a great pillar of the Pure Land school. Why has his error and deep deception reached this point?} This distorted doctrine was completely refuted by the Impartial Treatise and String of Pearls Record. They finally lost their deceptive grounds for calculation. However, the doctrinal teachings of the Ran followers (Pure Land adherents), in the Fifteen Hundred Articles Critical Reform 5 {Note: 36}, suddenly changed their calculation saying: "The character 'moon' is a copying error and should be written as 'sun.' From 'my final dharma age' down to the phrase 'those who attain,' this is a paraphrased passage from the Great Collection Sun Repository. From 'the present final dharma age' onward is the collection compiler's own interpretation. Since the collection compiler lived at the beginning of the final dharma age, he said 'the present final dharma evil age.' Since nembutsu is especially for those of inferior capacity in the final dharma age, he encouraged saying 'only the Pure Land single gate exists.' Why do heretical parties slander this, calling it a fabricated sutra?" {Note: Text} The so-called Sun Repository refers to that sutra's sixth volume {Note: 20 sheets right, Protection Chapter} which says: "What is called the final dharma age? It means there are no people who recite, they do not practice according to the Pratimoksha path, if they do not practice meditation, they cannot attain samadhi, and so forth, they do not attain the fourth fruit, and so forth, they do not attain the samadhi of cessation. This is called the final dharma age." {Note: Text}

△Nikko's Profound Doctrine Treatise 5 {Note: 35} says: "Cho violates and transgresses the sutra's intent. When the Moon Repository Sutra speaks of the white dharma disappearing in the later five hundred years, this refers to the general situation, clarifying that there is no practice and realization in the final dharma age. It does not mean that even if beings undertake practices and cultivate the way, not one person attains realization. When Cho quotes this passage saying 'in my final dharma age, among billions of sentient beings, not one person attains,' is this not violating and transgressing the sutra's intent? {Note: To here} Cho's words also contradict what the Sun Repository Sutra teaches. The sutra clarifies that in the final dharma age, there are no fruit-attainers and also no reciters, but this also refers to the general situation, clarifying the absence of practice and realization, not meaning there are no individuals who cultivate the way and attain realization. Cho's statement that 'not one person attains' - is this not also violating and transgressing that sutra's

intent?" {Note: Text}

△Nikkan's Continuation Treatise 5 {Note: 58 sheets} says: "Pointing to the words 'the present final dharma age' and calling them 'the words of compiler Daochuo' - if so, then the words 'only the Pure Land single gate can provide a passable route' should also emerge solely from the mind of Xie (Daochuo). How can this be disputed?" {Note: Text}

△String of Pearls Record 2 {Note: 31 sheets} says: "The Anraku-shu, final volume {Note: 17 sheets} says: 'Like the Sutra of Birth According to Vows states: The Buddha lands of the ten directions are all perfectly adorned and pure, and birth can be attained according to one's vows. Nevertheless, none equals the Western Land of Infinite Life.' {Note: Above} How painful! Not fearing the strict admonition in the Respectful Blessing Sutra that 'adding even one character leads to the path of delusion,' he willfully adds the eleven characters 'nevertheless,' etc. This is a person of inexpressible deviation - how can this be the work of a Buddha's child?" {Note: Text} Incidentally, in both Japanese and Chinese dynasties, Pure Land school predecessors fabricated many sutras and treatises for the sake of partial Amitabha praise. Nichitsu aroused three hundred hearts to prevent this. One must see the Pearl Record {Note: from the beginning to ten}.

△The Sorrow Flower Sutra 3 {Note: Prophecy Chapter} says: "Excluding only those who commit the five grave sins, slander sages, and destroy the correct dharma."

△The Contemplation Sutra {Note: Investigation - the Contemplation Sutra is probably the Larger Sutra} in the eighteenth vow says: "Even if I attain Buddhahood, if the sentient beings of the ten directions with sincere faith and joy wish to be born in my land and practice even ten recitations, if they are not born, I will not take perfect enlightenment. Only excluding those who commit the five grave sins and slander the correct dharma." {Note: Text}

△The Treatise on Establishing Righteousness and Securing the Nation says: "Either abandoning, or closing, or setting aside, or casting away - with these four characters, they lead most people astray. Moreover, they call the holy monks of the three countries and Buddha's disciples of the ten directions all 'bandits,' making them all

subject to cursing. Nearby, this goes against the vow in the Pure Land Three Part Sutras on which they rely: 'excluding only the five grave sins and slandering the correct dharma.' Distantly, they are deluded about the essential heart of the five periods of one lifetime - the admonishing passage in Lotus Sutra chapter two: 'If people do not believe and slander this sutra... that person at life's end enters Avici Hell.'" {Note: To here} How sad! Over several decades, hundreds of thousands of people have been swept away by demonic conditions and largely deluded about Buddhist teaching. They favor the peripheral and forget the correct. Do the good spirits not become angry? They abandon the perfect and favor the partial. Do the evil demons not gain advantage? Rather than performing those myriad prayers, it would be better to prohibit this one evil." {Note: Text}

△The provisional and true vows of all Buddhas. The Lotus Sutra's Expedient Means chapter says: "The original vow of all Buddhas is that through the Buddha way I practice, I universally wish to enable all sentient beings to equally attain this way." The Life Span chapter says: "I always have this thought: By what means can I enable sentient beings to enter the unsurpassed way and quickly achieve Buddha bodies?" Clearly it is known that the original vows of all Buddhas lie in enabling sentient beings to attain the Buddha way. This is generally the true vow of all Buddhas. Like Amitabha's forty-eight vows and Medicine Buddha's twenty-six vows - these are separate vows that accord with capacity and benefit beings. They are provisional vows. Why call them Amitabha's original vow? Like the forty-plus years when separate vows not yet revealing true reality were taught, according with sentient beings of different natures and desires. When the time for Mahayana maturation arrived, the Lotus was correctly taught, saying "Now is exactly that time - I will definitely teach the Mahayana." The vow was fulfilled, saying "Like my past vows, now they are already satisfied, transforming all sentient beings and enabling them all to enter the Buddha way." Revealing the true, it teaches "solely because of the one great matter as cause and condition do I appear in the world." Since Shakyamuni already revealed the true vow, all Buddhas are likewise. Therefore it says "the sixteen princes constantly delighted in teaching this wonderful Lotus Sutra." {Note: And so on}

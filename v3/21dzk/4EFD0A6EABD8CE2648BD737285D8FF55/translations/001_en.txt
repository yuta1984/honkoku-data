On the essence of dharani, one point. Question: Why is the law of dependent origination called dharani? Answer: Within one text, countless meaningful texts are contained. That is, many is one, and one is many, layered infinitely without end, like the jewels in Indra's net. Therefore, the law of dependent origination is called dharani. "According to the deep esoteric teaching" means that mantras are the true aspect of reality, having the undying and unborn mind of the Tathagata as their essence. Question: Why are these mantras called the true aspect of reality? Answer: The aspect of these mantras was not made by any buddhas, nor caused to be made by others, nor rejoiced in. Why? Because this is how the dharma of all phenomena naturally is. Whether tathagatas appear or do not appear, all phenomena naturally abide in this way. {Note: Above from sutra text} Therefore mantras are the true aspect of reality. {Note: And so on} The Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra says: "All phenomena are equal - not made by sravakas, not made by pratyekabuddhas, not made by bodhisattvas, not made by buddhas. Whether there are buddhas or no buddhas, the nature of all phenomena is constantly empty." {Note: Above} These exoteric and esoteric teachings are truly identical. What should be properly explained to guests is that while there may be differences in people between exoteric and esoteric, there are no differences in the dharma. If one forcibly claims they are separate, then the exoteric school deals only with the gate of arising and ceasing, and is not the True Suchness Mahayana at all. The dharmakaya you understand is inferior to the lord of exoteric teaching and does not expound the principle of equality. Therefore, one objects: "This principle is incorrect. My Mahavairocana establishes differences upon the principle of equality, and expounds mudras and mantras upon differences. Why don't the exoteric schools teach mudras and mantras?" Answer: Mudra contracts are the virtues of precept-marks expounded in exoteric teaching. Even if one appears through the empowerment of the three mysteries and emits the light of Mahavairocana's universal illumination, without the virtue of precepts it will not do. Therefore the Secret Key states: "At that time, in the spring of Konin 9 [818], there was a great epidemic throughout the realm. The emperor himself dyed gold on his brush tip, grasped dark blue paper in his palm, and respectfully copied one scroll of the Heart Sutra. I modeled the selection of lectures and discussions, organizing the essential points of the sutra. Before uttering the words of dedication of merit, the families of the recovered filled the roads, night changed and daylight shone brilliantly. This was not due to my foolish person's virtue in precepts, but was accomplished by His Majesty's power of faith." {Note: Above. The emperor was Emperor Saga} Regarding mantras, this is also the same as exoteric teaching. The Nirvana Sutra says: "Both coarse speech and gentle speech all return to the ultimate meaning." {Note: Above} The speech of the tongue faculty is all the same as mantras. How can one say they are separate? However, regarding the aspects of detailed explanation, each school has one virtue. Namely: the 200 and 500 precept aspects of the Vinaya, 80,000 detailed practices, 3,000 deportments {Note: Other schools are not like this}, the ten buddhas of the Avatamsaka {Note: Other schools are not like this}, the 48 minor precepts of the Brahmajala {Note: Other schools are not like this}, the 500 great vows of the Lotus Sutra {Note: Other schools are not like this}, the four sets of ten stages of the Mahayana Abhidharma Sutra {Note: Other sutras are not like this}, the secret epithets and names of the Mahavairocana Sutra and others {Note: Other sutras are not like this}, the 25 perfect penetrations of the Surangama Sutra {Note: Other schools are not like this}. Each of these virtues governs its own school. However, others do not make this their business. {Note: Above} The constant principle of equality is finished, next the constant principle of difference, next the principle of neither same nor different, and so on.

Preface
Master Sun Wu said: "Know the enemy and know yourself, and you will not be in danger in a hundred battles. Not knowing the enemy but knowing yourself, you will win one and lose one. Not knowing the enemy and not knowing yourself, you will be defeated in every battle." Truly these words are correct. Our dharma ancestor, encountering the age of the final dharma and born in the land beyond the eastern sea, illuminated the profound meaning of three thousand realms in one thought-moment, and continued the transmission that had been cut off for 550 years. He raised the banner of the great dharma, beat the drum of fearlessness, and drove the wheel of non-regression to advance against the great enemy. There was no battle he did not win, no attack that did not succeed. That he finally saved sentient beings from water and fire - though this emerged from the divine powers of buddha-wisdom - was fundamentally also the effect of knowing the enemy and knowing oneself. From then onward, there was never a lack of Tendai monks in the world. However, some rigidly defended the fortress of the One Vehicle without investigating the actual circumstances of the four schools, merely boasting and trying to subjugate others. This is like casting a bright pearl into darkness - though the object is beautiful, what benefit is there against the harm of people grasping swords and glaring at each other? For this reason, there were occasionally those who intended to help but instead pushed down, who sought victory but met defeat. This is the disaster of fighting without knowing the enemy - one cannot fail to examine this. Therefore it is said: "Those who underestimate the enemy without consideration will surely be captured." Proceeding from this, the atmosphere became dark and murky, right and wrong became confused, various evils took advantage of the gaps, and fierce flames arose again. Even the brilliant remaining achievements of the patriarch might eventually reach the point of being defeated once and never recovering. Lord Enzan of [Mount] Hiei, fearing this, withdrew to cultivate the teachings of the patriarch, returned to the old government, investigated the enemy's circumstances, and compiled the Essential Texts of the Four Schools to serve as a guide for knowing the enemy. After this, it became like grasping a collar to straighten a robe, or raising a candle to illuminate darkness - the expedient and ultimate of various teachings, the truth and falsehood of other schools, could all be clearly seen as if in the palm of one's hand. Thereupon, victory could be achieved again.

It is regrettable that this book was reduced to ashes in the Tenmei era fires, leaving later students no path to trace. Therefore, {Note: I, Eigu} without measuring my own capacity, have gathered and selected from ancient classics and chosen from various books to supplement those remaining embers. I know this is extremely presumptuous and will not escape criticism and ridicule. However, if later generations cultivate themselves through this, then knowing oneself and knowing the enemy, establishing the brilliant achievement of winning a hundred battles out of a hundred, will not depend on others.

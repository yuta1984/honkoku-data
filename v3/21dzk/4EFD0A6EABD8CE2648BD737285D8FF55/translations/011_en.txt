explaining the dharma for eliminating sins. Having heard this, [the person] rejoices and immediately generates the mind of bodhi. This is called the lower grade, lower birth. This is called the contemplation of lower grade birth. This is called the sixteenth contemplation." {Note: Text}

○Shandao's Commentary on the Contemplation Sutra {Note: Scroll 4} says: "Although one remains in the lotus flower unopened for many kalpas, is this not better than receiving all kinds of suffering for long periods and eternal kalpas in Avici Hell?" {Note: Text}

△The Lotus Sutra says: "On noble and base, high and low, those who maintain precepts and those who break precepts, those with complete deportment and those without, those with right views and wrong views, those with sharp faculties and dull faculties, [the Buddha] equally rains down the dharma rain." {Note: Text}

△Why does Tiantai classify the Contemplation Sutra as sudden teaching? It is said: Because Vaidehi, being the proper recipient, attained realization of the unborn through direct experience, it is judged as sudden teaching. However, this does not mean it is solely perfect [teaching]. Pearls on a String Record 5 {Note: 15}

○One should examine the Yamaga Gien. Breaking the ancient view that "the sixteen contemplations sutra has neither sectarian classification nor doctrinal affiliation," it says: "Before the Lotus, the perfect had not yet opened the partial, so both sectarian and doctrinal affiliations remained. When reaching the Lotus, since the perfect had already opened the partial, nothing is affiliated. Now we ask: regarding the one perfect [teaching] in the main section of the sixteen contemplations, is it for opening or not yet opened? If the partial is not yet opened, how can one say this teaching has no affiliation?" {Note: Text}

○The Testament Sutra {Note: Or possibly the Trapusha Sutra} says: "After the extinction of Shakyamuni Tathagata in the final age, Shandao will appear in the world to guide evil people." {Note: And so on} The compiler says: The Trapusha Sutra has not been examined. The Testament Sutra does not contain this passage. However, the Testament Sutra Treatise {Note: 25} composed by Vasubandhu and translated by Paramārtha says: "Like Shandao showing people the good path." {Note: Above} This is suspected to be a corruption of that text.

○The Great Teacher Dengyō, in his text for worship in the Central Hall, said: "The eternally abiding pure and wonderful dharma-body of the three periods, Mahavairocana, also called Shakyamuni, the teaching master of the wonderful dharma, in the secret of changing times is called Medicine Buddha Lapis Lazuli Light Tathagata." {Note: And so on}

△{Note: Source} Abbreviated, in the Elegant Phrases {Note: End} it says: "I, keeping secret the teaching master of the Lifespan chapter, created an image of the Medicine Buddha as the main object of worship for Enryaku-ji. Since this is not an ordinary Medicine Buddha, in the text for worshipping this main object of worship, one recites 'Buddhas of the Three Periods...'" {Note: Text} Ancestral Writings 8 {Note: 28}

○The Mahāsthāmaprāpta Sutra says: "Those who use flat prayer beads are disciples of heterodox paths, not my disciples. My remaining disciples must use round prayer beads. Those who skip the proper sequence will definitely fall into hell due to the sin of false speech." {Note: Text}

○The Yamamon petition states: "Recently there have been two demonic aberrations that startle people's ears and eyes: namely, the heterodox dharma of Bodhidharma and the mournful sounds of nembutsu. Hōnen's grave site was entrusted to the shrine servants of Kanjin-in to be destroyed. After that, it was reported to the court and permission was received. In early July, following the Eight Lectures at Hōshō-ji, Yamamon contacted Nanto, and around Kiyomizu-dera and Gion, which are branch temples of Nanto and Yamamon, all grass huts where the exclusive practitioners entered were completely destroyed. Orders were given to attendants to arrest them, and the sounds of liturgical chanting and black robes were completely prohibited throughout Kyoto. The three ringleaders {Note: Ryūkan, Jōgaku, Kūa}, although sentenced to exile, escaped before reaching their places of banishment. Yamamon continues to petition about this matter. On this eleventh day, the assembly decided: Hōnen-bō's composition, the Senchaku, is a book that slanders the dharma. It should not be allowed to remain anywhere under heaven. Therefore, all copies held everywhere, along with their printing blocks, should be brought to the Great Lecture Hall and burned to repay the debt to the Buddhas of the three periods. This was petitioned to the court. Surely it will be

decreed. Karyaku 3, tenth month, fifteenth day.

○Also, in a petition from the Kenpō era, it was said: "Recently there have been two demonic aberrations: namely the heterodox dharma of Bodhidharma and the mournful sounds of nembutsu. Heterodox teachings attached to Buddhism have appeared again in our country. These supremely strange aberrations should be feared. Why forcibly select companions of national ruin and wandering to be masters of monastery transmission? It seems as if there were no people in the court. Is this not slandering the era?" {Note: The court teacher selected the essential points and decided on this. Complete text: 36-31 pages}

△From Yamamon, informing the branch temple Unkyo-ji, the document states: "The matter of promptly prohibiting the evil practices of exclusive practice. Recently, ignorant people have formed factions and gathered in secret groups, calling themselves 'exclusive practitioners.' They fill the neighborhoods, having not a bit of wisdom or understanding in their hearts. They speak evil words of various sins from their mouths. Relying on words about the compassionate vows of one thought and ten recitations, they dare not fear the heavy evils of the three poisons and five hindrances. These blind and ignorant people cannot distinguish right from wrong. They simply follow their emotions and mostly believe and submit to foolish teachings. They laugh at people who maintain precepts and cultivate good, calling this 'mixed practice.' They slander the teachings that protect the nation and guard the king, calling this 'demonic activity.' They reject all good practices and select all evils. Their sins accumulate like mountains, and their retribution brings hell. The poisonous energy has penetrated deeply, and though prohibited, there is no reform. They are partial to desires and pleasures and cannot stop themselves. They are like flies stuck by saliva. How different are they from mad dogs chasing lightning while running? They wave their three-inch tongues and pluck out the eyes of sentient beings. To nourish their five-aggregate bodies, they destroy the heart and soul of all Buddhas. They are simply enemies and demons of the Buddha-dharma and should be called the demonic aberrations of the Buddhist order. Therefore, when the heterodox teacher was alive, he was permanently sunk in criminal charges. Now after his death, his corpse and bones were also destroyed. His followers Jūren {Note: Investigation - possibly Ren?}, Anraku were given death in the wilderness. Jōgaku and Sasshō received punishment of exile.

From this present punishment, one can judge their future retribution. Now, to protect the Shakyamuni's remaining dharma and to rescue sentient beings from suffering, it is appropriate to order the branch temples, manor estates, shrine servants, and affiliated people of all provinces to strictly prohibit that heterodox dharma. Even for a moment, do not allow those evil types to lodge anywhere. Even for a single word, do not listen to their heterodox explanations. If there are also those among the various divisions of Yamamon who practice exclusive cultivation, punish them permanently with severe penalties and show no leniency. By the unanimous decision of three thousand monks and students, we command as stated above. Ennō 2 {Note: Era name changed to Jiji}

○In Ichiboku's oath document, it states: "The monk Genkū of Black Valley on Mount Hiei respectfully addresses the abbot of this temple and the precious presence of the Three Treasures, dharma-protecting good spirits. I, Genkū, in the days of my youth, peered through the door of the three contemplations, and now in my declining old age, I study Shandao's commentaries. {Note: The six characters are not in the original text} I aspire to the realm of the nine grades. This too follows the ancient traces of former sages and is not the new vow of one of inferior wisdom. However, recently I have heard rumors that Genkū exclusively recommends the nembutsu teaching and slanders other dharma teachings, causing various schools to decline and various practices to perish. {Note: And so on} Hearing this, my mind and spirit are alarmed and frightened. Finally, when this was heard by Yamamon and discussed among the assembly, it was reported to the chief abbot that severe admonishment should be added. Regarding this matter, on one hand I am saddened by the assembly's investigation, and on the other hand I rejoice in the assembly's kindness. What saddens me is that with this poor monk's body, I have suddenly been subject to prohibitions by the mountain and capital. What delights me is that the name of dharma-slanderer is erased and the slander of Chinese and barbarians is permanently stopped. If not for the assembly's investigation and judgment, how could this poor monk's grief and lamentation be comforted? Generally, Amitabha's fundamental vow says: 'Except only the five grave sins and slandering the correct dharma.' {Note: And so on} How could those who recommend nembutsu slander the correct dharma? Eshin's Essential Collection says: 'Open the one real path and enter the path of Samantabhadra.' {Note: And so on}

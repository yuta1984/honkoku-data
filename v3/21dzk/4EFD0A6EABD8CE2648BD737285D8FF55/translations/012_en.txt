are those who aspire to the Pure Land. How could they abandon the wonderful dharma? Among them, Genkū, during his leisure from nembutsu practice, reads the Tiantai doctrinal texts, concentrates his faith in the streams of Jade Spring, and directs his yearning toward the winds of Silver Pond. His old practices still remain; how could he forget his original mind? He simply relies on invisible observation and looks up to the assembly's examination. However, when those who have renounced the world in old age, those ignorant types who have entered the monastic life, either enter grass huts and shave their heads, or when speaking privately at their windows, they repeatedly advocate that the Pure Land should be what one aspires to and nembutsu should be one's practice. This is because their age has declined and they cannot engage in disciplined practice, their nature is dull and they cannot bear intensive study, so they temporarily set aside the gate that is difficult to understand and difficult to enter, and teach and show the path that is easy to practice and easy to reach. Even the Buddha's wisdom establishes expedient means. How could ordinary consideration lack discretion? I dare not maintain judgments about the right and wrong of teachings; I only consider whether [practitioners'] capacities are suitable or not. If this matter could become a cause for the destruction of the dharma, it would be appropriate to cease it henceforth. The ignorant and benighted should be secretly admonished and it should be stopped. Originally I did not favor teaching and guiding; by nature I do not specialize in propagating the dharma. If beyond this there is propagation through heterodox doctrines or exposure through false statements, there should certainly be investigation and prohibition. Clear admonishment is what I hope for and what I rejoice in. Regarding these details, during the official examination in previous years, I submitted a sworn statement. Since then until now, nothing has changed. Although I cannot repeat [my statement], since the stern admonishment has been repeated, my sworn statement has also been made two or three times. Regarding the above details, if anyone provides false explanations for even one matter or one word, may their daily recitation of 70,000 nembutsu lose all benefit, may they fall into the three evil paths, may their bodies in this life and the next constantly sink into heavy suffering, and may they eternally receive painful torment. I humbly beseech: Brahmā, Indra, the Four Great Heavenly Kings, the great and small deities of Japan's sixty-odd provinces, especially the Three Sages of the Mountain King, all their categories, all the honored ones of this temple, and all the dharma protectors of the entire mountain, please bear witness and observe.

Therefore, the monk Genkū respectfully submits this. Second year of Genkyū, year of the metal ox, second month. {Note: Above} The seven prohibition texts and the original handwriting of this sworn statement are kept at Nison-in in Saga. Recorded in the Rope-Binding Record {Note: 18 pages}.

△The preface to Zhili's Ten Doctrines states: "Those who critique and discuss the Buddha-dharma must understand the doctrine definitively and speak truthfully and sincerely. They must know victory and defeat, be able to advance and retreat. If their minds have no destination, their words contradict themselves, and having already lost they still advance, they absolutely cannot be engaged in discussions about the Way. This is the admonishment handed down by our patriarch." {Note: Above}

The Cessation and Contemplation, Chapter 7 {Note: 77 pages} states: "If the preparatory methods for cultivating and assembling the four kinds of samādhi generally follow the above explanation, only the Lotus Repentance separately takes the six periods and five repentances to create additional preparatory methods. Now, based on the five repentances, their positions and characteristics are clarified." {Note: And so on} The five repentances are: confession, invitation, rejoicing, merit transfer, and vow-making.

○The Ten Chapters of Cessation and Contemplation [Chart showing the structure of the ten chapters of Cessation and Contemplation and their relationship to the four kinds of samādhi]

1. Constantly Sitting Samādhi {Note: Main object of worship is Amitabha, also Mañjuśrī. Based on the Mañjuśrī Sūtra and Mañjuśrī-paripṛcchā in the Prajñāpāramitā section}

【Page 23, Upper Section】
2. Constantly Walking Samādhi {Note: Main object of worship same as above. Based on the Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra in the Vaipulya section}
3. Half-Walking Half-Sitting Samādhi {Note: Main object of worship is the Seven Buddhas, also Samantabhadra. Based on the Vaipulya Sūtra and Lotus Sutra}
4. Neither-Walking-Nor-Sitting Samādhi {Note: Main object of worship is Avalokiteśvara. Based on the meaning of the Mahāprajñāpāramitā, concerning the three natures of good, evil, and neutral in various sutras}

○Miaolle's Hongje 5 {Note: Upper, beginning} says: "As in the Great Intention section, although it speaks of the ten different types of generating the aspiration and the four kinds of samādhi to clarify the differences in practice, it merely lists the categories and the explanation of characteristics is insufficient. Therefore, it has not yet engaged with the ten objects and ten contemplations. When preparatory [practices] are compared to the proper, they somewhat resemble the beginning of practice. If compared to proper contemplation, practice has not been discussed at all." {Note: Text}

○The Profound Meaning 9 {Note: 37 pages} says: "{Note: Below the judgment of coarse and subtle} According to the methods of various sutras, practices like constantly walking use the subsidiary as the essence. Both essence and practice are coarse. Using the proper as essence, then practice is coarse but essence is subtle." {Note: Text}

○Hongje 2 {Note: Original 2} says: "All four practices condition true characteristics." {Note: Text}

△Miaolle's Principles of Cessation and Contemplation {Note: First page} says: "Scattered quotations from various texts encompass the entire [Buddha's] lifetime [of teaching]. The proper meaning of the textual style returns only to two sutras {Note: Lotus and Nirvana}. Up to... this is true characteristics, serving as the proper essence of practice. {Note: Up to} Therefore, from beginning to end, all depends on the Lotus. This is precisely the wonderful practice of Lotus Samādhi." {Note: Text}

△The Jade-Binding Record 4 {Note: 70 pages} says: "The four kinds of samādhi in Cessation and Contemplation have different practices but the same principle. Therefore, they equally use the dharma of the ten vehicles and all reveal the true characteristics of the Lotus. Therefore, in constantly sitting, recollecting Amitabha as a response-body Buddha is certainly not the proper practice of cessation and contemplation. It is only when external obstacles like drowsiness arise that one temporarily recollects the response-body as an auxiliary condition. The Tiantai Master Zhiyi established the wonderful practice of Lotus opening and revelation, and temporarily as an auxiliary

【Page 23, Lower Section】
condition recollected Amitabha as a response-body Buddha. This is nembutsu based on opening and revelation. How could this be the same as the exclusive practice of nembutsu established by Shandao and Hōnen?" {Note: Text}

○The text of Cessation and Contemplation 2 {Note: 9. Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra. Constantly Walking Samādhi} states: "If one chants Amitabha, this is chanting the merits of the Buddhas of the ten directions equally. But exclusively using Amitabha as the master of the dharma gate. To state the essential point: step by step, sound by sound, thought by thought, one abides only in Amitabha Buddha. When discussing cessation and contemplation in terms of intention, one contemplates Amitabha Buddha of the Western [Pure Land], located ten billion Buddha-lands away from here, in the center of jeweled ground, jeweled ponds, jeweled trees, jeweled halls, and bodhisattvas, sitting and expounding the dharma." {Note: Text} The same {Note: 6 pages} says: "Constantly Walking Samādhi: first clarify the method, then encourage its cultivation... This dharma appears in the Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra." {Note: Text}

△The Mañjuśrī Sūtra says: "Good sons and good daughters, if you wish to enter the One-Practice Samādhi, you should dwell in a quiet place, abandon all distractions, let your mind not grasp at forms, bind your mind to one Buddha, exclusively recite the name, follow that Buddha's location, straighten your body and face correctly, be able to focus on one Buddha with thoughts continuously connected. In this recollection, you can see all Buddhas of past, future, and present. Why? The merit of recollecting one Buddha is immeasurable and limitless, and is not different from the merits of immeasurable Buddhas. The inconceivable Buddha-dharma is equally without discrimination. All ride the one suchness and achieve supreme perfect enlightenment, all fully possessing immeasurable merit and immeasurable eloquence. Those who thus enter One-Practice Samādhi completely know the non-differentiated characteristics of the dharma realm of Buddhas numerous as the sands of the Ganges." {Note: Text}

△The Yogācāra Treatise by Bodhisattva Maitreya {Note: 38, 5th left} says: "All Tathāgatas, all merits, are equally equal without any difference. Only four dharmas are excepted: first, lifespan; second, name; third, lineage

preserve this sutra and let it remain for one hundred years. If there are sentient beings who encounter this sutra, according to their wishes, all can attain the Way. △The Great Amitabha Sutra (translated by Zhi Qian), which is a different translation of the same source, states: "After I pass into nirvana, the scriptural Way will remain for one thousand years. After one thousand years, the scriptural Way will be cut off. I, with universal loving-kindness, will especially preserve this sutra-dharma and let it remain for one hundred years. When the hundred years end, it will cease and be cut off. According to what the heart wishes, all can attain the Way." The different translation, the Sutra of Equal Enlightenment, states: "After I pass into nirvana, the scriptural Way will remain for one thousand years. After one thousand years, the Way of attainment will be cut off. According to what the heart wishes, all can attain the Way." By criticizing them based on the above, the Buddha's intention becomes clear.

○The Liturgy for Rebirth states: "When ten thousand years pass and the Three Treasures perish, this sutra will remain for one hundred years. At that time, those who hear even one moment of mindfulness will all attain birth in that [Pure Land]." (Shan)dao's personal feelings are extreme—his face is like iron. The Western Essential Decisions by Cien mentioned in the old text has the same meaning as the Liturgy. I now omit it to avoid tedium.

△The Śrīmālādevī Sutra 4 states: "Just as when the kalpa ends in conflagration, the various ponds, lakes, rivers, and springs dry up first, and then the great ocean finally disappears completely, so too when the True Dharma perishes. The various practices, minor paths, and minor dharmas perish first, and then the True Dharma of the bodhisattva's ocean-like mind finally disappears."

○Sentence Commentary 2 states: "When the praise is already mistaken, slander is contained within it. This in turn creates both the slanderers of addition and subtraction. What can this be called 'praising virtue'?" ○The Record states: "Since the various masters do not understand the five periods, how can they know

【Page 28, Lower Section】
the original and trace aspects of bodhisattvas? Therefore it says 'the praise is already mistaken, etc.' To praise the Shared [teaching] using the Tripiṭaka already constitutes an error. To praise the Perfect [teaching] using the Partial—no fault could be greater. 'Creating both the slanderers of addition and subtraction' means that this one mistaken doctrine attracts two faults. The sutra has no three teachings, yet they painfully want to add them. To suppress the Perfect and establish the Partial—could subtraction exceed this?"

△The Dharma Preaching chapter of the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings states: "Previously, under the bodhi tree at the place of enlightenment, sitting upright for six years, I attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Observing all phenomena with the Buddha eye, they are not suitable for preaching. Why? Because I know that sentient beings' natures and desires are not the same. Since their natures and desires are not the same, I preached various dharmas. Preaching various dharmas through the power of expedient means for forty-plus years, I have not yet revealed the true reality. Therefore sentient beings attain the Way through different [paths] and cannot quickly achieve unsurpassed bodhi."

△The (Dengyō) Great Master's Commentary states: "The teachings that Śākyamuni preached during his lifetime of forty-plus years roughly comprise four teachings and eight teachings. Namely: the Avataṃsaka at the tree king, the Āgamas at the deer park, the Vaipulya in the monastery, the Prajñāpāramitā at Vulture Peak and elsewhere, expounding the One Vehicle. Great and small bodhisattvas practice through countless kalpas. The Tripiṭaka teaching of the Lesser Vehicle, the Shared teaching of the Greater Vehicle, the Distinct teaching of the Greater Vehicle, the Perfect teaching of the Greater Vehicle, sudden teaching, gradual teaching, indeterminate teaching, secret teaching—such as these, the former four flavors each differ from the others. Therefore they are called 'preaching various dharmas.' Speaking of 'through the power of expedient means' refers to preaching only the provisional teachings that follow others—the One Vehicle that carries the provisional through the expedient distinctions of the five natures and other outer gate methods—without yet revealing the One Vehicle that abandons the provisional—the true reality of equal and direct path of the One Buddha Vehicle that follows oneself in the open ground. Therefore it says 'through expedient means.' Not yet understanding the ocean route of the direct path One Vehicle, not yet boarding the solid ship of the pure perfect six pāramitās, not yet obtaining the favorable wind of true reality expedient means, therefore walking on foot the dangerous roads of the horizontal path Three Vehicles, encountering many

【Page 29, Upper Section】
obstacles through countless kalpas. This is the great river of diligent suffering and false thinking in dreams. Therefore it says 'cannot quickly achieve unsurpassed bodhi.'"

△Profound Meaning 5 states: "The Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings says: 'Since attaining the Way forty-plus years ago, I have not yet revealed the true reality. The Lotus first reveals the true reality.'"

△Also, the Dharma Preaching chapter states: "Initially I preached the Four Noble Truths and Twelve-link Dependent Origination, then preached the Vaipulya twelve-division sutras, Mahāprajñāpāramitā, and Avataṃsaka ocean-emptiness, appropriately preaching that bodhisattvas practice through countless kalpas."

△The Sentence Commentary states: "If the Buddhas of the ten directions preach only one dharma, this is the one teaching. Using provisional names to guide is the expedient teaching. Reviewing the three provisional teachings to reveal the one teaching of Buddha wisdom—this text is clear." The same work states: "The Five Vehicles are crooked, not straight. The Shared and Distinct are partial and subsidiary, not correct. Now all abandon that partial crookedness and preach only the correct direct one path."

△The Protective Chapter states: "Regarding the One Buddha Vehicle: this is the fundamental Lotus teaching... Outside the Wonderful Lotus, there is not even one sentence of sutra. Outside the One Buddha Vehicle alone, there are no other vehicles, etc."

○Essential Decisions on the One Vehicle, Lower volume, states: "Since the Buddha already said that the Lotus is true reality and that reality was not yet revealed before, why do you stubbornly oppose the Buddha's teaching and become an enemy of the Lotus?"

△Appendix: Refutation of Shinran

The Illustrated Biography of Shinran states: "In the third year of Kennin (1203), year of the water boar, on the fifth day of the fourth month, at the hour of the tiger in the night, Shinran's dream record states: The Salvation Bodhisattva of Rokkakudō manifested the form of a holy monk with dignified countenance, wearing a white hemp kaṣāya, sitting on a vast white lotus, and commanding Zenshin, saying: 'Should the practitioner's karmic retribution involve sexual misconduct with women, I will become a jeweled maiden and be violated. During one lifetime I will be able to adorn [him], and at the end of life I will guide him to birth in the Pure Land of Bliss.'"

In the text on Avalokiteśvara's universal manifestation of physical forms in the Great Buddha Crown Śūraṅgama Sutra 6, it states: "If there are women who enjoy studying to leave home and uphold various precepts, I will manifest the form of a bhikṣuṇī before them and preach the Dharma for them, causing them to achieve [enlightenment]... If there are sentient beings who do not destroy their male organ, I will manifest the form of a young man before them and preach the Dharma for them, causing them to achieve [enlightenment]."

The Continuation of Lineage Treatise 1 states: "Although Ran [Shinran] is ignorant, he is also one member of the Sangha Treasure that maintains [the Dharma]. How could he be someone who should be saved through a woman's body? How could the great being of universal manifestation and equal flow have such a command that does not correspond to his human status?... Since it [the sutra] distinguishes those who do not destroy their male organ, how could there be the principle of 'I will become a jeweled maiden and be violated'?... Even if there were such a dream revelation, if Ran had even a little human conscience, he should still reflect. The Nirvana Sutra says: As in the Gośīrṣa Sutra, the Buddha spoke to Gośīrṣa: 'Even if heavenly demons or Brahmā transform into Buddha form, complete with the adornment of thirty-two marks and eighty excellent characteristics, with a circular light extending one fathom and perfect countenance, still...

Eyes etc. are only for the use of non-aggregate others. To refute this doctrine, further making a contradictory [inference] saying: Eyes etc. should be for the use of aggregate others. Therefore the Sāṅkhya master again challenges the Western Region [master]. One should say: Dignāga's disciple is not skilled in our doctrine. I permit that conventional self also uses eyes etc. How could there be no conventional self capable of reception and use regarding eyes etc.? Therefore there is still the fault of accordant [thesis]. However, if one says "How could there be no spirit-self capable of reception and use?", this acknowledges the Western Region's counter-rescue, and is no longer the Sāṅkhya's challenging tendency. Based on this, masters like Pingbei explain that "capable of reception and use" means precisely the conventional self《etc.》. This doctrine accords with the text and properly follows the challenging intention. If according to the Bright Lamp Commentary's intention, the Western Region's contradictory [inference] is reformed into a correct inference, while Sāṅkhya's accordance creates a spurious refutation in vain.

Explaining: Generally when the Sāṅkhya master establishes this inference, the intention is precisely to show that the five sense-organs like eyes furthermore have a capable-using other. That capable-using other is precisely the spirit-self. Through this principle, one knows that spirit-self truly exists. Therefore the Saptatatisāstra says: "Other is precisely self. Therefore we know self truly exists"《etc.》. Thus, Sāṅkhya's fundamental intention only shows that eyes etc. have a capable-using other, not discussing the doctrine of true-false two others' use and non-use. However the Western Region dharma master, confused about Sāṅkhya's mind, now establishes the "must serve other's use" inference, further claiming to block conventional other's use and only take true other, repeatedly describing counter-rescue, saying Sāṅkhya's "eyes etc. are only for non-aggregate other's use." Therefore the Sāṅkhya master again challenges this rescue, saying "Dignāga's disciple is not skilled in our doctrine." Spirit-self receives and uses the twenty-three principles constituted by the three guṇas. How could there be no spirit-self other capable of reception and use regarding eyes etc.? Now establishing this inference precisely shows this meaning. It does not mean only true other's use while conventional other does not use.

Therefore now taking spirit-self as "capable of reception and use" still accords with the challenging intention and can follow the commentary text. Therefore the Bright Lamp Commentary says: "Now my fundamental intention does not discuss the doctrine of eyes etc.'s true-false two others' use and non-use. Only discussing that eyes etc. have a capable-using other. That capable-using other is precisely spirit-self"《etc.》. However regarding Master Pingbei's mind, it further does not follow the commentary text. Above it already says "spirit-self receives and uses the twenty-three principles constituted by the three guṇas." The text's words neighbor "use," so it should correspond to spirit-self. Why take conventional self as "capable of reception and use"? Moreover citing some treatise below, further concluding this, saying "therefore eyes etc. truly accomplish and also use." If according to this explanation, one should say "conventional self also uses." Therefore that record's intention further does not trust using this.

Above copied and written from the Monastic Director's excerpts.

The Monastic Director says: Therefore Keisuke's former lecture challenged saying: If so, Cien's "conventional other's use surpasses" contradictory [inference] seems to become useless. Only establishing that there exists a capable-using other. Why transcend discussing the superiority and inferiority of the two uses?

○ What substance is the commonly acknowledged existence?
The Monastic Director says: Therefore Tanshū's former lecture said: It is precisely real existence. Real existence and commonly acknowledged existence - their substances are different. Namely, real existence is discussed regarding capable-having. Commonly acknowledged existence is not so. Therefore the two existences have different substances.

The Monastic Director further says: This Tanshū doctrine has conflicting text in the Compilation Essentials. Namely, now taking this non-non meaning as the text of capable-having.

The second volume private record says: The separate administrator Teishōbō of Saidaiji says: The teacher-master initially explained the teaching for the five categories. There are substance-sentences. There are quality-sentences. There are action-sentences.《etc.》. There are similarity-difference sentences. There are combination sentences. Disciples accordingly immediately believe there exist substance, quality, action, etc. That word "existence" is neither existence separate from substance nor existence identical to substance. This is then the existence commonly acknowledged by teacher and disciples. This is precisely what the world calls existence and calls non-existence. The existence of existence-non-existence. This is called the third commonly acknowledged existence《etc.》. Therefore the Brief Compilation says: "The meaning of non-non is commonly acknowledged as existence. This existence-nature is the substance of the subject"《etc.》.《This doctrine is profound and subtle. Later scholars should believe it. It should be kept secret, kept secret》

The Monastic Director inquires saying: That word "existence" being "neither existence separate from substance nor existence identical to substance" - does this definitely refer to commonly acknowledged existence?

Question: What other doctrine should be maintained besides this?

Answer: There is nothing to think of.

○ Like Buddhist dharma saying there is form and contamination

The Monastic Director says there is nothing to point to.

○ The cause also does not pervade

Question: When the three inferences "existence-nature is non-substantial" etc. are established separately, in the one inference "non-substantial," is the subject "existence-nature" the non-non existence on the three sentences, or rather the non-non existence on the substantial sentence? If saying it is the non-non existence on the three sentences, regarding the non-non existence on quality-action, when saying "non-substantial," it should commit the fault of partial accordance. Moreover, the Judgment says:《Note: The original margin says: The private record should be seen.》"Therefore we know each accomplishes on the three sentences"《etc.》"How to make the cause of subject svarūpa contradiction?"《etc.》.《Note: The original guide says: The commentary says: The three inferences each take their own sentence's capable non-non nature as subject. As the Meaning Judgment says: Therefore we know each accomplishes the non-non existence on the three sentences for the three inferences, showing there is separation from the three, etc.》Based on this text's meaning, it appears to be the non-non existence on the substantial sentence. If relying on this and saying so, the commentary says: "Existence-nature as subject being non-substantial, combined with predicate is named thesis. This word 'existence-nature' is commonly acknowledged by both sage and five categories, being the capable non-non nature on substance-quality-action, therefore becoming the subject"《etc.》. Also saying: "Existence-nature as subject is the capable-having nature of substance-quality-action"《etc.》"After making one thesis of non-quality non-action, the latter two theses' predicate and subject are the same as before"《etc.》. Based on these texts, it appears to be the non-non existence on the three sentences.

Three inferences mutual interchange《or differential mutual thesis》both not established《Ryōsen's doctrine》
Now "this cause also does not pervade" means: When the causes of the three inferences "existence-nature is non-substantial" etc. are mutually taken differentially, all have the fault of non-pervasion. Now regarding the one inference "non-substantial," using the quality-action cause has the fault of non-pervasion《saying》. Question: Having the fault of non-pervasion - what does this mean? Answer: Now the subject of the existence-nature inference takes the non-non existence on the three sentences as subject. However when establishing the three inferences separately, regarding the existence-nature non-substantial inference, it is only limited to the non-non existence on substance. Regarding the latter two theses, it is regarding self-sentence non-non. However when the three inferences are separate, each uses its own sentence's one cause, not mixing and taking the three causes. The reason for this is: When using the inference of non-substantial, if using the cause of having quality-action, there should be the fault of non-pervasion. The subject is only the non-non existence on the substantial sentence, not the non-non existence on quality-action. How could the non-non existence on substance have quality-action? Therefore not using the quality-action cause, only taking the cause of having one substance. The latter two

Answer: It should not be differentiated. Therefore, the Zuanyo states: "We only dispute whether awareness is thought or not thought."

Question: The treatise states: "When the particular is detached, it becomes non-established; on what does the general depend for establishment?" How should this be reconciled?
Answer: The treatise text follows the ancient masters.

Question: Can Bhāviveka's inference's "like illusion" analogy be differentiated?
Answer: Due to the deficiency of the analogical substance, it can be differentiated.

Question: Regarding the Sāṅkhya school's intended meaning in dharma-differentia, is it "superior-superior" or "superior-inferior"?
Answer: It is superior-inferior.

Question: What is the content of superior-inferior?
Answer: When the Sāṅkhya school establishes "eyes, etc., must be used for others," it reveals the meaning that the self (puruṣa) enjoys them. There is no intention that a provisional self uses them. When Paramārtha's Seventy investigates true-other and provisional-other, true-other means superior usage, and provisional-other means inferior usage. Therefore, the intended meaning is superior-inferior. The commentary's text "superior-inferior differentia, etc." refers to this.

Question: In the Lamp's inference about "the self that I grasp as mine," how is it that under the term "self," one examines the fault of subject-differentia?
Answer: The dharma-differentia's statement "necessarily for the use of others" relies on a simple inference and has the fault of predicate non-establishment. That Lamp inference relies on a compound inference and has no fault of subject non-establishment.

Question: Are there proof texts for simple and compound inferences?
Answer: There are no specific proof texts. It is common practice in logic.

Question: How about the Western Region master's explanation?
Answer: As in the second volume private record.

Question: What about the text "should not generate different awareness in the middle"?
Answer: As in the second volume private record.

Question: Where is the dharma spoken of in the subject-svarūpa inference located?
Answer: Among the four traditions, in the Vaiśeṣika's intended meaning, in the inference "existence exists apart from substance," "existence apart from substance" is the established dharma. This meaning accords with the text "dharma means the predicate."

Question: Is the contradicting inference of subject-svarūpa a hetero-inference or a shared inference?
Answer: When the contradicted inference makes the intended meaning identical with the explicit statement, it becomes a self-inference. At that time, the contradicting inference becomes a hetero-inference. The Zuanyo's text "if shared self-inference, etc." refers to this. When the contradicted inference's explicit statement and intended meaning are separate, it becomes a shared inference. At that time, the contradicting inference is also a shared inference. The commentary's "because the words are the same but meanings different, there are no various faults" means this.

Question: What about the Zuanyo's text "there is provisional narration like this"?
Answer: The sixth question and answer in the commentary are all provisional narrations.

Question: What about the commentary's text "what the treatise explains are all shared inferences contradicting the shared"?
Answer: "All shared inferences" refers to the contradicted thesis. "Contradicting the shared" refers to the contradicted reason and analogy. This text does not extend to the contradicting [inference].

The above: "Question" represents this fool's words. "Answer" represents Dharma Master Ekyō's words. Among these, "Self-question" represents the Dharma Master's self-questioning. Ninpei second year, twelfth month, third day. During conversation with the Dharma Master, I recorded this in his presence.

Question: Among the many traditions regarding "the reason also does not pervade," which tradition should be maintained?
Answer: The subject "existence" is existence above the three categories. Therefore, the reason "having and lacking substance" only appears to have "substance category lacking substance." In reality, there is also "lacking substance" in quality and activity categories. Hence it is said "the reason also does not pervade."

Question: What about Ryōsen's doctrine of the three inferences mutually having "both parties non-establishment"?
Answer: This doctrine does not accord with the commentary's text "seemingly only the able, etc." Therefore, I am not satisfied with it.

Question: How does it not accord with the commentary text?
Answer: The doctrine of three inferences mutually having "both parties non-establishment" means that when establishing the three inferences separately, during the "existence is non-substantial" inference, the subject "existence" is limited to "non-substantial" and does not extend to "non-quality, non-activity." If so, one should not place the words "seemingly only." Therefore, it does not accord.

Question: Is subject-differentia the original formulation or a separate formulation?
Answer: It is the original formulation.

Question: Is it double or single?
Answer: It is double intended meaning.

Question: The Duan states: "Now, relying on intended meaning, we create difficulties to establish faults, therefore it is not explicit statement." Does that intended meaning create "existence-conditional nature" intention or "great existence-conditional nature" intention?
Answer: It creates "existence-conditional nature" intention.

Question: What is the substance of creating "non-existence-conditional nature"?
Answer: I have not determined this yet.

Question: Is the subject "existence" in the third and fourth contradiction inferences something commonly accepted as not non-existent, or existence apart from substance?
Answer: Since it has already become a self-inference, it is existence apart from substance.

【Lower Section】
Question: If we say "existence apart from substance," the commentary states: "existence is already the subject-svarūpa; creating existence-conditional existence and creating non-existence-conditional existence is subject-differentia." How should this be reconciled?
Answer: Although it is a self-inference, because "great existence" is not stated, we examine this intended meaning. It is like examining real-self and provisional-self under "that self I grasp as mine."

Question: Regarding "naturally, all remaining dharmas enter the positive analogy," etc., should one use the Myōtōshō or rely on the Shū-ki?
Answer: One should use the Shū-ki.

Question: Regarding "if there is both parties non-establishment," does nothing correspond at all? Does everything correspond? Do partial cases correspond while complete cases do not correspond?
Answer: I have not determined this yet.

The above recorded in the presence of the Dharma Master on Ninpei second year, twelfth month, seventeenth day.

Question: What about the analogy between self and other?
Answer: "Other" does not unite true and provisional others. That other is only true-other. The Sāṅkhya's original intention is like this. Therefore, one should not analogize that because others have true and provisional, selves have true and provisional.

Question: Does the Sāṅkhya school have intended meanings of true-other usage and provisional-other usage beforehand?
Answer: There is only the intended meaning of true-other usage. There is no provisional-other usage. When Paramārtha's Seventy investigates, the two usages of true and provisional first emerge.

Question: Is the contradicting inference of subject-svarūpa a shared inference or hetero-inference?
Answer: It is a shared inference. Therefore, the commentary states: "They first generally explain," etc.

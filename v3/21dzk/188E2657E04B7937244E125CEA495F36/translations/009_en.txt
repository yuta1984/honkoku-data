Minister of the Left Commentary《Lower Volume》

From the 30th day of the 2nd month of Kyūju 2nd year onwards. Monastic Director Ekyō teaches Buddhist logic. 《I myself have resided in Uji since the 28th day. The Monastic Director has come to reside in Uji since the evening of the 29th day.》

○ There are four types of contradictions
　The Monastic Director says "There are no specific matters"

○ The matter of the diligence-arising cause having partial inability to establish
The Nine Sentence Private Commentary says: There is a transmission that says: When broadly establishing the impermanence thesis through similar instances, all impermanent things become similar instances. Although lightning is not diligence-arising, because the meaning of impermanence is equal, lightning and jars are raised as similar analogies. If one places the words "all universally" when making the combination, it can be combined, therefore there is no such fault. What does this mean? When [saying] "all things of diligent intervalless arising nature are seen to be impermanent," since lightning is not diligent, the cause is not related《etc.》.

The Monastic Director says: This doctrine is extremely subtle. It should be used. This is a doctrine that ordinary people do not easily understand.

○ Do the sound-production theorists establish the diligence-arising cause?
The Monastic Director says: Since sound-production [theorists] establish that all sounds are eternal, they do not establish the diligence-arising cause. 《Because external sounds are not diligence-arising》If discussing internal sounds, there should be no hindrance for sound-production [theorists] to establish the diligence cause.

　Textual evidence that sound-production [theorists] establish the diligence-arising cause

【Lower Section】
In the Nyāyamukha's section on fallacious types, we see that the diligence-arising cause applies to both production and manifestation schools. Based on this, the upper volume presents "bilateral substantial partial non-establishment" saying: When Vaiśeṣika, opposing sound-production [school], establishes "all sounds are impermanent," both schools only permit that internal sounds have diligence-arising, while external sounds do not《etc.》. Thus we know: Do sound-production theorists establish the diligence cause? Additionally, in the middle volume text we see sound-production [theorists] establishing the diligence cause《etc.》.

○ Do the production-manifestation two schools jointly permit internal and external sounds to be eternal?
The Monastic Director says: Looking at various commentaries, sound-manifestation theorists calculate that both internal and external sounds are eternal. However, the diligence-arising cause is limited only to internal sounds.

○ "Wishing to make students know that causes are definitive and not faults of analogies"《etc.》.
The Monastic Director says: "Not being faults of analogies" means that the four contradictions are faults of causes. They are not faults of analogies, not preventing other faults from being in analogies.

This doctrine agrees with my humble opinion of recent days.

○ "Because various non-fallacious establishments have the characteristics of these faults"《etc.》.
The Monastic Director says: Monastic Director Eichō says: Because various non-fallacious establishments have the characteristics of these faults.
Objection: This doctrine contradicts the text below "therefore in fallacious establishments one does not see their faults."

　The Monastic Director's own doctrine receives no answer to the difficult question

○ "If one says eyes etc. must serve my use, there is predicate non-establishment, lacking similar analogies, the aggregate-nature cause violates dharma-svarūpa"《text》.

　The matter of self-other mutual analogy
First, when establishing "must serve my use," having predicate non-establishment means: generally when Sāṅkhya establishes this inference, the original intention is to manifest the doctrine that among the twenty-five principles, the spirit-self principle receives and uses eyes etc. Regarding the doctrine of provisional self's reception and use, both proponent and opponent permit it. Why would they begin disputing that reception and use? Therefore, when now establishing "must serve my use," it must necessarily be spirit-self. If this is spirit-self, how could it not commit the fault of other's predicate non-establishment? However, regarding the fact that the word "self" penetrates to provisional self, therefore one should not commit the predicate non-establishment fault: generally Sāṅkhya's original intention is said to avoid mutual agreement. Therefore the commentary says: "If establishing that eyes etc. serve provisional other's use would be mutual agreement and extreme establishment"《etc.》. Therefore Sāṅkhya's original intention: if relying on words regarding provisional self, immediately fears the opponent would attach the fault of mutual agreement. So-called provisional self's reception and use is also permitted by Buddhist dharma. If words do not distinguish, how would this not invite the fault of mutual agreement? However, regarding the word "other," that analogy is not equal. Now establishing "must serve other's use" immediately manifests that there is a capable-using other above eyes etc. Generally examining the Kapila school, using five types of causes, immediately accomplishes the doctrine of spirit-self's real existence. This present "must serve other's use" inference is precisely the first "aggregate for other's sake" cause. So-called aggregate collection laws must serve others' use. Like bedding etc. Eyes and other five cognitive faculties, being already aggregate-nature, must necessarily have a capable-using other that uses these. That capable-using other is precisely spirit-self. Due to this principle, one knows self's real existence. Therefore the Sāṅkhya-kārikā says "Other is precisely self, therefore knowing self's real existence"《etc.》.

【Lower Section】
Therefore, the proponent's original intention manifests that above eyes etc. there is additionally a capable-using other. If accomplishing the capable-using other, it must necessarily be called spirit-self. This then, looking toward eyes etc. themselves, names spirit-self as "other." Generally speaking "other" is permitted language. Precisely because it is the nomenclature of self-other. This is not relying on words regarding provisional other to falsely establish true other. Already being so, it is also the same as provisional self. How would it not be mutual agreement? Therefore in the proponent's intention, the two words self-other completely do not mutually correspond.

○ Predicate non-establishment, lacking similar analogies《Lacking similar analogies means: among the lacking-diminishing fault-natures, it is substantial lacking. Not included in the thirty-three faults.》
Doubtfully saying: Lacking similar analogies is precisely lacking-diminishing fault-nature and should not be included in the thirty-three faults. This principle should not be so. Generally in Buddhist logic dharma, faults of ability-to-establish do not exceed the thirty-three faults. This present lacking-diminishing fault-nature should also be included in these. Why call it a separate fault? Moreover, after Dignāga, regarding the three characteristics of causes, precisely establishing lacking-diminishing fault-nature. Therefore according to appropriateness, it must be included in the thirty-three faults. Why call it a separate fault? Due to this, the commentary's text below says: "Also like the treatise explains: the sound-permanence thesis's dharma-svarūpa cause, opposing the void-school, lacks similar analogies"《etc.》. Here we know: although lacking the similar analogy component, still discussing faults regarding causes. According to doctrine it should be included in dharma-svarūpa etc. Why call it a separate fault? Additionally the commentary says: "If stating causal words, they must be substantial." Thus knowing: Dignāga and others' minds do not further permit substantial lacking. This is because they establish this fault in the three characteristics of causes. If so, this doctrine is not yet detailed. How can one respond?

Answer: Lacking similar analogies: first, faults of ability-to-establish should not exceed the thirty-three faults. This principle is

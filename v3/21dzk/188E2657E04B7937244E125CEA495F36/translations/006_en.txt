What is stated is that the reasoning is still not clear. First, how do we know that under the explicit statement of "existence" there is additionally an intended meaning additional-word inference? Generally, those who maintain the original method doctrine say that under the subject "existence," there are intended meanings of "creating universal existence perceiving nature" and "creating non-universal existence perceiving nature," and by saying "non-substantial, etc.," they do not exclusively establish the doctrine of creating universal existence perceiving nature, and do not claim there is an intended meaning additional-word inference. Next, regarding the three inferences established by the sage, although he says "existence" generally and places his words in mutual acceptance, when the predicate says "non-substantial," he exclusively establishes universal existence nature, limiting it only to the single doctrine of having object-perceiving nature, not carrying the intended meaning of having non-object-perceiving nature. What replacement is there to accept and examine faults? Next, reconciling the treatise text is not the commentary's intention. Explaining the text of "both equally determined" as "blocking non-substantiality, etc., and having object-perceiving nature" means that using the reason "having one substance, etc.," one establishes both theses "existence is non-substantial" and "existence has object-perceiving nature." Both are explicit statements, not intended meanings. Therefore, when the commentary says "and has object-perceiving nature," it is the predicate of the present inference. The text "also can establish" should still be in relation to "the explicit statement of having object-perceiving nature." However, regarding the text "like blocking substance, etc.," those who maintain separate method doctrine have further reconciliation. Namely, the previous subject-svarūpa uses negation words for both contradicted and contradicting. The present subject-differentia contradiction has the contradicted establish "existence has object-perceiving nature," already without negation words, and the contradicting says "not creating universal existence perceiving nature," having negation words. Therefore, to establish the meaning of negation, one should follow the previous inference, not for the present method. Next, reconciling the text "this word 'existence'" - that reasoning is not detailed. Generally, when the master establishes three inferences, in the explicit statement of existence, he additionally carries the intended meaning of having object-perceiving nature. Now, to reveal this desired position, he separately

establishes the inference "existence has object-perceiving nature." Therefore, discussing it in relation to the original, he says "immediately in the previous thesis, subject-differentia." This is the explicit statement of this inference. Therefore, he troublesomely avoids faults. If it were intended meaning, why would he forcefully use mutually accepted words? For example, like the intended meaning "non-aggregated other-use" in dharma-differentia contradiction, etc. Then shall I answer in detail this time? Answer: First, that the explicit statement of existence carries intended meaning additional-word inferences is not the establisher's private opinion. Previous masters from ancient times have all discussed this. Generally, in the latter three contradictions, the establisher's desired position is not revealed in explicit statement; all have intended meaning additional-word inferences. Namely, dharma-differentia contradiction's "non-aggregated other-use," subject-svarūpa's "existence apart from substance, etc.," and subject-differentia's "having object-perceiving nature." Among these, regarding subject-differentia contradiction, the Duan states: "If based on intended meaning, establish 'existence has object-perceiving nature,'" and in the Mingdeng Commentary it says: "This is placing within one type of explicit statement inference thesis and deceptively establishing an intended meaning second type thesis, accomplishing both such types of theses within one inference, therefore called committing contradiction." The explicit statement inference is the thesis "existence is non-substantial, etc." The second type thesis is the inference "existence has object-perceiving nature." Therefore, having intended meaning inference is definitively established. Now this inference "existence has object-perceiving nature" is not the method for subject-differentia contradiction. The reason is that under the predicate "having object-perceiving nature," there are two intended meanings: "creating universal existence perceiving nature" and "creating non-universal existence perceiving nature," and using the reason "having one substance, etc.," one establishes contradictory doctrines. This is called dharma-differentia contradiction. Therefore, the Duan refutes Master Pi: "Within having object-perceiving nature, the intention is creating universal existence perceiving nature and creating non-universal existence perceiving nature - these are the differentia." Therefore, in relation to the explicit statement non-additional-word inference, when saying "existence

is non-substantial," in the subject "existence" there are two intended meanings. "Having object-perceiving nature" is the predicate of intended meaning inference. Horizontally relating to intended meaning, this is called dharma-differentia. Vertically in relation to explicit statement, this is called subject-differentia. Therefore, now relating to non-additional-word explicit statement inference, it becomes the method for subject-differentia contradiction. Therefore, the Duan also states: "In relation to non-additional-word it is called subject-differentia; if additional words are added, it is immediately called dharma." Contradictions in various texts should be reconciled according to this. Then, the commentary text "this word 'existence' is existence of existence-nonexistence" should be considered by retaining the text. Like that dharma-differentia contradiction, this is one reason violating one method. When establishing the explicit statement "necessarily for other-use," because the word "other" in the predicate expresses the desired thesis, without blocking faults, the intended meaning is "non-aggregated other-use." Now this inference "existence is non-substantial" is one reason violating two methods. Among these, first the subject-svarūpa: when establishing the explicit statement "existence is non-substantial, etc.," it also expresses the desired thesis. Therefore, in intended meaning also without blocking faults, the intended meaning is "existence apart from substance, etc., universal existence." Next, this subject-differentia: the explicit statement has not yet expressed the desired position and does not reach disputing the differentia doctrine. Therefore, first establish "existence has object-perceiving nature," then should accomplish the desired "creating universal existence perceiving nature." Therefore, simultaneously avoiding faults like predicate non-establishment, etc., the intended meaning is "having object-perceiving nature." Because this inference must necessarily be established against opponent debaters. Therefore, although an intended meaning inference, it still uses mutually accepted words. Do not compare it to dharma-differentia, etc. Its doctrine is profound and should be well considered.

Repeatedly asking: If so, is it double intended meaning? When establishing "existence is non-substantial," the intended meaning is "having object-perceiving nature," and also under "having object-perceiving nature," the intended meaning is "creating universal existence perceiving nature."

【Lower Section】
Answer: What reasoning indicates is indeed double intended meaning. Therefore, the Duan states: "Within having object-perceiving nature, the intention is creating universal existence perceiving nature." However, the master's intended meaning is not double. "Having object-perceiving nature" is immediately "creating universal existence perceiving nature." For example, in dharma-differentia contradiction, when establishing "necessarily for other-use," the word "other" is immediately "non-aggregated other."

Also asking: The Duan states "However, establishing this dharma, the intention establishes the subject, etc." - does this mean using the inference "existence has object-perceiving nature" as the method for subject-differentia contradiction? Answer: No. Although it is an additional-word inference, it still establishes the subject, not the same as the sound-impermanence inference only establishing dharma-svarūpa. It does not say it becomes a subject-differentia contradiction method.

Also asking: Does Zhou's Commentary's correct doctrine separately establish the inference "existence has object-perceiving nature" and say it should be the subject-differentia contradiction method? Answer: No. Separately establishing intended meaning additional-word inference should reveal the differentia doctrine. It is like saying there are two intended meanings under the explicit statement of "having object-perceiving nature." This is dharma-differentia. It does not say it becomes a subject-differentia contradiction method. By this one can grasp the text's meaning.

Following the recommendation of a knowing friend, I humbly leave this foolish proposal.

Question: The Duan states: "Now based on intended meaning, challenging to establish faults, therefore not explicit statement." Is that intended meaning the intended meaning of "having object-perceiving nature" or the intended meaning of "creating universal existence perceiving nature"? Answer: Having object-perceiving

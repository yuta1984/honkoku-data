Question: Regarding the Zuanyo's text "does not correspond to the accepted existence," is it the second or fifth among the nine propositions?
Answer: It is the second proposition.

The above recorded in the presence of Dharma Master Ekyō on Ninpei third year, tenth month, twentieth day.

Question: Regarding the dharma-differentia contradicting inference, is its intended meaning superior-inferior?
Answer: That is correct.

Question: If so, when creating the contradicting inference "provisional-other usage is superior," the intended meaning "divine-self usage is superior, provisional-self usage is inferior" is both negated. This contradicts the text "replacing the provisional-other," etc. How should this be reconciled?
Answer: When creating the contradicting inference "provisional-other usage is superior," although provisional-other usage being inferior is negated, it is the character "inferior" that is negated. The intended meaning of provisional usage still remains without losing the explicit statement. Therefore the Zuanyo states: "provisional-other usage exists without contradicting the explicit statement," etc. It also states: "if one explains accumulated others, it commits the fault of accordance." Master Eichō used this as proof of the superior-inferior intended meaning.

Question: What difficulty is there with the superior-superior intended meaning?
Answer: The original intention of the Sāṅkhya's established inference is to establish the divine self. It does not dispute superior-inferior. Therefore, following the original intention, it establishes "divine-self usage is superior, provisional-self usage is inferior." But taking "provisional-self usage is superior" as a one-sided differentia is not the establisher's original intention. Provisional-self usage is not desired. "Superior" is redundant. It also contradicts the text "superior-inferior differentia."

Question: Regarding the "superior-inferior differentia" text, the Sanke school explains this as one-sided differentia. How should this be reconciled?
Answer: This explanation has the greatest difficulty. If divine-self usage being superior accompanies provisional-self usage being inferior, then provisional-self usage being superior should also accompany divine-self usage being inferior. If so, when Buddhism establishes "provisional usage is superior," it should also accompany divine-self usage being inferior. That would be laughable.

Question: (Regarding dharma-svarūpa) What about the text "does not correspond to accepted existence"?
Answer: It should be like the Yellow Private Record, Sanshō tradition.

Question: Is there difficulty with the doctrine of name-meaning non-accordance regarding "the reason also does not pervade"?
Answer: It should be explained in accordance with your doctrine. The Dharma Master does not find it difficult.

The above recorded in the presence of the Dharma Master on Ninpei third year, tenth month, twenty-second day.

Question: What about the non-separation nature of subject-svarūpa?
Answer: If based on explicit statement, "non-substantiality of existence" is taken as non-separation nature.
If based on intended meaning, "existence apart from substance of existence" is taken as non-separation nature.

Question: What about the predicate of the general thesis?
Answer: The predicate of non-separation nature is called the predicate of the general thesis. What is based on explicit statement is non-substantiality. What is based on intended meaning is existence apart from substance.

The above recorded in the presence of the Dharma Master on Ninpei fourth year, second month, twenty-fifth day.

Question: Does the Duan's text "thus establishing this dharma," etc., take the inference "existence creating existence-conditional nature" as a subject-differentia inference?

Answer: Kojima's intention is like this. However, this tradition is not acceptable. The inference "existence creating existence-conditional nature" is simply an inference that establishes the subject. The inference "sound is impermanent" is an inference that establishes the dharma—this is what is meant, not that the inference "existence creating existence-conditional nature" is subject-differentia.

After Kyūju first year, twelfth month, seventeenth day. Dharma Master Ekyō teaches Buddhist logic.

○ Establishment and opposition in dharma-svarūpa
Because the thesis "sound is impermanent" does not obstruct Buddhist disciples, various texts pose no difficulty.
Regarding avoiding contradictory determinants, one should rely on the Sanshō Private Record. Also, an old private record states:
"Now, among the nine propositions, the sound theorists have no inference establishing the thesis 'sound is eternal' using the reason 'because it is audible' and the positive analogy 'sound-nature.' Therefore there is no fault of determinant contradiction." Also, the Nine Propositions Meaning Private Record states: "Question: Then the sound theorists also again use the reason 'audible nature' and positive analogy 'sound-nature' as the second proposition, creating contradictory determinants. What can be prevented? Answer: Among those nine propositions, there are no contradictory determinants. Those that have contradictory determinants outside the nine propositions are not prevented."
Therefore we know this is a doctrine much used by ancient worthy predecessors.

Regarding the correctness of contradictory determinants:
Contradictory determinants are not included within the nine propositions. Therefore the Zuanyao states: "However, these nine propositions are narrower than Dignāga's, lacking the fault of contradictory determinants."
When the sound and Vaiśeṣika masters confront each other outside the nine propositions, although there are contradictory determinants, ultimately the Vaiśeṣika...

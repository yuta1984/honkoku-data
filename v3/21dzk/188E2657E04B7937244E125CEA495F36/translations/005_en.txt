When establishing an inference through explicit statement in this way, it is for the sake of dharma-svarūpa. Therefore, the following text states: "If additional words are added, it is immediately called dharma." Question: If so, what difference is there from Master Pi's doctrine? Answer: Master Pi establishes the subject-svabhāva as existence apart from substance, and examines positive and negative analogies in relation to this. The master of the Duan says that although dispute arises from the dharma-thesis of non-substantiality, the existence apart from substance derived from that non-substantial statement exists in the subject position. How could there be no difference? The above text of the Duan states: "Therefore we know that taking non-substantiality, etc. as dharma is precisely what is disputed." This is also the same intention.

Question: What text serves as proof that existence apart from substance exists in the subject position?
Answer: The commentary states: "Existence already becomes subject-svarūpa," etc. It also states: "Although challenging intended meaning existence apart from substance, etc., it is not existence," etc. These are the proof texts.

○ Subject-differentia (Copying and recording the Master's notes)
Question: What is the method for subject-differentia contradiction? Answer: Regarding the method for subject-differentia contradiction, there are two traditions among previous masters. One takes the previous subject-svarūpa method as the present subject-differentia contradiction method. Namely, Master Vaiśeṣika establishes an inference against his disciple Pañcaśikha: "Existence is non-substantial, non-qualitative, non-active, because it has one substance, because it has qualities and actions, like identity-difference nature." This is that method. Alternatively, in the previous three inferences of "existence is non-substantial," etc., one changes the predicate dharma-thesis and establishes "existence as having object-perceiving nature." Making this the method - the intention of previous masters may also have this.

Question: Regarding the method for subject-differentia contradiction, since previous masters already have two traditions, what doctrine does the establisher maintain? Answer: The method for subject-differentia contradiction has been undecided since ancient times.

【Lower Section】
Therefore recent previous masters said: "Among the four types of contradictions, there is no such difficulty anywhere." Since predecessors have already left doubts, how can later students decide it? However, the eminent virtue of the seven great temples and students from ancient times to the present mostly rely on the tradition of the original method. Therefore, one should temporarily maintain this doctrine.

Question: Among the two traditions, maintaining the original method doctrine is unreasonable. Generally, in differentia contradiction inferences, explicit statement svarūpa is mutually accepted by both establisher and opponent, and the intended meaning thesis includes two equal doctrines. However, the previous subject-svarūpa method has the contradicted establishing "existence is non-substantial," limiting the subject existence to universal existence. The contradicting challenges "existence is non-existence," destroying the explicit statement svarūpa. How does this include two equal doctrines to become a differentia contradiction method? Therefore, establishing the separate inference "existence has object-perceiving nature," when both subject and predicate are mutually accepted, examining the two intended meanings should be this method. Moreover, seeing the treatise text: "Like this very reason, in the previous thesis, subject-differentia has object-perceiving nature." The so-called "having object-perceiving nature" is the predicate dharma-thesis. Based on this, the next explanation of contradicting method states: "It can also establish the contradictory 'having non-object-perceiving nature.'" If the explicit statement of "having object-perceiving nature" is not established, in relation to what would one say "also can establish the contradictory," etc.? Then the commentary explains the treatise text: "This word 'existence' is the existence of existence-nonexistence, not the existence that creates objects and causes, having perceiving nature therefore not universal existence. If creating universal existence perceiving nature, the predicate would not be established." By this we know that establishing the separate inference "existence has object-perceiving nature" should be the present method. Then why go against textual principle and maintain the original method

tradition? Answer: First, the method for subject-differentia contradiction is generally when Master Vaiśeṣika faces his disciple Pañcaśikha, examining the seven qualities' capacities and transmitting the profound meaning of six categories, the master and student dispute. This concerns universal existence apart from substance, etc. However, within the study room, one does not establish double inferences; before the window, one simply shows one complete method. Namely, the three inferences of "existence is non-substantial," etc. Now under the explicit statement of this "existence," it carries two intended meaning additional-word inferences. First, establishing "existence apart from substance, etc." accomplishes the substance of existence. Second, establishing "existence has object-perceiving nature" disputes the meaning of existence. This is precisely what the master originally intended to establish. Therefore, when saying "existence" in explicit statement, it necessarily carries the intended meaning of apart-from-substance, etc., as the desired thesis. However, the positive analogy identity-difference nature is already not apart-from-substance universal existence. In relation to the intended meaning thesis, it conversely becomes a negative analogy. By this, the intended meaning universal existence is negated, and the explicit statement existence also perishes. Both surface and depth are completely destroyed. This is called "existence svarūpa contradiction." Next, examining the master's intended meaning: just as identity-difference nature, having one substance, etc., has object-perceiving nature while its substance is not substance, etc., existence also has one substance and also has object-perceiving nature. Therefore we know its substance is not substance, etc. By this, under the explicit statement of existence, it also includes the separate meaning of having object-perceiving nature as the desired thesis. Therefore the commentary states: "That Kapila sage, because Pañcaśikha does not believe in existence separate from substance, quality, and action, immediately uses the previous reason to establish the previous thesis - explicit statement existence subject-svarūpa intended meaning differentia as having perceiving nature." However, the positive analogy identity-difference nature becomes identity-difference's object-perceiving nature, not universal existence's object-perceiving nature. In relation to the intended meaning thesis, it also divides into negative analogy. By this, the explicit statement of existence does not perish, but the intended meaning separate doctrine contradicts. Therefore it is called "subject-differentia contradiction"

Thus this inference immediately violates two methods with one reason. Namely, using the statement of non-substantiality, one sees that subject existence is apart-from-substance universal existence, and based on this challenges "existence is non-existence." This is the subject-svarūpa method. Also, saying "existence" generally without saying "universal existence," accepting this and examining two intended meanings is the present subject-differentia. Through concession and examination of faults, adding single and double challenges. Therefore, both attach to the latter two phase-faults, with no further contradictions. However, regarding treatise and commentary texts: first, when the treatise says "subject-differentia having object-perceiving nature," it is intended meaning differentia under existence explicit statement. If following the master's intention, it immediately creates universal existence perceiving nature. It is not explicit statement's having object-perceiving nature. Next, "also can establish having non-object-perceiving nature" - the treatise's following text explains the reason: "Like blocking substance, etc., both are equally determined." This means: now using the reason "having one substance, etc." to establish the thesis "existence is non-substantial, etc.," and afterward also establishing the intended meaning having object-perceiving nature. When the opponent examines contradictions, also using this reason to establish non-having object-perceiving nature. In relation to those non-substantial, etc. statements, it says "also can establish." It does not place the word "also" in relation to the explicit statement of having object-perceiving nature. Therefore the Duan states: "The treatise says 'like blocking substance, etc., both are equally determined,' not saying 'establishing having object-perceiving nature also gains determinacy.'" Next, the commentary saying "this word 'existence' is existence of existence-nonexistence, etc." should be understood according to the previous. The treatise saying "having object-perceiving nature" is the predicate of intended meaning inference. Since "existence has object-perceiving nature" should be established, it temporarily abbreviates the word "universal" to mean intended meaning having object-perceiving nature. The reason for this is that if revealing the desired position, it must be established through explicit statement. By this it simultaneously avoids faults like predicate non-establishment, etc., saying intended meaning having object-perceiving nature. Question: What is answered

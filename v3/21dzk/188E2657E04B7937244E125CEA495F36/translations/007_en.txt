It is the intended meaning of "nature." It says that the treatise's "creating object-perceiving nature" is intended meaning.

Master Matsumuro says: "Now this creating object-perceiving nature ○ this is that differentia" 《Above, Master Pi has already been refuted》 "Now based on intended meaning ○ therefore not explicit statement" 《The master of Duan presents the correct doctrine》 In question and answer, based on intended meaning, establish and say "existence creates perceiving, etc." 《The master of Duan questions himself》

○ Contradictory Reason 《Reason of one's own doctrine》
I (Secret) also, like the text on the four contradictory reasons in logic, make this proof for the "reason as such." The commentary says "Now stating this thesis, there is not yet any fault" 《etc.》 If so, even if one establishes the doctrine that contradiction is identical with reason, what thesis-reason mutual comparison difficulty would there be?

Answer: The text "Now stating this thesis, etc." means that because the thesis "sound is permanent" is entirely impermanent 《reason》, this reason is badly established and has many faults. Because the thesis has no fault, it says "Now stating this thesis, there is not yet any fault; only when raising the reason is there fault" etc. It is not because the thesis becomes faulty due to thesis and reason being mutually comparative with only the reason having faults. One should not use as example the made-reason violating the permanence thesis.

The Monastic Director says: In the Pivotal Essentials and the Ten Reasons Chapter, there are matters of pure contradictory reason-effect and uncontaminated affairs. This should be used as a difficulty for the "reason as such." 《There is no one who knows this matter》

There is a question about "reason reversing thesis." This asks based on the doctrine of "reason as such." 《One should read the punctuation marks》

When there is using reason to make the thesis reverse, if a reason not conforming to reason-nature is called contradictory, then when the thesis also makes the reason reverse, the reason not conforming to thesis-nature should be called contradictory.

In the commentary's style, when the thesis violates the reason it is called "violation," when both theses are discordant and reversed it is called "reversal." Therefore one should not read "reason reversal" as "not reversing to the thesis."

Also, naming a reason "dharma-svarūpa contradiction" means that the made-reason makes the permanence thesis reverse, becoming a reason for the impermanence thesis, which is named dharma-svarūpa contradiction.

Naming the thesis "inference contradiction" means that the permanence thesis violating the reason of the impermanence thesis is named inference contradiction. 《The previous thesis and later reason are mutually opposed; the thesis is named inference contradiction, the reason is named dharma-svarūpa contradiction. This reasoning is appropriate》

The treatise states: "Also can establish what contradicts this - creating non-object-perceiving nature" 《etc.》 This text should serve as proof for the "reason as such."

Question: Should those who maintain the doctrine of "reason as such" abandon the Yi Commentary? Answer: They should abandon it.

○ Like Having No Violating Dharma 《In one's own doctrine, the original inference has not yet suffered other-violation. This is the Yi Commentary's intention》
The Treatise on Logic's text "If there is no violated harm" serves as proof for this doctrine.

○ Do Inference Contradiction, Contradictory Determination, and Contradictory Reason Coexist? 《In one's own doctrine, they coexist》
For what is contradicted: three faults coexist. 《Inference contradiction and contradictory reason coexist without changing the reason. Contradictory determination coexists by changing the reason》
For what contradicts: contradictory reason and inference contradiction coexist. Contradictory determination does not coexist.

Question: The commentary says "All contradictory determinations are inference contradictions" 《etc.》 Why does the treatise's contradictory determination carry inference contradiction? Because inference contradiction violates the principle of correct inference.

Answer: Because the audible-nature reason possesses the three characteristics, it is tentatively called a correct inference reason. Therefore it says "All contradictory determinations are inference contradictions" 《etc.》 《Master Myōsen says: At the place of contradictory determination: "Two inference contradictions also penetrate contradictory determination, like the sixth contradictory determination"》 《Namely, the previous impermanence thesis violates the later audible-nature. This is called inference contradiction》

○ Limited-Universal Opposition 《Copying and recording the Monastic Director's record》
I say privately: Secretly observing the textual momentum of the commentary and judgment, this present limited-universal opposition should be doctrinally separate from the substance-attribute opposition taught in inner enlightenment teachings. The proposals of Masters Dōsen, Ninkaku, etc. deeply probe the subtle principle. The reason is that the substance-attribute opposition taught in inner teachings calls the five aggregates' own substance "inherent nature" and names the self, impermanence, etc. upon that substance "differentia." This principle is necessary, having no confusion from the beginning. However, seeing the commentary text's aspect, it says "established inherent nature" and already produces two types: self and dharma. If this were inner teaching's substance-attribute opposition, would this take self as inherent nature? Moreover, seeing the judgment text, in the Buddha-Ground Sutra's svarūpa-sāmānya and the logical treatise's svarūpa-sāmānya, among the three types of differentia produced, the third differentia distinguishes using this present limited-universal opposition. Therefore the text says "Third, logic's two aspects are divided according to universal-limited; using later teachings necessarily penetrating others" 《etc.》 Therefore this opposition's intention: whether five aggregates' inherent nature or impermanence etc. differentia, what is limited-attached to inherent nature is called inherent nature; what penetrates-through others is called differentia. It is not like inner teaching's substance-attribute opposition where inherent nature and differentia are solidly fixed each to each. This present one is unfixed. If not so, when establishing "self is thought," would this take the subject "self" as differentia and the predicate-thesis "thought" as inherent nature? If one permits this, it contradicts the text "calling self inherent nature." That

doctrine is necessary. Also it violates the judgment that in limited-universal opposition "what later-taught penetrates others' surface is differentia." Because it judges later-taught thought as inherent nature. Based on this, the judgment says: "However, substance is unfixed; though sutras universally penetrate and discriminate, because the two aspects of pervading/non-pervading are immediately fixed, there are differentia" 《etc.》 Thus we know that this present limited-universal opposition has unfixed doctrine. The meaning "however, substance is unfixed" presumably lies in this. Common scholars cling to their substances being identical, not yet being detailed about doctrinal principle. Regarding previous masters' doctrines judging them identical, they do not yet know their intention. Moreover, the Bright Lamp Commentary, First Volume,献 Commentary, etc. have clear evidence and should not be doubted.

Repeatedly challenging: Judging the inner teaching's substance-attribute opposition as separate is entirely unreasonable in principle. Examining the three levels of inherent nature-differentia: the first opposition generally judges established dharma's inherent nature-differentia. The second level is properly the inference-establishment gate. In this present opposition, not discussing various dharmas' substance-attribute, the prior statement becomes inherent nature, the later statement becomes differentia. Therefore, seeing the commentary text, reaching the second prior-statement later-statement opposition, it produces the doctrine of unfixed naming. One does not specifically see that doctrine being unfixed in the initial opposition. If so, what differentia would there be between the second and first oppositions? Not discussing substance-attribute, naming being unfixed. However, regarding the Sāṅkhya-established inference "self is thought," originally this present first level does not relate to the inference-establishment gate but generally produces inherent nature-differentia. Like the Four-Volume Private Commentary, also Kojima says: "Question: Why is the sequence of these three oppositions so? Answer: The first level generally relates to dharmas established by the logical gate; the second level clarifies the inference-establishment gate" 《etc.》 Therefore, regarding inference-establishment, one should not raise doubts. Moreover

That is not so. Generally in Buddhist logic dharma, the faults of ability-to-establish have seven types in total. Namely: lacking-diminishing fault-nature, thesis-establishing fault-nature, non-accomplishing cause-nature, indeterminate cause-nature, contradictory cause-nature, similar-analogy fault-nature, and dissimilar-analogy fault-nature. The first lacking-diminishing fault-nature encompasses both substantial and insubstantial. Substantial means stating words. This is precisely faults on the component. Insubstantial means not stating words. This is precisely faults where components are lacking. Now the thirty-three faults are all faults on components. Therefore, regarding substantial lacking, along with other fault-characteristics, regarding insubstantial lacking, they are not included in the thirty-three faults. Regarding these lacking faults, Dignāga Bodhisattva only established six sentences, not establishing the seventh "all three characteristics lacking together." The scholars of the five regions are unwilling to accept this. However, at Nālandā monastery there was one great treatise master named Bhadanta. He had wonderful enlightenment regarding Buddhist logic and deep mastery of different theories. In Buddhist logic treatises, at times there were no opponents. This was precisely the teacher of Buddhist logic for Treatise Master Śūramati. He also, like Dignāga, did not establish the seventh. The other various masters dare not believe this. Therefore lacking similar analogies means precisely the fault of lacking the similar-analogy component. This is one among the six sentences. It is only named lacking-diminishing fault-nature and is not included in the thirty-three faults. Due to this, the treatise says: "Furthermore, if correctly manifesting the faults of ability-to-establish is called ability-to-refute, namely the initial ability-to-establish's lacking-diminishing fault-nature, thesis-establishing fault-nature, non-accomplishing cause-nature, indeterminate cause-nature, contradictory cause-nature, and analogy fault-nature"《etc.》. Already establishing lacking-diminishing fault-nature separately outside the three-component faults. Why would there be no separate substance outside the thirty-three faults? Due to this, the commentary explains this text, raising both substantial and insubstantial two types together. The insubstantial lacking is exclusively not included in the thirty-three faults. Therefore the commentary says: "Only named lacking fault, not included in other faults"《etc.》. However, after Dignāga, establishing lacking-diminishing fault-nature in the three characteristics of causes means: now "one cause, two analogies" - this is precisely the three characteristics of causes. Using the three characteristics of causes to encompass similar and dissimilar analogies, making such explanations. This is not limited only to causes.《Note: The original guide says: After my humble examination of the commentary: After Dignāga, immediately explaining the three characteristics of causes immediately encompasses the two analogies. The two analogies and causes together manifest the thesis.》If only limited to causes, not similar-dissimilar analogies, and also only substantial, not encompassing insubstantial, then why in the commentary's text above: "Treatise Master Bhadanta, Bodhisattva Dignāga and others take insubstantial as lacking, therefore only six sentences"《etc.》. Thus we know: The minds of Dignāga, Bhadanta and others still permit insubstantial lacking. They only do not permit the seventh sentence. However, regarding "also like the treatise explains etc. text": if in establishing causes, this is then substantial lacking. Because lacking the made-cause. If in similar analogies, this is then component-lacking fault. Only named insubstantial lacking's lacking-diminishing fault-nature. Therefore, establishing this fault in "one cause, two analogies," so not only establishing causes. If in similar analogies, temporarily establishing insubstantial, therefore immediately called "lacking similar analogies." Therefore the commentary's text above says: "Bodhisattva Dignāga takes predicate non-establishment as precisely faults of uncommon indeterminacy etc. in causes, also these are thesis non-establishment in analogies, lacking similar analogies etc."《etc.》. Already saying "also these are in analogies." Therefore we know it is not only establishing causes. Therefore there is no such fault.

○ The aggregate-nature cause violates dharma-svarūpa《etc.》
When the Sāṅkhya master, opposing Buddhist disciples, establishes the inference saying "Eyes etc. must serve my use, because of aggregate-nature, like bedding etc.," already having other's predicate non-establishment, seeing other schools, bedding is not an object of spirit-self's reception and use. Therefore it becomes a dissimilar analogy. Therefore lacking the latter two characteristics, causing violation of the dharma-svarūpa of "must serve other's use." As saying "also like the treatise explains"《Note: The original back-writing says: The matter of being exemplified by "also like the treatise explains etc. text"》"The sound-permanence thesis dharma-svarūpa cause, opposing the void-school, lacks similar analogies."

○ The "must serve other's use" inference commits the fault of accordant thesis
　This inference is a differential inference. The proponent's intention considers it establishing spirit-self. Therefore it does not commit accordance.

○ Because the dharma of causes and analogies should not be differentiated, therefore establishing them comprehensively
Question: First, in Buddhist logic dharma, the principle of generally not differentiating the dharma of causes and analogies is not reasonable. In the Śataśāstra, they further differentiate these. Namely, what Sāṅkhya establishes: consciousness-wisdom is not deliberation, differentiating causal meanings. Then examining faults saying: "Regarding birth-destruction meaning, one's own school does not permit; regarding hidden-manifest meaning explanation, other schools do not accomplish"《text》. Now Treatise Master Dharmapāla further applies this differentiation. How could this not be the standard of Buddhist logic? Additionally, in the Vijñānavāda Essentials, examining the faults of Bhāviveka's inference, also differentiating the like-illusion analogy. Thereby attributing ability-to-establish and what-is-to-be-established two types of non-establishment. Therefore, Dharmapāla extensively refutes Sāṅkhya, the Madhyamaka school further criticizes the extremist master, all differentiating cause-analogy dharmas to examine inference faults. Thus we know: The mind of the Buddhist logic school should still differentiate these.

Answer: Generally the intention of the Buddhist logic school only relies on general-characteristic extreme establishment, having no regard for hypothetical differentiation. If looking toward proponent and opponent, forcibly seeking separate meanings, with what would one establish true doctrine? With what would one refute erroneous doctrines? However, regarding the Śataśāstra explanation, the predecessor virtuous ones have two transmissions. Either for investigating and seeking students' wise understanding, hypothetically differentiating these. This is not exhaustive explanation of principle. Or the ancient masters before Dignāga relied on separate meanings to examine faults. From Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva onwards, regarding general characteristics, they then establish inferences. Therefore the Śataśāstra explanation temporarily accords with ancient masters. Like the Nyāyamukha explaining thesis as ability-to-establish, they take thesis as ability-to-establish, temporarily to accord with ancient masters. Now applying differentiation to causes - how could this be Dharmapāla's original intention? Speaking from true principle, also should not differentiate. Therefore the compilation says: "If so, when Sāṅkhya, opposing Buddhist disciples, establishes consciousness-wisdom as non-thought, using the cause 'because of impermanence,' also not differentiating. Answer: also should not differentiate. Only disputing whether consciousness-wisdom is thought or non-thought"《text》. Next, regarding Bhāviveka's inference like-illusion analogy, this also has two transmissions. If following some ancient virtuous one's mind, this is also hypothetical differentiation. Furthermore not real fault. If following Master Pingbei's mind, this is not differentiating similar analogies. Only manifesting obvious faults. Namely: generally that the dharma of causes and analogies should not be differentiated is discussed regarding inferences that have analogy-substance. However, if apparent-phenomenon illusion, looking toward the Void school there is no analogy-substance. If real-phenomenon illusion, looking toward dependent-origination there is no analogy-substance. Ability-to-establish and what-is-to-be-established mutually lack, thesis-similarity and cause-similarity not complete. This fault is obvious. Furthermore not differentiated. Therefore with these and other inferences, further do not make difficulties.

Question: Between the great virtue's transmission and Pingbei's transmission, which should be used? Answer: The Monastic Director says: Pingbei's doctrine should be used.

○ How could there be no matter of capable reception and use regarding eyes etc.《The intention of the Bright Lamp Commentary should be preserved.》
Question: Generally seeing the tendency of the commentary text, above it describes the Western Region master's counter-rescue. Already examining Sāṅkhya's fundamental calculation, saying

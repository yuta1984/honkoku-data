The Commentary, volume 4-1, says: "So-called recitation and memorization need not necessarily be extensive. The path values obtaining the essential, yet spiritual function has no fixed standard and varies in strength. Some people recite extremely much but do not understand the meaning. This is because they are slow and dull in entering the path. Therefore the Nirvana Sutra says: 'Better to understand much of the essential meaning through little hearing. The Buddha-dharma values practicing according to what is taught, not valuing much reading and recitation.'" Knowing it is thus, following what the ancient worthies indicated: "Reciting the one volume of the Śrīmālā encompasses all the fundamentals of Buddha-dharma" 《marginal note: The one volume of Tathāgatagarbha has the same purport - recite according to convenience》. "Reciting one volume of the precept text encompasses all restraint practices. Reciting one volume of the Karma text encompasses all performance dharmas. Because the path has fundamentals and practices are divided into restraint and performance." Reciting these three volumes comprehensively encompasses the essential principles of Buddha-dharma. The other great scripture collections must be extensively read, having the advantage of broad knowledge, also supporting mental cultivation and assisting spiritual practice without becoming negligent. Up to additionally long periods of sitting meditation, questioning meanings, requesting explanations, seeking differences, etc. If one extensively opens and explains many meanings, this is not what is being discussed here. Those who know from birth are superior. The Three Thousand威儀 says: "The śramaṇa's duties are sutra recitation, sitting meditation, and encouraging transformation of various matters. If one does not practice these, one is born and dies in vain." Up to the Buddha Treasury [Sutra]: "Before five summers, one should depend on others to receive and study the Vinaya collection. After five summers, having complete knowledge, one should study the no-self person-dharma," and so forth. Also, the novice section of the Commentary and the Karma Commentary 2-2 extensively list the three practices, clarifying that much learning, precepts, and concentration are all aids to the path. If grasped, they become golden chains instead. Only the wisdom that contemplates the Four Noble Truths and no-self is the correct practice of monastics - this should be investigated. Also, in the Pure Mind Sincere Contemplation, this principle is earnestly and repeatedly taught, as can be seen.

In the Tang dynasty era, there were already the problems of scholarly discussions and doctrinal studies, but the problems of grasping characteristics and maintaining discipline were

not yet numerous. After the Song dynasty, both types of problematic tendencies arose together. It is unclear whether Nanshan foresaw future problems and left this sincere contemplation.

Fourth, clarifying that gradual entry into the secret treasury is the correct track of Śākyamuni's one teaching transformation, to admonish those who are hasty in learning stages: Generally, all sentient beings' realms possess both the meanings of transmigration and cessation-return, but transmigration's arising necessarily has sequence. Like the analogy of knots - through grasping external objects with the mind, dharma-attachment and discrimination arise; due to dharma-attachment, self-attachment arises; due to self-attachment, the three paths of birth-death cycle endlessly. Therefore, removing obstructions and cessation-return also naturally have sequence. First cut off self-attachment, then cut off dharma-attachment, like untying knots. This is the natural principle. For example, one bright pearl wrapped in three layers - first wrapped with silk, then stored in a wooden box, then placed in an iron case. When opening, one must first open the iron case, then the wooden box, then the silk. Following this sequence, after opening, the pearl's essence finally appears. The Tripiṭaka teachings counter self-attachment afflictive obstructions, causing departure from the deluded bondage of the three realms of birth-death - like opening the iron case. The dharma-gates of two-emptiness vijñānavāda counter the coarse aspects of two attachments and two obstructions - like opening the wooden box. The teaching dharmas of Tathāgatagarbha dependent origination purify the subtle aspects of two attachments and two obstructions in the secret treasury - like opening the silk. Generally, bodhisattvas have two types: first, direct advancement; second, turning the mind. The so-called direct advancement means directly cultivating and entering through the middle way of two-emptiness vijñānavāda. The so-called turning the mind means initially depending on the teaching of person-emptiness to enter the path of seeing, up to obtaining the no-learning fruit and then turning toward the Mahāyāna. However, sentient beings of the turbid world of Jambudvīpa have thick and heavy views and craving, like iron

cases. Therefore it is not suitable to directly cultivate and study the Mahāyāna path. Hence, first through śrāvaka dharma-teaching, one obtains person-emptiness wisdom, enters the unconditioned realm, and afterward advances to enter supreme Mahāyāna realization. This is the correct track of Jambudvīpa's one teaching transformation. Therefore, the cultivation and realization of mind-turning bodhisattvas is as described above. Though there are direct-advancement capacities, their preparatory cultivation must be the same as the śrāvaka three studies, damaging and subduing present afflictions to develop their concern. If the mind-ground is not yet purified and one mistakenly studies profound Mahāyāna dharmas, the buddhas are not pleased. A seven-day infant cannot digest fine food; how can a vulgar person of accumulated lifetimes ride a precious carriage? The Daśacakra Sūtra says: "Good son, if sentient beings have not made diligent effort and correct earnest cultivation in śrāvaka and pratyekabuddhayāna dharmas, such sentient beings have inferior faculties and little vigor. If someone explains the subtle, profound Mahāyāna true dharma, both speaker and listener obtain great sin." Up to "All such sentient beings' faults arise from not learning śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha vehicle dharmas and first entering the Mahāyāna." The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Universal Learning chapter says: "Subhūti, if one does not universally study śrāvakayāna and pratyekabuddhayāna dharmas, one cannot obtain the bodhisattva path of seeing." The Buddha Treasury Sutra says: "Not first learning the Lesser Vehicle and then learning the Mahāyāna - such are not Buddha's disciples." Also, numerous analogies in the earlier portion of the Nirvana Sutra all demonstrate the principle of gradually entering the Mahāyāna. The trace-gate of the Lotus and the three kalpas, six fearlessnesses, ten dwelling minds, and five-vehicle samādhi path in the Mahāvairocana Sutra also manifest the systematic order of study and practice. Also, the Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra, Yogācārabhūmi, Mahāyānasaṃgraha, Ratnagotravibhāga, Yuikyōgyō-ron, etc., all reveal this principle, and so forth. However, later generations have those who perversely grasp the Mahāyāna, falsely boasting of loftiness and subtlety, denigrating the provisional and lesser. This not only fails to accomplish self-practice but will destroy and ruin the correct track of Jambudvīpa's one teaching transformation. How can this not be

【Sixty-first Page Lower Section】
painful? Nanshan deeply investigated the profound repositories of doctrinal vehicles, carefully observed the gradual stages of cultivation and realization, earnestly indicated the correct track for entering the dharma, urgently warned about the stages of learning, intending to revive the ancient style in the declining final age. His merit is truly immense!

In Nanshan's commentaries and sub-commentaries, this principle is frequently seen - there is no leisure for detailed presentation. In the Pure Mind Admonishing Contemplation, he separately establishes one section clearly demonstrating the sequence of study and practice - this should be investigated.

Fifth, clarifying that the forty-two sages and saints are the true principle of the emptiness school, the wisdom seal of the mind-ground, and that accomplishing the ten faiths leads to entering this path, to discipline those who calculate prematurely: Generally, the advancement of the three vehicles all have stages and levels. This is the natural principle. Śrāvaka vehicle positions are sometimes divided into two - namely worthy positions and sage positions; sometimes divided into five - namely accumulation position, preparation position, penetration position, cultivation position, and completion position; sometimes divided into seven worthies and seven sages; sometimes determined as twenty-seven worthies and sages. In the pratyekabuddhayāna there are not so many positions. In Mahāyāna dharma, forty-two positions are established; adding the ten faiths makes fifty-two positions. Two positions, five positions, seven dwellings, twelve dwellings, etc. - their opening and combining are as clarified in the Yogācārabhūmi and others. The Avataṃsaka Sutra, Brahmajāla Sutra, Benevolent Kings Sutra, Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra, Yogācārabhūmi, etc., extensively explain the stages and levels of bodhisattva worthies and sages. Following nature through characteristics, the various positions are clearly distinct. Following characteristics through nature, the various positions are interfused. For those whose planted seeds are not yet mature, gradual cultivation is necessary - the forty-two positions are like climbing a multi-story building. For those whose planted virtues are mature, sudden awakening and transcendent entry occur - they need not follow sequential stages. Therefore, those who one-sidedly grasp sequential arrangement without explaining interfusion are not on the bodhisattva path. Those who one-sidedly grasp interfusion while scorning sequential arrangement are also not on the bodhisattva path.

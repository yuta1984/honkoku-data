Answer: The Tanxuan Ji (Record of Exploring the Mysteries), Five Teachings Chapter, etc., analyze and interpret the vehicle teachings with clear and brilliant textual meaning, like the sun and stars. However, Master Chengguan of Qingliang somewhat established different doctrines and did not completely follow the standards of the three patriarchs. The subtle principles of vehicle teachings thus underwent transformation. From then on, through successive transmission and exposition, the truth was gradually lost. It was like gold being transformed into brass. Recently there was a lecturer who arose with determination to correct the errors of Qingliang, Guifeng and others, and restore the truth of the three patriarchs. His teachings had already become perverted with errors and excrescences growing together. The Vehicle Outline Record was disrupted by this. Consequently, those who study the teachings gradually fell into the evil pit of falsely admiring the one vehicle while trampling on all other vehicles, boasting of false roundness while despising and abandoning the provisional and lesser teachings. It was like ambrosia being transformed into poison. How can one not deeply lament this? Although Jaku (the author) is unworthy, he deeply grieves over this declining trend. In the preface to the Tanxuan Fahui Chao, he presented both vehicle and teaching gates alongside doctrinal principles to distinguish between right and wrong. I will not repeat this redundantly now.

Fifth, cultivating entry into the dharma realm: The dharma realm is the tathāgatagarbha suchness, which is the dependent nature of all dharmas and the original foundation of dependent origination. All noble dharmas take this as their cause, hence it is called the dharma realm. The entered dharma realm is divided into five gates: first, conditioned dharma realm; second, unconditioned dharma realm; third, both conditioned and unconditioned dharma realm; fourth, neither conditioned nor unconditioned dharma realm; fifth, unobstructed dharma realm.

The first, conditioned dharma realm, has two aspects: first, the original consciousness that can hold the seeds of all dharmas, called the dharma realm, as the treatise says "the realm from beginningless time"; second, the differentiating boundaries of all dharmas of the three times, called the dharma realm. The second, unconditioned dharma realm, also has two: first, the gate of natural purity (etc.); second, the gate of freedom from defilement (etc.). The third, both conditioned and unconditioned, also has two: first, the gate following characteristics, meaning the objects of mental consciousness among the aggregates, sense fields, and elements, called the dharma realm; second, the unobstructed gate, meaning the one

mind dharma realm completely contains two gates: first, the suchness gate; second, the birth-and-death gate. Because the two gates are unobstructed, it is called the both conditioned and unconditioned dharma realm. The fourth, neither conditioned nor unconditioned dharma realm, also has two: first, the gate of mutual negation (etc.); second, the gate without dependence (etc.). The fifth, unobstructed dharma realm, also has two: first, the gate of universal inclusion (etc.); second, the gate of perfect fusion (etc.).

The entering dharma realm also has five gates: first, pure faith; second, correct understanding; third, cultivation; fourth, realization; fifth, perfection. These five, in relation to the previous five entered gates, have two aspects: first, any one entering gate penetrates the five entered gates, and any one entered gate pervades the five entering gates; second, these five entering gates enter the five entered gates in sequence. The entered gates also have five levels: first, dharma dharma realm; second, person dharma realm; third, person-dharma mutually fused dharma realm; fourth, person-dharma mutually transcended dharma realm; fifth, unobstructed dharma realm. The first contains ten: phenomena-principle, object-practice, essence-function, accordance-opposition, teaching-meaning. These ten share the same dependent origination in unobstructed fusion. The next person dharma realm also has ten gates: humans, devas, men, women, religious and lay persons, buddhas, bodhisattvas, heretics, and various spirits, expressing dependent origination. Mutually fused and mutually transcended, unobstructed - contemplate this in accordance with principle. The entering dharma realm also has five levels: first, body; second, wisdom; third, both; fourth, transcendence; fifth, perfection. This can be understood according to the above.

The entered dharma realm is the dharma realm manifested by the Tathāgata's Lion's Vigorous Samādhi. When on the causal stage, it is called Samantabhadra. The entering dharma realm is the Mañjuśrī gate. However, the entering, in relation to the fruition dharma realm, reveals sudden entry; in relation to the causal dharma realm, it manifests gradual entry. The perfect fusion of gradual and sudden is the fruition aspect dharma realm of the separate teaching gate. When gradual and sudden are differentiated, sudden entry is the causal aspect dharma realm of the separate teaching gate; gradual entry is the various vehicle dharma realms of the shared teaching gate. How wonderful indeed is the Huayan dharma realm ten-ground maṇḍala!

【Nineteenth Page Upper Section】
Within this are complete all wholesome dharmas of the mundane, supramundane, and supreme supramundane. Speaking in terms of teachings, from a single phrase or verse below to the inexhaustible great ocean of teachings above. Speaking in terms of understanding and practice, from initial minor wisdom and slight goodness to inexhaustible and unlimited merit, wisdom, vows and practices. Nothing fails to flow out from this Huayan dharma realm and return to this Huayan dharma realm ocean. Why is this so? Because this ten-ground maṇḍala is precisely the five types of entering and entered dharma realms.

The paths of the first, second, and third grounds correspond to the conditioned dharma realm, and the wholesome practices of human and deva vehicles flow equally from this. The paths of the fourth, fifth, and sixth grounds correspond to the unconditioned dharma realm, and the wholesome dharmas of the two vehicles flow equally from this. The path of the seventh ground corresponds to the both conditioned and unconditioned dharma realm, and the path of the three worthy stages of bodhisattvas flows equally from this. The entering mind of the eighth ground is mysteriously quiescent and without dependence, like awakening from a great dream. This corresponds to the neither conditioned nor unconditioned dharma realm. From the dwelling mind of the eighth ground onward to buddhahood, the supreme supramundane dharmas of the one vehicle are called the unobstructed dharma realm.

Therefore the entering dharma realm naturally has two gates. If it is the separate teaching gate, then the inexhaustible, inexhaustible faith, understanding and practice throughout the dharma realm are fused without foundation, like drawing in empty space - it is merely what the eye of Samantabhadra perceives. If it is the shared teaching gate, then it awakens all sentient beings of the seventh ground and below through universal gates responding to faculties. The faith, understanding, practice and realization embraced by one vehicle, two vehicles, three vehicles, five vehicles up to innumerable vehicles are all the entering dharma realm.

However, the entering dharma realm of the separate teaching gate has three levels of difference: seeing-hearing, understanding-practice, and realization-entry. The so-called seeing-hearing stage is the scope entered by sentient beings of Mt. Sumeru worlds, etc. The so-called understanding-practice stage is the scope entered by great beings such as the Pure Jewel Net Wheel-Turning Kings of world-systems and above. The so-called realization

【Nineteenth Page Lower Section】
entry stage is the scope of great bodhisattvas with Samantabhadra's eye in the Lotus Treasury World, where the causal stage reaches complete fullness. The so-called perfect luminosity with complete virtues, Indra's subtlety, etc., transcends the great white dharma realm and beyond - these are the mysterious secret realms of the stage where form and mind are liberated, profound and mysterious. The realization-entry stage realizes and enters it; the understanding-practice stage understands and practices it; the seeing-hearing stage looks up and has faith in it.

Therefore, the understanding-practice stage still relies on principal cultivation and auxiliary cultivation to advance toward this path. How much more so for the seeing-hearing stage! Generally, the leisurely ordinary beings of Jambudvīpa are mostly at the seeing-hearing stage. Among them, if they are of the highest capacity, they directly contemplate the dharma realm Indra, dwelling in transcendent non-obstruction. If they are of middle or lower capacity, they either accumulate phenomenal good deeds or rely on the two emptinesses, consciousness-only, cessation of delusion and cultivation of truth as expedient means to assist the principal cultivation. This is like the Tiantai school's three types of śamatha-vipaśyanā having gradual and sudden cultivation. For gradual cultivation, gathering provisional and lesser teachings to assist principal cultivation is naturally beyond question. Even for sudden cultivation, one cannot lack the significance of using phenomenal good deeds or the two emptinesses, consciousness-only, mind-only, etc., as auxiliary cultivation. Why is this so? Phenomenal good deeds or the two emptinesses and three natures, etc., are precisely the foundation and root of the ten mysterious dependent origination dharma realm Indra. The one vehicle tower and pavilion is established by this; the nature-arising tree treasury flourishes by this; the jewel king Tathāgata appears by this; the Flower Treasury World is adorned by this. Therefore, those who practice perfect cultivation also rely on this as auxiliary cultivation. However, because they take perfect faith and understanding as their commander, they are not the same as provisional cultivation.

As clarified in the middle volume of the Five Teachings Chapter regarding the scope of meaning: first clarifying the similarities and differences of the three natures, next clarifying the six-meaning dependent origination, and then clarifying the ten mysteries and six characteristics. This is the dharma gate of the three natures - when the imputed nature is blocked, the dependent and perfected natures' characteristics beyond speech are manifested. However, when other-dependent dependent origination is established in the ālayavijñāna, nature and characteristics are separated.

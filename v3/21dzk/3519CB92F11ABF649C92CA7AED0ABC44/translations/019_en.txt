This error is extremely grave. Generally speaking, all Mahāyāna canonical texts such as the Laṅkāvatāra, Śūraṅgama, Vimalakīrti,思益, Yuanjue, Avataṃsaka, Prajñā, Lotus, Nirvāṇa, and the two esoteric sūtras are all direct paths of "directly pointing to the human mind, seeing nature, and achieving buddhahood." Why is this so? Because all the above-mentioned sūtras awaken sentient beings through the ultimate truth of the true characteristic of all dharmas. What is the ultimate truth of the true characteristic of all dharmas if not mind-nature itself? This is called "Great Extensive Buddha Avataṃsaka," also called "Prajñāpāramitā," also called "Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower," also called "Great Nirvāṇa," also called "Great Perfect Enlightenment," also called "Śūraṅgama Samādhi," also called "Great Compassion Garbha," also called "A-Lotus-Moon," also called "Buddha-nature," also called "Dharmadhātu," also called "Tathāgatagarbha." The Vimalakīrti Sūtra states: "All sentient beings are the characteristic of bodhi. All sentient beings are great nirvāṇa." The Samantabhadra Contemplation Sūtra states: "The cause of Mahāyāna is the true characteristic of all dharmas. The fruit of Mahāyāna is the true characteristic of all dharmas." The Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra states: "Departing from the true characteristic of all dharmas are all called demonic activities." Also, directly pointing to mind-nature is called the great direct path. The Lion's Roar chapter of the Nirvāṇa Sūtra states: "Directly contemplating mind-nature is called the supreme samādhi." The Bodhisattvabhūmi calls this "intrinsic nature meditation," the Laṅkāvatāra calls it "Tathāgata meditation," and the Mañjuśrī Prajñā calls it "single-practice samādhi." There is no time to elaborate on these various texts.

However, in the above-mentioned sūtras, through horizontal and vertical expositions with meandering literary meanings, the two gates of emptiness and existence assist in manifesting the true characteristic. This is precisely the expedient means within the Tathāgatagarbha essence, like drawing in empty space. How can this be called partial or provisional? If this were provisional principle, then would all the thousands of transformations of the mechanisms employed by the Chan ancestors also be called provisional principle? Like the Avataṃsaka, Lotus, and two esoteric sūtras, where each word and sentence

are maṇḍala wisdom-seals, one still cannot call this merely "the finger pointing at the moon." How much less the discussion of direct versus non-direct! For example, suppose an immortal holds a red silk fan covering his face, standing within colorful clouds. Those who look up from the ground might see the colorful clouds, or see the silk fan, or see the immortal's hands and feet, or see the immortal's complete form. The metaphor is clear. Regarding bodhisattvas of deep stages, there is naturally no need for discussion. When the Buddha-eye barely opens within the nominal stage, one naturally knows that the above-mentioned sūtras are "words that are non-words," supremely mysterious and subtle, unsurpassed and unequalled great dharma treasures. This is seeing the complete form. Those who call this the teaching vehicle but not the path of directly pointing to see nature are like those who see clouds and fans. Someone says: "The Chan school inherently transcends capacities and teachings, incomparable to the teaching vehicles." Although this serves to support the sect and cannot be blamed, it is not an impartial discussion. Why? The realization of the path in all three vehicles transcends capacities and teachings. How is it that only Chan transcends capacity and teaching? Know that although Chan and the teachings have different approaches, their destination is one. Question: "The teachings categorize doctrine, principle, wisdom, elimination, practice, stages, causes and results, while Chan demonstrates 'one leap directly entering the Tathāgata stage,' etc. How can we say Chan and teachings share the same destination?" Answer: Xuěyán said: "Suddenly heaven collapses and earth caves in, opening wide the deluded clouds of myriad kalpas to directly see the original face. This is merely a temporary crossroads, called 'a tile for knocking on the door,' not a family treasure." Wéishān said: "If one can suddenly awaken to the right cause, then one leaves the dusty stages and goes through gradualness." The sūtra states: "Principle is suddenly awakened, but the matters that are simultaneously eliminated by riding on awakening are not suddenly removed—they are exhausted through sequence. Although this matter has no cultivation and no realization,

one simply exhausts ordinary sentiments with no separate sage understanding. How can exhausting ordinary sentiments be easy? In establishing the forty-two stages within the Tathāgata stage, the reality is nothing more than exhausting ordinary sentiments. How can exhausting ordinary sentiments be easy?" Mùzhōu said: "When the great matter is not yet clear, it is like losing one's parents. When the great matter is already clear, it is still like losing one's parents." If one can thoroughly read and contemplate these few phrases, the principle of Chan and teachings sharing the same destination becomes clear, requiring no answer from me. The meaning of those Chan ancestors breaking characteristics and criticizing teachings, driving out the harmful demons within the teachings, was explained in the previous volume.

In the world there is the "Six Gates of Shaolin." According to tradition, the Six Gates were entirely composed by the First Ancestor.
I privately think this book was compiled by later people, with authentic and false materials mixed together in a distinguishable way.

That third gate demonstrates "two types of entry." Now, there are many paths for entering the Way, but to summarize, they do not exceed three types. First is principle-entry, second is practice-entry. Principle-entry means relying on teachings to awaken to the essence, deeply believing that all sentient beings share the same true nature, but are merely covered by adventitious dust and false thoughts, unable to manifest clearly. If one abandons the false and returns to the true, concentrating in wall-gazing, with no self and no other, ordinary and sage being equal, abiding firmly without moving, no longer following textual teachings—this corresponds with principle in mysterious unity, without discrimination, serene and non-active. This is called principle-entry. Practice-entry refers to four practices. All other practices are entirely included within these. What are the four? First, repaying resentment practice; second, following conditions practice; third, seeking nothing practice; fourth, according with dharma practice. It even states a verse: "Externally cease all conditions, internally the mind has no panting. Mind like a wall—thus one can enter the Way." Details are as given in that source.

I think these two types of entry were taught by Shaolin for those unable to see directly. This text can accord with the teaching vehicles and can be called correct dharma and correct cultivation.

The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sūtra states: "The true characteristic is profound and subtle, its principle deep. Like climbing an absolute precipice necessarily requires a flying ladder, wanting to contract with the true source essentially depends on teaching and practice. Therefore, establishing practice as the gate... The Buddha-dharma cannot be proclaimed and demonstrated, yet those who speak according to conditions must use the four propositions to elaborate principle, able to lead practitioners into the ground of true reality." It also states: "The four gates enter the clear cool pool. These gates are unobstructed—not only the sharp-faculties gain entry. The dull also enter. Not only those in concentration, but scattered-mind practitioners who focus their will and are diligent also gain entry. Prajñā has four types of characteristics: namely existence-characteristic, non-existence-characteristic, up to neither-existence-characteristic nor non-existence-characteristic. Prajñā is not even one characteristic—how could it have four characteristics? This is also a gate for entering prajñā." It also states: "Prajñāpāramitā is like a great flame—it cannot be grasped from any of the four sides because it burns with the fire of wrong views. If one does not touch the fire, it warms the body and cooks food. If one touches the fire, the fire burns the body. Once the body is burned, warming food is useless. The four gates originally lead to prajñā to accomplish the great matter. If one grasps and clings, it becomes wrong view," etc. It also states: "Relying on teachings to generate the true makes teaching the gate. If upon first hearing teaching, like a swift horse seeing the shadow of a whip and immediately entering the correct path, one need not cultivate contemplation. If upon first cultivating contemplation, like seeing lightning in the night and immediately gaining sight of the Way, one need not further require teaching. Both represent past good roots having matured—now gaining penetration in the teaching gate is called 'faith-practice,' gaining penetration in the contemplation gate is called 'dharma-practice.' If upon hearing one does not immediately awaken, one should cultivate

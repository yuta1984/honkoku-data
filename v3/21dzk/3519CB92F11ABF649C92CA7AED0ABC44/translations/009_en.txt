He awakened without a teacher and deeply comprehended the mysterious principles of the Avataṃsaka (Flower Garland). Later he listened to Yunhua's lectures on the Avataṃsaka Sūtra, which resonated with his faculties and created perfect accord, and he further investigated the profound secrets. He then composed the Huayan Tanxuan Ji (Record of Exploring the Mysteries of Huayan), along with the Essential Outline, Five Teachings Chapter, Record of the Mind's Journey through the Dharma Realm, Complete Elimination Returning to Source, Meaning-Ocean Hundred Gates, etc., exhausting his efforts to promote this school. The Avataṃsaka school's teachings were thus completely equipped. The pure source of the three patriarchs was cut off from this point - how regrettable!

Although Qingliang Master Chengguan, Guifeng Chan Master Zongmi, etc., inherited and succeeded this school, they occasionally established different doctrines that, compared to the three patriarchs, showed considerable divergence. Each established their own school and flourished for a time. Although their teachings all had their reasoning, they were not the correct intent of the three patriarchs. The reason they are not included in the dharma lineage lies in this. Their differences are like those discussed in the Tanxuan Fahui and other texts.

Second, clarifying the Huayan doctrinal characteristics: This Huayan Sūtra is the dharma maṇḍala realized by Vairocana, with inexhaustible doctrinal meaning pervading the three realms. There are Buddha's teachings, bodhisattva teachings, land teachings, sentient being teachings, and teachings of all three times. The Huayan Essential Meaning presents ten categories of sūtras; the Tanxuan Ji establishes six categories of sūtras: the eternal original, great original, superior original, middle original, lower original, and abbreviated original. The so-called eternal original is the dharma realm sūtra sensed by Samantabhadra. The great original is also what is maintained by the dhāraṇī power of great bodhisattvas. The superior and middle originals are still secretly preserved in the heavenly dragon palaces and are not what Jambudvīpa sentient beings can uphold. The lower original is the hundred thousand verses, where dharma-transmitting bodhisattvas, relying on various times, places, people and dharmas, briefly gather the teachings and meanings numerous as atoms in the dharma realm to enable Jambudvīpa sentient beings to gain the benefit of seeing and hearing. From this lower original, what is briefly extracted and translated are the abbreviated originals, which are

the currently circulating new and old translation editions. What was translated in the Jin dynasty has eight assemblies and thirty-four chapters, broadly divided into five parts. The first, the Chapter on the Pure Eyes of the World, is the section on causal conditions and dependent origination. It lists the three worlds to symbolically reveal the conditional gathering of the dharma realm. Next, the Vairocana Chapter is the section on presenting the fruit to encourage delight and generate faith. The fruit is Vairocana's Flower Treasury World; the cause is the youth Universal Adornment. These two dharmas of cause and fruit are the meaning of the tathāgatagarbha mind-essence, which serves as the object of faith. Next, from the Chapter on Names to the Chapter on the Tathāgata's Nature-Arising, thirty chapters constitute the section where cultivated causes accord with fruit to generate understanding. Within this, the first twenty-eight chapters are differentiated cause and fruit, also called cultivated cause and fruit. The latter two chapters are equal cause and fruit, also called cultivation-revelation cause and fruit. These two cause-and-fruits are "two yet not-two, not-two yet two." Why? When differentiated cause and fruit is illuminated by universal wisdom, it becomes equal cause and fruit. The causes are all Samantabhadra's practices; the fruit accomplishes the Tathāgata's nature-arising. Therefore, in the previous cultivated-birth cause and fruit, the first twenty-five chapters are cause, the latter three chapters are fruit. If judged according to the separate teaching gate, cause means seeing, hearing, understanding and practice; fruit means realization and entry. If judged according to the shared teaching gate, the first Chapter on Names expresses and reveals the wholesome roots of humans and devas that accord with liberation; the next Chapter on the Four Noble Truths expresses and reveals the shared teaching of the two vehicles. The next Chapter on Light and Awakening is conventional truth - the perfectly imagined as empty. The next Chapter on Clarifying Difficulties is ultimate truth - the other-dependent as seemingly existent. The above two chapters are the initial gate of Mahāyāna, expressing and revealing the shared teaching of the three vehicles. From the next Chapter on Pure Practices onward is the one real truth - the middle way perfectly accomplished reality,離有離無 [transcending existence and non-existence], expressing and revealing the shared teaching of the one vehicle. The faith, abodes, practices, dedications, grounds, and buddhahood within this are precisely faith, understanding, practice, and realization. Within realization there are also partial realization and complete realization. The correspondences can be understood. These two types of cause and fruit

are entirely manifested through the wisdom of the two emptinesses and middle way clearly illuminating and breaking through ignorance and the categories of delusions arising from ignorance. Therefore they belong to the Mañjuśrī gate and are called the section that generates understanding. The next Chapter on Transcending the World is the section on entrusting dharma, advancing, and accomplishing practice - namely accomplished practice cause and fruit. This belongs to the Samantabhadra gate. The shared and separate two gates are as clarified in Tanxuan volume seventeen. The final Chapter on Entering the Dharma Realm is the section on relying on people to enter realization and accomplish virtue - namely realization-entry cause and fruit. This is the meaning of transcending defilement and transformation into unity. The ability to enter the dharma realm is the Mañjuśrī gate; the entered dharma realm is the Samantabhadra gate. The original assembly is the realm of Buddha and Samantabhadra, corresponding to the separate teaching unshared gate. The final assembly has three parts, containing the shared teaching common gate. The first monk assembly is the shared teaching of the two vehicles. The next dragon palace assembly is the shared teaching of the three vehicles. The final Sudhana assembly is the shared teaching of the one vehicle. This perfectly accords with the above cultivated-birth cause-fruit shared-separate meaning gates. However, the former clarifies in terms of understanding; this demonstrates in terms of realization. Moreover, the shared teaching of humans and devas is included in the two vehicles, as can be understood. Speaking of concluding the vehicles: one vehicle, two vehicles, three vehicles, five vehicles, up to innumerable vehicles. Speaking in terms of teachings: Hīnayāna, initial, final, and sudden are all gates of Huayan shared teaching - wonderful dharma ambrosia that rescues and embraces sentient beings of the seventh ground and below. Those who receive this dharma all ultimately return to enter the Huayan dharma realm without exception. This should be fully understood. Third, the Huayan sectarian aims: This sūtra takes cause-fruit dependent origination and the real dharma realm as its sectarian aim. The real dharma realm is the tathāgatagarbha mind. The Samantabhadra dharma realm serves as cause; the Vairocana dharma realm serves as fruit. Cause-fruit dependent origination is the five cycles of cause and fruit. Within this, Samantabhadra cause and fruit is the separate teaching unshared dependent origination. The cause and fruit of two vehicles, three vehicles, five vehicles, etc., is the shared teaching common gate dependent origination, as can be understood. Moreover, the dharma realm dharma gate briefly discusses ten matters in five pairs:

【Seventeenth Page Lower Section】
teaching-meaning, principle-phenomena, object-wisdom, practice-stage, cause-fruit. The so-called teaching and meaning mutually serve as sectarian aims, and the lower four pairs are also likewise. This is detailed in the Tanxuan analysis. These ten matters in five pairs can embrace all the doctrinal meanings of two vehicles, three vehicles, five vehicles, etc., and even the shared-separate two gates of cause and fruit. This can be understood according to the above. Moreover, the dharma realm cause-fruit has distinguished manifestation with ten meanings in five gates. First, the incomparable object, namely the dharma realm of suchness. This has two positions: first, the dharma realm freed from entanglement and separated from defilement; second, the dharma realm entangled yet naturally pure. These two serve as the objects of faith and realization. Second, incomparable mind, which also has two meanings: first, great bodhi mind; second, faith, compassion, wisdom, etc. Third, incomparable practice, which also has two meanings: first, differentiated practice; second, Samantabhadra practice. Fourth, incomparable stage, which also has two meanings: first, sequential differentiated stages; second, perfect fusion mutually embracing stages. Fifth, incomparable fruit, which also has two meanings: first, cultivated birth fruit; second, cultivation-revelation fruit. These five gates comprehensively gather the great Huayan teaching ocean as the sectarian aim. Moreover, these five gates, according to the separate teaching gate, are all the wisdom realm of Samantabhadra. Why? Because the ten meanings are fused and unified. According to the shared teaching gate, two vehicles, three vehicles, five vehicles up to innumerable vehicles progress from subtle to manifest, from particular to universal. Moreover, dharma realm cause-fruit are mutually fused and transcendent, meaning nature and characteristics are fused in unobstructed freedom. This also has ten meanings. First, by transcending characteristics, cause and fruit are not different from the dharma realm. Second, by transcending nature, the dharma realm is not different from cause and fruit... up to the tenth: cause and fruit, each following their distinctions in the two positions - every single dharma, every single practice, every single virtue, every single stage each comprehensively embraces inexhaustible, inexhaustible seas of dharma gates. This should be understood as the inexhaustible sectarian aim of Huayan. Fourth, the scope of vehicles: the Five Teachings Śamatha-Vipaśyanā, Essential Meanings Chapter, Fifty Essential Questions

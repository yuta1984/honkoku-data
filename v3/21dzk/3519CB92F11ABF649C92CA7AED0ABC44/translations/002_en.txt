Also manifesting the three natures, three non-natures, two kinds of selflessness, consciousness-only, and mind-only, without contradicting the correct principle of dependent origination - this is called the correct dharma teaching.

The three natures and three non-natures, etc., are as clarified in the Laṅkāvatāra Sutra, Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra, Abhidharmasamuccaya, Buddha-nature Treatise, Mahāyānasaṃgraha, Trisvabhāvanirdeśa, and others.

Also proclaiming the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment, three trainings, six perfections, ten correct practices, etc., entering into śamatha and vipaśyanā - this is called the correct dharma teaching. How wondrous! When sentient beings follow the deluded karma arising from ignorance, their very essence becomes a shell; pursuing emotions they lose their nature, generating illusions from what is not illusion, sinking into the ocean of existence. When they accord with teachings and practices based on correct principle, the doors of their minds turn on their hinges; releasing attachments they return to pristine clarity, delusion ends and illusion ceases, returning to great extinction. Delusion and enlightenment are merely the turning of one mind - simply going against or according with one's nature.

What sutras constitute this so-called correct dharma teaching, and how did the Buddha proclaim them? How did the patriarchs transmit and maintain them?

The Buddhas and Tathāgatas have three kinds of bodies. What are the three? Namely the dharma body, reward body, and transformation body. When expanded, they become four bodies up to ten bodies. The so-called dharma body dwells in the dharma-nature land; body and land are non-dual, pristinely and eternally abiding. Neither body-land nor non-body-land, neither characteristics nor non-characteristics, transcending existence and non-existence - only what wisdom illuminates. The so-called reward body has two kinds: the self-enjoyment body and the other-enjoyment body. The self-enjoyment body dwells in the self-enjoyment land. When some places speak of locations, this is merely provisional indication. The true meaning is that the self-reward body-land pervades the dharma realm; one cannot say it is separate from the three realms, nor can one say it is identical with the three realms. For indescribably countless retinues

it teaches indescribably countless dharmas. Such body-land can only be known by Buddha with Buddha. It is not even the realm of those who will be enlightened in one lifetime - how much less so for others.

When ancient worthies of the Tiantai and Shingon schools discussed the dharma body and self-reward as having characteristics and teaching, their purpose was to use such explanations to provisionally reveal the profound excellence of the dharma, and to cure the disease of views that generate faults through one-sided attachment to the formless. But later generations, ignorant of that original intent, recklessly speak of having characteristics and teaching, considering themselves sublime and wonderful. Yet their understanding hovers in the realm of existence-nonexistence opposition, like a foolish dog chasing clods, completely unaware that their theory already resembles the calculations of the two assemblies and three virtues.

The other-enjoyment body either resides at the summit of the three realms, or dwells in pure lands beyond the realms, or abides in the Lotus Treasury World, turning the perfect dharma wheel of the One Vehicle for bodhisattvas who have entered the great stages. This is as in the Avataṃsaka, Buddha Stage treatises, etc. Transformation bodies roughly have two kinds: some appear in pure lands, others appear in defiled lands. Buddhas appearing in pure lands openly teach Mahāyāna and the three vehicles while secretly turning the dharma wheel of the One Vehicle. Buddhas appearing in defiled realms openly teach the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha vehicles while secretly turning the esoteric dharma wheels of Mahāyāna, the three vehicles, and the One Vehicle.

The distinction between manifest and esoteric has five kinds in general: First, the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha vehicles are called manifest teaching, while all Mahāyāna dharmas are called esoteric teaching, as judged in the fourth volume of the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra. Second, Mahāyāna three-vehicle teaching is called manifest, while One Vehicle teaching is called esoteric, as judged in the hundredth volume of the Prajñā Śāstra. Third, all Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna teachings are entirely manifest teaching, while maṇḍala teaching is called esoteric

【Third Page Upper Section】
teaching, as judged by the esoteric school. Fourth, scriptures of provisional meaning are called having concealed intent, while scriptures of definitive meaning are called manifest, as judged by the Consciousness-Only school. Fifth, teaching both great and small vehicles with all mutually aware is called manifest, while the three wheels' esoteric transformation with mutual unawareness is called esoteric, as judged by the Tiantai school. What is spoken of here should be understood as belonging to the first two categories.

Our Śākyamuni Buddha, riding the wheel of great vows, descended to be born in Jambudvīpa at Kapilavastu, manifested the eight phases, achieved perfect enlightenment under the Bodhi tree in Magadha, and whether manifestly or esoterically turned the correct dharma wheel to guide and benefit sentient beings. The so-called manifest dharma wheel relies on the aggregates, sense-fields, and elements to reveal the four noble truths, causation, selflessness, and the human path, with the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment as practice and cessation through discrimination as fruit. This is the initial sweet dew for heavily obstructed sentient beings of Jambudvīpa to transform from ordinary to sage. The so-called esoteric dharma wheel is when the Tathāgata abides in the most tranquil great nirvana realm, and in the ocean-seal samādhi clearly manifests the dharma maṇḍala that accords with true nature. The Buddha teaches, bodhisattvas teach, lands teach, sentient beings teach, all of the three times teach - suddenly raising the mysterious principles to lead the superior while gradually spreading subtle benefits to moisten all capacities. Universally distinguishing colors separately, everywhere spreading the teaching and meaning of the One Vehicle, making cause and fruit equal to dignify the pavilions of nature-origination. This is called the Mahāvaipulya Buddha Avataṃsaka Sutra and is the fundamental dharma wheel. Sometimes for those who have already practiced as great śrāvakas and those of great capacity with light defilements, entering the samādhi of the king of meditative absorption, etc., teaching Mahāyāna and the three vehicles, relying on the principle of two truths to reveal the two emptinesses and the path of bodhisattvas' provisional emergence, reaching attainment of the enlightenment of the three vehicles, as taught in the Prajñāpāramitā, Saṃdhinirmocana, etc. This is called the branch dharma wheel. Since this teaching does not clearly explain the One Vehicle and

【Third Page Lower Section】
one nature, it is called the three-vehicle teaching. Sometimes for those of supreme great capacity whose wisdom of the two selflessnesses is already pure and whose merit of cultivating the six perfections through conditions is complete, entering deep samādhi to turn the Tathāgata-garbha One Vehicle dharma wheel, gathering the three to return to one, absorbing characteristics to return to nature - like entering the samādhi of immeasurable meanings to teach the Wonderful Lotus Dharma, entering the immovable samādhi to teach the Great Nirvana, etc. This is called the dharma wheel that gathers branches to return to the source. It should be known that the four noble truths dharma wheel is the manifest turning, while Mahāyāna teaching is the esoteric turning. In the Prajñāpāramitā, it points to the Prajñāpāramitā and calls it "the second dharma wheel turning in Jambudvīpa." The Lotus Sutra also says, "Formerly at Benares I turned the four noble truths dharma wheel, now I again turn the supreme and greatest dharma wheel," etc. All reveal that Mahāyāna is indeed the wheel of no-self of persons, already turning the esoteric wheel manifested by the samādhi of pudgala.

Such transformative ceremonies as above are the constant standards for guiding and transforming in defiled worlds, and the Tathāgatas of the three times share the same Buddha-way, as explained in the "Skillful Means" chapter of the Lotus Sutra.

Question: Why is it that in defiled worlds only the four noble truths dharma wheel is proclaimed and the great vehicle dharma teaching is not clearly explained? Answer: The sentient beings of Jambudvīpa have dull faculties and heavy obstructions, grasping the characteristics of aggregates, deeply attached to the five desires, entering the dense forest of wrong views, unable to receive the profound scriptures of the great vehicle. If for those of lesser faculties and inferior capacity one directly teaches profound dharmas, they will generate wrong views and wrong attachments, weaving nets of false views - like a snake drinking water and making it poison. Even if some gain correct understanding and correct views, being hesitant about the stages of what they study, many imitate what seems right but is not, just like painting a tiger but creating a dog. Therefore the Tathāgata, from the boundless and extremely deep ocean of truth, scoops up a single drop of water to moisten

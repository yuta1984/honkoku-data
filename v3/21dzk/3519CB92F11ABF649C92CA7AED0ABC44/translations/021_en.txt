compared to those great bodhisattvas. Comparing the six troublemakers to Śāriputra, Maudgalyāyana and others, their superiority and inferiority are evident. Yet even Śāriputra, Maudgalyāyana and others were still considered to have dull faculties and heavy obstructions. How much more so for others? How much more so for students of the final age?
In the age of semblance and final dharma, even those of middle capacity would be rare. How much more so for superior capacity?

Now, for those of middle and lower capacities, they should first rely on the three sutras and five treatises to gain faith and understanding of the correct principle of cause and effect in defiled and pure dependent origination, the two emptinesses of persons and phenomena, their own mind-nature tathāgatagarbha mind, the original cessation of all phenomena, and self-nature nirvana. They should fiercely generate the mind of liberation from birth and death and abide peacefully in the supreme bodhi mind. Next, they should abandon worldly five desires, fame and profit, official honors, love and hate, favorable and adverse conditions, etc., like casting off worn sandals. Then they should thoroughly read Chan Master Hanshan's expedient words and Yunqi's collected "Chan Barrier Advancement," roughly understanding their meaning. They should either directly investigate the nature of their own mind or take up a single koan case, not selecting among the four deportments, not questioning movement and stillness, not calculating ten or twenty years, one or two lifetimes, one or two kalpas—investigating back and forth, taking awakening as the standard. However, the essential point of studying the Way necessarily relies on stillness and clarity—just as going out necessarily requires passing through a door. An ancient said: "If you sit quietly without applying effort, in what year will you pass the examination and awaken to mind-emptiness?" Also: "You must directly raise the hair-cutting sword to dissect the First Principle from the West. If you remain silent and indulgent like a fool, know that you do not yet understand how to do the work." This is the precious vehicle of dual operation of stillness and clarity. Stillness and clarity are also called cessation and alertness. Using dhyāna to cease false thoughts through cessation is stillness; using correct wisdom to investigate mind-nature is clarity. These two are the wondrous way of dharma-nature's naturalness—like a cart's two wheels or a bird's two wings. Lacking one, it is not the true correct way.

Now, precepts, concentration, and wisdom are the wondrous practices of dharma-nature's naturalness and the correct track of Śākyamuni's single transformation. This is called the three decisive ways, also called the limit of learning. Following this is called Śākya's dharma; violating this is called Devadatta's dharma. The ancient worthies' teaching of wisdom first, concentration later was merely expedient transformation for remedying problems of that time.
Later generations often invoke the principle of wisdom first, concentration later, or cite the sudden enlightenment of Elder Lu, Shigong, Deshan, Linji and others to suppress the way of dhyāna contemplation. There is also one type that confusedly identifies themselves with the ranks of those already awakened and thoroughly enlightened, calling the precious teaching of "externally ceasing all conditions, internally without mental agitation" and the clear instruction to "eliminate the confused mind of meal times and miscellaneous activities" merely expedient methods, discarding them like dung. How could these be true correct masters? I, Jaku, secretly maintain that dhyāna contemplation is the root pillar of the Buddha Way. Therefore, in the past when Buddha was in the world during the correct dharma period, all who left home to study the Way, except for meals and natural functions, either relied on tree-bases or charnel grounds, or stayed in forest hermitages and empty rooms, sitting cross-legged to contemplate the four foundations of mindfulness—this was the correct track of one transformation.
But when the dharma entered the semblance and final periods, gradually becoming longer and more diluted, people galloped through the thoroughfares of conceptual characteristics and written words without entering the gate of concentration and wisdom. The root pillar of correct dharma was about to collapse. At that time, the Chan patriarchs arose abruptly and supported the way of concentration and wisdom—truly the bright banner of the final age. Yet for those in the Chan school who do not appreciate the way of dhyāna contemplation, it is exactly like warriors who do not appreciate archery and horsemanship. How could one emulate the sudden enlightenment of Elder Lu and Shigong while teaching people the way of woodcutters and hunters? Even if it were work of remedying problems, would it not be like rescuing a drowning person by handing them a stone?

There was Chan Master Changlu Cijue who wrote "Sitting Meditation Procedures." His words state: "Now, bodhisattvas who study prajñā should first arouse great compassionate mind, generate vast vow-aspirations, intensively cultivate samādhi, and vow to liberate sentient beings—not seeking liberation solely for oneself. Then abandon all conditions, cease myriad affairs, with body and mind as one, no gap between movement and stillness. Measure food intake—neither too much nor too little. Regulate sleep—neither restricted nor indulgent.
When wishing to sit in meditation, in a quiet place spread thick sitting material, loosely tie clothing and belt, making deportment neat and orderly. Then sit in full lotus position, first placing the right foot on the left thigh. After body posture is settled and breathing regulated, relax the navel and abdomen. Do not think about any good or evil at all. When thoughts arise, immediately be aware; being aware, they immediately disappear. After long practice, forgetting conditions naturally becomes unified. This is the essential technique of sitting meditation.
For those who already have realization, it can be said to be like a dragon obtaining water or a tiger leaning on a mountain. For those not yet realized, it is also like using wind to fan fire—not requiring much effort. Simply discern the willing mind and it will definitely not deceive. However, when the way is high, demons are active—favorable and adverse circumstances are manifold, but if you can maintain correct mindfulness present, nothing can obstruct or hinder. When wishing to exit concentration, gradually move the body and rise peacefully. After exiting concentration, constantly create expedient means at all times to protect concentration power like protecting an infant—then concentration power easily develops. The single gate of dhyāna concentration is most urgent business. If you do not practice peaceful meditation and quiet contemplation, arriving here you will necessarily be bewildered. Therefore, to search for pearls you should calm the waves—if you disturb the water, retrieval becomes difficult. When concentration water is clear and pure, the mind-pearl naturally appears. The Yuanjue Sutra says: 'Unobstructed pure wisdom all depends on dhyāna concentration for birth.' The Lotus Sutra says: 'Dwelling in quiet places, cultivate and gather the mind, abiding unmoved like Mount Sumeru.' Know that

transcending the ordinary and surpassing the sacred necessarily borrows quiet conditions; liberation while sitting or standing requires relying on concentration power. Even accomplishing in one lifetime, one still fears making mistakes. How much more with procrastination—with what will you resist karma? An ancient said: 'Without concentration power, you willingly submit to the gate of death, covering your eyes and returning empty, clearly wandering in confusion.' Fortunately, fellow Chan practitioners, read this text three times—self-benefit and benefiting others, equally accomplish correct awakening." This text skillfully summarizes the essentials of Chan and exhaustively covers the beginning and end of studying the Way. It should be prepared as a model.

Like the Third Patriarch's "Faith in Mind Verse," the Sixth Patriarch's "Platform Sutra," the "Record of Linji," Shitou's "Merging of Difference and Unity," Yongqia's "Song of Realization," etc.—all are precious teachings of the Chan gate. If one possesses correct faith and correct views, without any trace of crafty, restless, or impetuous sickness, or has already been embraced by the gradual stages of entering principle with worldly feelings gradually fading and mysterious treasures gradually opening—such a person viewing these would be like a dragon obtaining clouds. But if those of inferior faculties and superficial understanding view them, they immediately generate deviant views and fall into dangerous ravines. It is like a weak and cowardly person being given Zhu Hai's hammer or Guan Yu's sword—inevitably stumbling and injuring themselves. The most extreme use these to speak of the ultimate, lightly disparaging the vinaya, scorning and abandoning sutras and treatises, falling into evil attachment to emptiness, heading toward icchantika. No harm is greater than this.

Second, distinguishing unawakened from awakened: unawakened and awakened are extremely difficult to distinguish. Therefore, students encounter clear-eyed good spiritual friends, undergo repeated testing and verification, then know awakened from unawakened and the shallow, deep, heterodox or orthodox aspects of their attainments. However, if discriminating examination is not careful and decisive selection loses the truth, one easily becomes close to wrong people, recognizing the heterodox as orthodox. Seeking bright teachers in today's final dharma age is as rare as unicorn horns. It is better to use the measure of sacred teachings to investigate one's own mental activities. Now, the Chan school takes Buddha-mind as its essence and sudden awakening as its teaching. Its not being limited by judgmental wisdom and elimination of afflictions

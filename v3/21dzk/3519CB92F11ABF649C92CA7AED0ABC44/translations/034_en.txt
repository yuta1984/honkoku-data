And so on. The second volume of the Karma Commentary clarifies that the equal cultivation of the three studies cannot be lacking. And so on. In the middle section one-two of the Shijiao Commentary, it extensively clarifies that precepts are the foundation of concentration and wisdom, therefore it begins by praising the purport of vinaya. Also, in lower section four-one, it quotes the Buddha Treasury to show that after five summers, one should study selflessness and entry into dharma. This volume frequently clarifies that equal cultivation of the three studies is what renunciants should properly study. And so on. The Pure Mind Admonishing Contemplation earnestly encourages the cultivation of the three studies equally. At age twenty, Nanshan listened to the vinaya once and immediately wanted to practice meditation, but his teacher said he must listen twenty times. Later he withdrew to Zhanggu Valley in Zhongnan Mountain, sitting in meditation for several years, frequently experiencing spiritual phenomena. Soon he moved to Chongyi Temple in Jingzhao, constantly receiving heavenly offerings, practicing the pratyutpanna samādhi, with groups of dragons transforming into humans to pay respects. He cultivated this samādhi for twenty sessions. During the Yonghui period he dwelt in seclusion at Zhuma Forest practicing meditation. In the first year of Xianqing, Emperor Gaozong established Ximing Temple and issued an edict appointing the master as first seat. The master declined and would not rise. The emperor pressed more earnestly but the master reluctantly accepted the appointment. He lectured on the Laṅkāvatāra at Jingye Temple, with dragons transforming into humans to listen secretly. The master also received protection from heavenly beings. That the master devoted his mind to the path of concentration and wisdom can be observed. Carefully examining the postscript to the Precept Commentary, this master's intention to revive the orthodox school of equal cultivation of the three studies, and also to cut away the obstructions of scholastic study of names and characteristics and the obstructions of trivial vinaya study in order to develop the great path, is brilliantly clear. The ten sections of the Shijiao Commentary frequently point out this purport. Thinking about this, Nanshan's composition of commentaries on the vinaya section was to enable students to save effort in studying vinaya and quickly approach the gate of concentration and wisdom. It was definitely not one-sidedly grasping vinaya while praising vinaya. Question: Why does our school rely on the Dharmaguptaka and

【Sixty-sixth Page Lower Section】
not rely on other schools? Answer: The reasons for adoption and rejection generally have three meanings. First, the Dharmaguptaka school has order in persons and dharmas, extensive regulatory applications, clear and concise doctrinal establishment, diverse methods of guidance, and simple and convenient practices - having such advantages. Second, because this vinaya is comprehensively penetrating and partially connected to Mahāyāna, it can adapt to contemporary circumstances. Third, because since ancient times China has been unified in receiving precepts based on the Dharmaguptaka. Having these various principles, the Dharmaguptaka is taken as the foundation. Moreover, "partially connected to Mahāyāna" reveals one aspect of gradual entry into Mahāyāna. Considering that when the Tathāgata was in the world, he used the three dharma collections to explain the three training grounds, definitively without multiple paths. There were only great bodhisattvas dwelling in inconceivable liberation, great arhats of vast wisdom, and the eight classes of gods and dragons dwelling in samādhi who were privileged to hear the Mahāyāna secrets. This was not something ordinary foolish beings could fathom. The five masters of different periods still inherited that correct track, only transmitting the three collections without different paths. After Mādhyantika, sectarian divisions arose, emotional views crossed paths, exclusively attacking dregs while being ignorant of the sage's intention, finally reaching the point of not knowing that the Tathāgata had Mahāyāna secrets. Therefore Venerable Fazhen slightly leaked the secret intention, clearly revealing that the śrāvaka vehicle is precisely the expedient means of Mahāyāna. The transmitted vinaya was named Dharmaguptaka, whereby the five meanings partially connect to Mahāyāna. Though this differs from previous sages, it conversely can adapt to contemporary circumstances and expound the sage's intention. Though Nanshan deeply admired the pure transformation of the five masters of different periods, he was also able to discern that contemporary times were declining and corrupt, with people's capacities mostly pursuing the lofty, subtle, vast and great, making it unsuitable to purely advocate the ancient path. For vinaya he relied on the Dharmaguptaka while also incorporating Mahāyāna vinaya; for teachings he extensively relied on the teachings of one lifetime to universally save all capacities. To summarize the essentials: the so-called emptiness of nature, emptiness of characteristics, and consciousness-only. How marvelous is this doctrinal aim!

It comprehensively embraces the three collections and the Mahāyāna collection, fully according with the pure transformation of the true dharma when Buddha was in the world. It can be called the skillful hand that upholds the banner of true dharma. Someone asks: In Nanshan's commentaries, when clarifying the three contemplations and three schools, he takes the consciousness-only perfect school as the ultimate doctrine, sometimes saying "from the stage of aspiration and practice," sometimes saying "penetrating the four stages." This seems to permit ordinary beings to directly study the perfect school. Why now say that our school takes vinaya as foundation and also speaks of gradual entry into Mahāyāna as the correct track of the doctrine? Answer: In the commentaries, when dividing teachings and establishing doctrine, whether based on transformation and practice or based on the three wheels, vinaya is taken as foundation. Never has it said consciousness-only, etc. This is clear evidence that our school takes vinaya as foundation. The arrangement of three contemplations and three schools is merely highlighting the distinctions of exhausting principle and embracing capacities within the three studies' practice gates. It is not the meaning of taking consciousness-only middle way as foundation. Saying "from the stage of aspiration" or "penetrating four stages" refers to texts clarifying the direct path. When our school reveals the teaching-path of one transformation in Jambudvīpa, it necessarily takes turning the mind as the correct track. When reaching the gate of exhausting principle and embracing capacities, it clarifies all three vehicles concurrently. Within Mahāyāna, both direct path and mind-turning are included as those being taught. However, the patriarch's intention held that the direct path is extremely difficult to enter, therefore frequently warning against reckless study. In the novice section of the Shijiao Commentary, after listing Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna, it says: "Provisionally dividing the two vehicles of great and small, we briefly know the routes. But similar paths and similar goods are difficult to know and difficult to study, often entering deviant forests. Logically one should study comprehensively to be capable of correct contemplation. One should not take recitation as the path-practice. As explained in the Daśabhūmika Vibhāṣā and the Ten Grounds." The sutra also says: "Through much learning one gains wisdom, therefore entering the true dharma. One cannot study suddenly, just like the great ocean." Also using three matters to

examine the three paths. Ordinary beings act only for themselves; the two vehicles act for themselves and also for others; Mahāyāna acts only for others. Because these three motivations differ, the fruits achieved also differ. If discussing conditional matters, though minds diverge, actions are the same. Just knowing the general outline suffices. These various texts all show that ordinary beings should not rashly study Mahāyāna, as can be known. Question: How do the similarities and differences compare between Nanshan's so-called consciousness-only and what the Cien school established? Answer: Their great principle of consciousness-only without external objects is similar, but where their meanings lead is vastly different. Why? Our school opens and proclaims tathāgatagarbha dependent origination, the dual integration of conventional and ultimate truth, equality of one nature, permanently abiding buddha-nature, etc., harmonizing with the ultimate meaning of Avataṃsaka, Prajñāpāramitā, Lotus, and Nirvāṇa sūtras. It is not the same as the consciousness-only established by the Cien school, as should be known. Fourth, regarding root and branch: Even secular classics say "things have root and branch, affairs have beginning and end." They also say "the gentleman focuses on the root; when the root is established, the path is accomplished." How much more so for the great path of transcending the world! Those who grasp the root while abandoning the branch - this is inadvisable. Those who grasp the branch while abandoning the root - this is also inadvisable. Only by embracing both root and branch does one achieve the refined great path. However, those who prioritize the root while relaxing the branch are still acceptable within the inadvisable. Those who attack the branch while neglecting the root - this is inadvisable within the inadvisable. Therefore, those unable to practice both root and branch must focus on the root while minimizing the branch. An ancient said: "Deeply seeking meditative liberation and illuminating through the root of birth and death, then worry, fear, lust and anger have no place to plant their feet. Simply wither the root and the branches and leaves naturally decay." This is supreme discourse. However, among those studying vinaya in the final age, there are occasionally those who practice only the branch of branches while forgetting the root of roots, busily analyzing trivial affairs and being constrained by trivial matters like deportment and purity maintenance.

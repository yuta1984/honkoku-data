It is exactly like adding water to sell milk. They consider themselves to be protecting the dharma and supporting their school, but they do not realize that their explanations that elevate themselves while denigrating others, by revering attachment, naturally make their reasoning biased. Gradually this erodes the path of centrality and correctness. At first glance it appears to support the patriarchal traditions, but in reality it is a sharp axe that cuts down the true dharma. Therefore, in this degenerate age, those who aspire to study the Way should deeply investigate the doctrinal sources of all schools, discard their corruptions and adopt their strengths, and steadfastly maintain understanding and practice. Otherwise, they will inevitably mistake pottery shards for precious jade and become objects of ridicule by the wise. Their corruptions will be discussed at the appropriate time. For now, I will simply raise the six Mahāyāna schools and discuss their strengths, to serve as a guide for scholars in choosing the dharma.

The reason I now raise only the six schools without discussing the other four traditions will be clarified at the appropriate time.

That which opens and proclaims the great school of dharma-nature origination, where principle reaches the ultimate of cause and effect, expands the five-fold dharma realm, divides teachings into universal and particular, manifests the mysterious plan of the One Vehicle, uses the two emptinesses and three natures to solidify the foundation, uses the ten mysteries and six characteristics to adorn the towers and pavilions, and with vast pristine standards accurately points to Vairocana's great transformation of governing the dharma realm - this is most intimately found in the essential teaching of the three Huayan patriarchs. As for the three truths raising the guidelines and spreading all details in the four siddhāntas, one mind holding the balance and arranging a thousand stars in the ten vehicles, clarifying both provisional and ultimate, nearly exhausting the realm of teaching, practice, cause and effect, benefiting both sharp and dull faculties, thus avoiding the fault of arrogance and self-limitation - what has gathered this great achievement since the existence of Buddha-dharma, what all schools can take as their mirror, what ten thousand generations can take as their standard, is most completely found in the explanations of Great Master Zhiyi.

Question: Each school has its own family dharma - why do you say that what the Wise One explained is the mirror for all schools? Answer: If those of superior root-nature with mature good roots find their own school sufficient, why would they need to borrow from others? However, those of middle and lower streams with thin and few good roots are mostly hasty and superficially exposed, with dharma following emotional nests. When emotional understanding becomes primary, correct wisdom becomes attachment and becomes stagnant. Unless one first studies Tiantai teachings to distinguish the mysterious plan of truth-contemplation and the great standards of vehicle-teachings before studying their own school, the worthy will be enchanted by wisdom and the unworthy will be strangled by ignorance. If one does not mistake thieves for sons, one will surely become like someone who carries hemp while discarding gold. Lingzhi said: "If one wishes to clarify one's own mind, accurately point to the wondrous realm, distinguish between great and small, refine the partial and perfect, understand the shallow and deep positions and the sequence of approaching the Way, only the Mahā-śamatha-vipaśyanā can be trusted with one's heart." These words have meaning. I privately think that the Lotus Sutra's Mysterious Meaning is the standard for studying Buddhism.

As for borrowing worldly conditioned phenomena to metaphorically explain formless wondrous characteristics, manifesting dharma-realm nature, using the skillful means of complete mantra practice to purify afflictions and false attachments, awakening to great emptiness-birth, the four-fold maṇḍalas revealing Vairocana's secret treasury, the three kinds of wondrous precepts embracing Vajrasattva's vow-practices, stirring the vastness of the nature-ocean to expand the waves of dependent origination - this is most completely found in the explanations of the Mahāvairocana Sūtra Commentary.

Question: What you present here differs considerably from what modern esoteric practitioners say - why? Answer: This meaning cannot be easily explained. It will be clarified at the appropriate time.

That which borrows one black path to connect with the true pulse of dhyāna, grasps the stainless iron hammer to destroy the prison barriers of the skandhas and āyatanas, skillfully applies standards and measures to preserve the true atmosphere of the śramaṇa family in the age of semblance and final dharma - this is most wonderful in the directly-pointing Way of Shaolin.

Someone asks: Your veneration of the Chan school - does it differ considerably from how Chan practitioners venerate the Chan school? Answer: Indeed it does. What modern Chan practitioners boast of as Chan is precisely the mind-nature of sentient beings and the dharma-body of all buddhas. The Tiantai, Xianshou, and esoteric Tripiṭaka schools all take this as their foundation. Like Abhidharma, Satyasiddhi, Yogācāra, Madhyamaka and others - when one exhaustively discusses principle, none do not take this as their destination. Therefore, what ordinary Chan practitioners boast of as Chan is the Tathāgata-garbha mind that all schools depend upon, not something that the Chan school alone possesses. When others say "all schools each depend on one sūtra while the Chan school does not partially depend on one sūtra - the schools are particular while Chan is comprehensive" - this too is incorrect. Why? Depending on one sūtra refers to the gateway and relative aspects. If we consider gateways, even within the Chan school there are differences: some practice constant polishing, some hold to "originally nothing there." Some seal the mind with the Laṅkāvatāra, some seal the mind with the Diamond Sūtra. Some have three mysteries and three essentials, some have five ranks of lord and minister. How can one say there are no distinctions? If we consider the inner sanctum and discuss the absolute, the so-called Huayan, Tiantai, esoteric schools etc. each comprehensively embrace all inexhaustible teachings and meanings of the ten directions and three times without excess or deficiency. What distinctions could there be? Viewing it this way, what ordinary Chan practitioners boast and glorify as Chan is the

common foundation of all schools, not something possessed by the Chan school alone. Why venerate what they venerate? However, my reasons for venerating the Chan school - let me now raise two or three points.

The First Patriarch showed Shenguang, saying: "If you externally cease all conditions, internally have no panting mind, and make your mind like a wall, you can enter the Way." Zhaozhou said: "I was in the south for thirty years, except for the two meal times, there was no place for scattered mind-use (and so forth)." Xianglin took forty years to finally achieve one piece; Yongquan still ran about doing tasks after forty years. Also, Shishuang showed people: "Rest and stop, cease and desist, be like cold ashes and withered trees, like incense burners in ancient temples, like one white silk strip, like one thought lasting ten thousand years." These are the correct tracks of true participation and real cultivation for the unawakened. It's not only Chan practitioners who have this cultivation - all students of the three vehicles and one vehicle who receive Śākyamuni's true transformation should borrow such cultivation as the essential for entering principle. But in the age of semblance dharma, people and dharma gradually deteriorate. Those who study teachings and practice vinaya busily cling to names and characteristics; those who cultivate Chan wander about sunk in predetermined notions. It's exactly like climbing Mount Kunlun to collect dirt clods. Shaolin lamented this corrupt custom and exercised that wonderful hand to cut off side-views and branching paths, directly showing the royal road of sages and worthies, wanting to make students recover their own originally bright true mind from the dens of skandhas and āyatanas. This is why I venerate the Chan school. Moreover, the monastic regulations of that school roughly attain the general framework of vinaya restraint. Even tiny novice monks generally take delight in borrowing Chan contemplation to investigate their own mind-nature. This is the true atmosphere of śramaṇas in Śākyamuni's single transformation. This too is what I

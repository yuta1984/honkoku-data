The six sense organs. Sixth is contact, referring to being able to respond to the superiority or inferiority of objects. Seventh is feeling, referring to being able to receive the suffering or pleasure of objects. Eighth is craving, referring to attachment to the three realms. Ninth is grasping, referring to afflictions. Tenth is existence - when the seeds of the six links from formations to feeling are moistened by craving and grasping, they can have future existence. Eleventh is birth, referring to the manifestation of suffering results. Twelfth is old age and death, referring to decline, change, and final disappearance. The World-Honored One thus established these as expedient means to enable pratyekabuddhas and others to attain self-enlightenment. But they did not understand and falsely clung to the existence of real defiled and pure dependent origination. Now explaining their non-existence to make them abandon attachments. Regarding defiled categories, it only explains from "no ignorance" to "no old age and death." Regarding pure categories, it only explains from "no extinction of ignorance" to "no extinction of old age and death." Each merely negates the forward [sequence], while also exemplifying the non-existence of the reverse. Raising the non-existence of beginning and end to exemplify that the middle is also non-existent.

The sutra states: "No suffering, origination, cessation, path." Commentary: Previously negating the close observation of pratyekabudhas, this negates the close observation of śrāvakas - namely the Four Noble Truths. Contaminated oppression is called suffering; attracting and sensing future existence is called origination; the four types of nirvana are called cessation; uncontaminated conditioned [factors] are called path. Like one treating illness who knows disease, disease cause, disease elimination, and elimination method - observing birth-and-death suffering, suffering cause, suffering cessation, and cessation method is the same. Only the noble ones know reality, hence called Noble Truths. Among what is not suffering etc., what the Buddha explained as suffering etc., the śrāvakas and others did not understand and arose attachment according to the words. Now breaking their attachments, therefore explaining non-existence. The dependent nature is definitely not the characteristics of suffering, origination, etc. How could true principle have such distinctions? Therefore all are non-existent.

The sutra states: "No wisdom and also no attainment." Commentary: Above negated the close observation of śrāvakas; this negates the close observation of bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas' true observation is only non-conceptual. Therefore generally explaining the close [observation], also without wisdom or attainment. Non-discriminative

wisdom, when realizing true suchness, mind and object merge mysteriously in equality. Grasper and grasped are all completely absent. In subsequently-attained wisdom, free from the bondage of various characteristics, without false attachments, also free from the two graspings. Since the seeds of attachment in other stages are not yet eliminated, observation is not clear and there are said to be two graspings. Breaking real grasper, therefore explaining "no wisdom." Breaking real grasped, again saying "no attainment."

The sutra states: "Because there is nothing to be obtained." Commentary: Bodhisattvas properly cultivate the ten skillful observations. Through Śāriputra gradually awakening to the Mahāyāna, therefore this together negates the six types of the three vehicles - general and particular, near and far, preparatory and fundamental. In the two true observation stages, realizing the phenomena and principle of dharmas, the six characteristics of attachment are completely non-existent. Dependent and perfected [natures] are not definitely the six characteristics. Therefore using "nothing to be obtained" to comprehensively explain the above negations. As the great sutra says: Form and other dharmas, because of having nothing to be obtained, profound prajñā also has nothing to be obtained.

The sutra states: "Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, because of relying on prajñāpāramitā, have no mental obstructions; because there are no obstructions, they have no fear; departing from all inversions and dream-thinking, they ultimately [attain] nirvana." Commentary: Below clarifies the virtues of relying on study, praising the attainment of benefits, leaving suffering and perfectly realizing. This praises the cultivation benefits of bodhisattvas in the causal stage. Bodhisattvas constantly condition themselves on the explained words and letters, learning to arise contemplative illumination, seeking to observe true characteristics, cultivating and maintaining retinues, not falsely seeking to know all object-realms - this is called relying on prajñā. Obstruction refers to afflictive obstructions - not attaining nirvana. Obstruction refers to cognitive obstructions - not attaining bodhi. Or obstruction is precisely obstruction, both comprehending the two obstructions. Fear refers to five fearfulnesses: first, fear of not living; second, fear of bad reputation; third, fear of death; fourth, fear of evil destinies; fifth, fear of assemblies. Inversions refer to seven inversions: first, perceptual inversion; second, view inversion; third, mental inversion;

**Page Nine, Upper Section**

Fourth, regarding impermanence as permanence; fifth, regarding suffering as pleasure; sixth, regarding impurity as purity; seventh, regarding no-self as self. Dream-thinking means that true wisdom has not yet awakened, constantly dwelling in dreams. Through this the Buddha spoke of the long night of birth and death. Dreams arise from conceptualization, therefore called dream-thinking. The previous seven inversions arise from false conceptualization, acting while in dreams, therefore called dream-thinking. In Sanskrit "nirvana," in Chinese "perfect tranquility" - meaning the essence is all-pervading and the nature is pristinely clear. Speaking generally here: because various bodhisattvas rely on prajñā, they awaken to the three non-natures and, through the emptiness revealed by the two emptinesses of self and dharma, their minds are not obstructed by the two obstructions, not frightened by the five fears, not entangled by the seven inversions, not deluded by dream-thinking, and can ultimately realize and directly experience nirvana.

The sutra states: "Buddhas of the three times, because of relying on prajñāpāramitā, attain anuttarā-samyak-sambodhi." Commentary: The three times are past, future, and present. "All" means not just one. In Sanskrit "buddha," abbreviated as "buddha," in Chinese "awakened one." "Attain" means to achieve and realize. "A" means "no," "nuttarā" means "superior," "samyak" means "correct," "sam" means "equal," "sam" again means "correct," "bodhi" means "awakening." Emerging from birth and death with wisdom and practice both fulfilled, labeled with the name Buddha. Awakened wisdom is perfectly complete - though there is no more cultivation, it is sustained without abandoning, benefiting sentient beings, therefore it also explains that Buddha relies on prajñā. Or "rely" means "cultivate." Because Buddha, through the causal stage of practicing and relying on prajñā, attained correct awakening. Wisdom and elimination [of obstructions] are perfectly complete, called "unsurpassed awakening." Distinguishing from the false wisdom of ordinary beings, it's called "correct awakening." Distinguishing from the partial wisdom of the two vehicles, it's called "equal awakening." Distinguishing from the incomplete wisdom of bodhisattvas, it's again called "correct awakening." Only Buddha

perfectly realizes and obtains the complete name.

The sutra states: "Therefore know that prajñāpāramitā is the great spiritual mantra, is the great bright mantra, is the unsurpassed mantra, is the unequaled mantra." Commentary: In Sanskrit "dhāraṇī," this is called "total retention." There are briefly four types: First is dharma - using brief teachings to contain the extensive. Second is meaning - using brief meaning to contain the extensive. Third is being able to attain the bodhisattva's acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas, as Maitreya explained: [Sanskrit mantra]. Fourth is mantra, as the great sutra explains: [Sanskrit mantra]. Mindfulness and wisdom, these two can completely contain myriad virtues. Following this ancient explanation, generally establishing the name "mantra." Through total retention surpassing the four paths of ordinary beings, śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas, or through the wonderful function of written words, the perfect reflection of contemplative illumination, the supreme benefits of retinue, and the incomparable true characteristics - or all four are comprehensive. Therefore this prajñā is called the spiritual and other mantras. Or this prajñā is the mantra spoken by the great spiritual one up to the unequaled one. Encouraging all students to cultivate the ten dharma practices regarding this sutra.

The sutra states: "Able to eliminate all suffering." Commentary: Previously clarifying having virtue, this clarifies breaking evil. Faith, study, realization, and explanation all eliminate multitudinous sufferings. Therefore the great sutra says: Being able to practice the ten dharma practices regarding this sutra, all obstructive coverings cannot defile; though creating all extremely heavy evil karma, one can transcend all evil destinies, up to quickly realizing unsurpassed bodhi. According to the mind's desires, nothing fails to be accomplished. Therefore, the four assemblies of the royal city barely recited and remembered to subdue demons; the thousand-eyed [deity] of the celestial palace just began accepting and maintaining when

enemies were defeated. How much more when deeply compassionating oneself earnestly, with causes perfected and results complete - not extracting from the five destinies to be teacher, striding across the ten directions to be master - this has never existed.

The sutra states: "True and real, not false." Commentary: To remove doubt and encourage faith, this statement is repeated. How could one abandon the position of great wheel-turning king, dwell in quiet forests and remove adornments, claim the honor of compassionate father and dharma king, tread all paths and raise up reputation, face various dragon-elephants, guide those devas and humans, and deceive and entice living beings? This would truly be impermissible. Therefore the sutra says: "The Tathāgata is one who speaks truthfully... up to one who speaks consistently." Therefore one should have faith and reverence, and not arise alarm or doubt.

The sutra states: "Therefore the prajñāpāramitā mantra is spoken, namely: gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā." Commentary: Previously explaining dharma-meaning retention, though encouraging faith and study, wanting to quickly prepare spiritual functions, additionally explaining mantra retention. Ximming says: The phrases "gate" etc. have been traditionally transmitted - this mantra is the correct pronunciation of the Western Regions, with secret words and phrases. Translation would lose its efficacy, therefore the Sanskrit is preserved. Also, in explaining mantras, various sacred names are spoken, or demon and spirit names, or the profound meanings of various dharmas. The words contain multiple meanings with no exact correspondence, therefore the Sanskrit pronunciation is preserved. One interpretation: "gate gate" means "cross over, cross over," extolling the previous prose's two characters "prajñā." This shows prajñā has great power - crossing over oneself and crossing over others, therefore saying "cross over, cross over." Next, "pāra" means "reaching the other shore," extolling the prose's "pāramitā." Though saying "cross over, cross over," but crossing over to where? Namely the other shore is the place of crossing over. Therefore saying "pāragate." Next "pāra" is as above. "Saṃgate" means

**Page Ten, Lower Section**

"completely arrived," extolling the prose's two characters "ultimate." Next "bodhi" means "awakening" - namely the essence of the other shore. Next "svāhā" means "swiftly." Through wonderful wisdom having supreme function, one can swiftly reach the shore of bodhi. Master Kūkai says: The first "gate" manifests the practices and results of śrāvakas; the second "gate" indicates the practices and results of pratyekabuddhas; the third "pāragate" points to the supreme practices and results of the great vehicle; the fourth "pārasaṃgate" clarifies the practices and results of the complete wheel-circle of mantra-maṇḍala; the fifth "bodhi svāhā" explains the meaning of ultimate bodhi realization and entry of all the above vehicles. The Secret Treasury Record says: "gate gate" (meaning practices - namely bodhisattva practices, buddha practices); "pāra" (meaning perfect and supreme); "gate pārasaṃ" (meaning harmony); "gate bodhi svāhā" (meaning ultimate, perfect, awakening, accomplishment, and profound mystery). Now I say: Though there are two or three schools interpreting the meanings of characters and phrases, since Master Cien did not interpret them, it's clear that secret explanations don't require explicit interpretation. The meaning of the phrases may be so, but it's difficult to fathom.

These bodhisattvas can also transform all sentient beings, already able to transcend the conceptions of self, person, perceiver, sentient beings, etc., and the inverted conceptions of heterodox paths that cannot be harbored—Third, clarifying the function of middle forbearance. Because they observe the five aggregates as without self, they have already transcended conceptions of self, person, etc. Because they observe the cause and effect of three times as neither permanent nor断, heterodox paths etc. cannot destroy or harbor [wrong views]. The position is the ten practices.

Furthermore, there are the ten path-seed nature grounds: namely observing form, consciousness, perception, feeling, formations to attain forbearance of precepts, forbearance of right view, forbearance of concentration, forbearance of wisdom, forbearance of liberation; observing the emptiness forbearance of three realms' cause and effect, wishless forbearance, signless forbearance; observing the two truths' reality and illusion, all dharmas' impermanence is called impermanence forbearance; all dharmas being empty attains non-arising forbearance. These are the bodhisattva's ten firm minds—Third, path-seed nature is upper forbearance. The position is ten dedications. The three-section differentiation within follows the above. The ten firm minds are as in the text. The first five are the divisions of dharma-body. The next three are emptiness forbearance; through the two truths and all dharmas being empty, attaining naturelessness forbearance, etc. These are the bodhisattva's self-benefit virtues.

Becoming wheel-turning kings, they can also transform the four continents, generating good roots in all sentient beings—This clarifies the characteristics of transforming others. Among the four kinds of wheel-turning kings, now referring to golden wheels ruling the four continents. According to the text below, superior ten wholesome acts are iron wheel kings transforming one Jambudvīpa. Habitual seeds are copper wheel kings transforming two continents, excluding the northeast. Nature seeds are silver wheels transforming three heavens, excluding the north. Iron is the one continent of southern Jambudvīpa.

Also, faith forbearance bodhisattvas, namely practitioners of good, penetration, and clarity—From below explaining the three positions of faith forbearance bodhisattvas, there are four aspects. First expressing the names. Next, from "namely" below, presenting the virtues of faith forbearance. From "severing the three realms" below is severing obstructions. From "able to transform a hundred buddhas" below clarifies the transformed buddha-lands. From "constantly using fifteen minds" below arouses superior cultivation. Within this

Good means good-awakening forbearance, positioned at the first ground. Penetration means contemplative-penetration forbearance, positioned at the second ground. Clarity means clear-wisdom forbearance, positioned at the third ground.

Severing the bondage of form-afflictions in the three realms—The first, second, and third grounds observe form-truth as signless, not grasping or clinging to form-dharmas. Hence they are freed from form-bondage. Also observing mind-truth has hidden and manifest aspects in the text.

Able to transform among a hundred buddha-《split writing: [margin note] first｜ground》 thousand buddha-《split writing: [margin note] second｜ground》 ten thousand buddha-《split writing: [margin note] third｜ground》 lands, manifesting a hundred bodies《split writing: [note] first｜ground》 thousand bodies《split writing: [margin note] second｜ground》 ten thousand bodies《split writing: [margin note] third｜ground》 of spiritual powers, immeasurable merits—Third, clarifying the transformed buddha-lands. According to the Ground Sutra, the first ground transforms a hundred buddha-worlds, the second ground transforms a thousand buddha-worlds, the third ground transforms ten thousand buddha-worlds. Manifesting bodies is likewise.

Constantly using fifteen minds as the foundation: four methods of attraction, four immeasurable minds, four great vows, three liberation gates—these bodhisattvas from the good-awakening ground to sarvajñā use these fifteen minds as the fundamental seeds of all practices—Fourth, arousing superior cultivation. The four methods of attraction are: giving, kind words, beneficial action, shared work. The four immeasurable minds are: loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity. Loving-kindness is the mind that gives happiness; compassion is the mind that removes suffering; joy is the mind that celebrates beings; equanimity is the mind of equality. Because the conditioned realms are unlimited, they are called immeasurable. The four great vows are as usual. The three liberations are: first, wishlessness can reject birth-and-death; second, signlessness can show nirvana; third, emptiness concentration observes that both birth-and-death and nirvana lack characteristics.《split writing: etc.》

Also, compliance forbearance bodhisattvas, namely seeing, victory, manifest dharma—From below clarifying the three positions of compliance forbearance. The four aspects of the text follow the above. Seeing is the fourth flaming-wisdom ground, called flaming-wisdom forbearance. Victory is the fifth extremely-difficult-to-conquer ground, called victory-

wisdom forbearance. Manifest dharma is the sixth manifest-presence ground, called manifest-dharma forbearance.

Able to sever the bondage of mind and other afflictions in the three realms—These three grounds observe mind-truth as signless, not grasping mind-characteristics, knowing mind as non-arising. Hence they can sever afflictions that delude about mind. Following the above regarding form.

Manifesting one body in buddha-lands of the ten directions, with immeasurable, ineffable spiritual powers transforming sentient beings—Fourth, clarifying the transformed buddha-lands. According to the Ground Sutra, flaming-ground bodhisattvas can manifest one hundred million bodies, able to transform sentient beings in one hundred million buddha-lands, etc. Difficult-to-conquer ground bodhisattvas can manifest one thousand billion bodies, transforming sentient beings in one thousand billion worlds, etc. Manifest-presence ground manifests one hundred thousand billion bodies transforming sentient beings.《split writing: etc.》 This is stated according to stages and positions. In the case of vow-wisdom results, all cannot be calculated or known. According to this sutra text, the fourth ground becomes Tuṣita heaven king, the fifth ground becomes other-transformation heaven king, the sixth ground becomes joyful-transformation heaven king. If following the sequence of six heavens, the fifth ground should be joyful-transformation heaven. Perhaps an error in the text.

Also, non-arising forbearance bodhisattvas, namely far, immovable, contemplative wisdom—Fourth, clarifying the three positions of non-arising forbearance. Within this, expressing names, presenting positions, obstructions, manifested lands in four sections follows the above. Within this, "far" is the far-going ground, called far-reaching forbearance, the seventh ground. "Immovable" is the immovable ground, equal-contemplation forbearance《split writing: etc.》 the eighth ground. "Contemplative wisdom" is the good-wisdom ground, wisdom-light forbearance《split writing: etc.》 the ninth ground.

Also severing the habitual afflictions of mind, form, etc. in the three realms—Clarifying treatment of obstructions. These three positions deeply realize the non-arising of mind and form. Hence they can sever the habits of form and mind—consider this.

Manifesting ineffable, ineffable merit and spiritual powers—This clarifies manifested lands. According to the Ground Sutra, the seventh ground

Second, from "I now" below praises the benefits of the teaching. In the comparison section, it praises Moon Light's explained merit as being like the water of a great ocean. The bodhisattva of the tenth ground's explanation is like one drop of the ocean. Another interpretation: Not so. Moon Light's explanation is like one drop of the ocean, while the tenth ground bodhisattva's explanation is like the water of a great ocean, because this is superior.

In the second section on benefits, there are three parts. First, from "I now" below, regarding Śākyamuni's explanation, it clarifies that Moon Light's teaching truly benefits sentient beings. From "past-future-present" below, regarding the three-time buddhas, it states approval. Third, from "three worthies" below, regarding the forty worthies and sages, it praises Moon Light King's partial-meaning merit. The comparison is complete.

Good sons, these fourteen dharma-gates are what all sentient beings of the three times and all buddhas of the three times cultivate. Future buddhas are also thus. If all buddhas and bodhisattvas did not attain sarvajna through these gates, this would be impossible. Why? Because all buddhas and bodhisattvas have no different path.

From "Good sons, these fourteen dharma-gates" below, major section five quotes the above explanations and concludes by encouraging cultivation. Within this are three parts. First, clarifying that the three times practice together, revealing the supreme excellence of practice. Second, from "if someone hears" below, praising benefits and encouraging cultivation. Third, from "at that time among the assembly, ten billion" below, clarifying obtaining benefits from hearing the teaching. In the first section revealing supreme practice excellence, there are two parts. First, correctly clarifying that the three times practice together and realize together. Second, from "if all buddhas and bodhisattvas do not depend on" below, clarifying the reason for the above shared practice and realization. Third, from "why?" below, explaining the meaning of the above shared practice—because there is no different path. From "if someone hears" below, the second praises benefits and encourages cultivation. Within this are two parts. First, further listing the names of the fourteen forbearances. Second, from "this person transcends" below, praising the sutra's efficacious power.

Therefore, all good sons, if someone hears these forbearance dharma-gates—faith forbearance, stopping forbearance, firm forbearance, good awakening forbearance, separation-penetration forbearance, bright wisdom forbearance, flame wisdom forbearance, supreme wisdom forbearance, dharma-manifestation forbearance, far-penetration forbearance, equal awakening forbearance, wisdom-light forbearance, consecration forbearance, perfect awakening forbearance—

First listing the names of the fourteen forbearances. First, faith forbearance means the habit-seed nature. Second, stopping forbearance means the inherent-seed nature. Third, firm forbearance means the path-seed nature. Fourth, good awakening forbearance means the first ground. Fifth, separation-penetration forbearance means the second ground. Sixth, bright wisdom forbearance means the third ground. Seventh, flame wisdom forbearance means the fourth ground. Eighth, supreme wisdom forbearance means the fifth ground. Ninth, dharma-manifestation forbearance means the sixth ground. Tenth, far-penetration forbearance means the seventh ground. Eleventh, equal awakening forbearance means the eighth ground. Twelfth, wisdom-light forbearance means the ninth ground. Thirteenth, consecration forbearance means the tenth ground. Fourteenth, perfect awakening forbearance means the buddha ground—the Tathagata's ten thousand virtues.

This person transcends hundreds of kalpas, thousands of kalpas, immeasurable Ganges-sand lifetimes of suffering and difficulty, enters this dharma-gate, and obtains reward in the present body.

The commentary says: From "this person transcends" below, the second clarifies praising the sutra's efficacious power.

At that time in the assembly there were ten billion bodhisattvas with the same name Ākāśagarbha-sāgara, rejoicing in dharma-bliss, each scattering flowers in empty space, transforming into immeasurable flower platforms with immeasurable great assemblies above explaining the fourteen correct practices. The eighteen Brahmā and six desire-realm heavenly kings also scattered jeweled flowers, each sitting on empty-space platforms explaining the fourteen correct practices, upholding, reading, reciting, and understanding their meaning and principle. Immeasurable ghosts and spirits manifested bodies to cultivate prajñāpāramitā.

The commentary says: From "at that time the various" below, the great assembly heard the dharma, obtained benefits, and scattered flowers in offering. The text has three parts. First, bodhisattvas' joyful offering. The fourteen forbearances are called the fourteen correct practices. Second, eighteen Brahmā heavens' joyful offering. Third, from "immeasurable ghosts and spirits" below, clarifying ghosts and spirits' offerings. It briefly does not clarify other assemblies' offerings.

Speaking of "eighteen Brahmā" means: The first dhyāna has three—first Brahmā-retinue, second Brahmā-ministers, third Great Brahmā. The second dhyāna has three—first Lesser Light, second Immeasurable, third Light-Sound. The third dhyāna has three—first Lesser Purity, second Universal Purity, third Immeasurable Purity. The fourth dhyāna has nine: first Merit-Birth, second Merit-Cloud, third Vast Fruit. These three heavens are dwelt in by both ordinary beings and sages. Fourth, the Unconscious Heaven is dwelt in only by non-Buddhist ordinary beings. Fifth Cloudless, sixth Heatless, seventh Good Appearance, eighth Good Vision, ninth Form Ultimate—these five are dwelt in only by non-returners and other sages. Only the fourth dhyāna has nine grounds, hence called "eighteen Brahmā." The formless realm is not mentioned.

Speaking of "ghosts and spirits manifesting bodies to practice" means because of their past cultivation of reverence, they are enabled to cultivate prajñā, and because they destroyed precepts, they follow among ghosts. This completes answering the second question, clarifying the characteristics of benefiting others.

The Buddha told the great king: "You previously asked, 'How can sentient being characteristics be transformed?' If with an illusory transformation body one sees illusory transformation, this is a bodhisattva truly practicing transformation of sentient beings."

The commentary says: The third, "The Buddha told the great king, you previously said" below answers the previous question about sentient beings to be transformed. The text has three parts. First, wanting to answer, it quotes the question, hence saying "How can sentient being characteristics be transformed?" Second, from "if illusory transformation" below gives the correct answer. Third, from "at that time the assembly" below clarifies obtaining benefits. In the correct answer are two parts. First, answering in terms of awakening-entry, also called brief answer, also called answering in terms of no-attainment. The text says "If with illusory transformation one truly practices transforming sentient beings." If one knows bodily characteristics are fundamentally unborn, for the sake of transforming sentient beings it is called "illusory transformer." Sentient beings fundamentally do not exist, yet now speaking of transformation—because of being non-existent yet existing, it is called "seeing illusory transformation." Knowing that the transformer and the transformed are fundamentally pure, hence saying "truly practicing transformation of sentient beings."

The initial single moment of sentient beings' consciousness differs from wood and stone.

The commentary says: From "sentient beings' consciousness initial single moment" below is the second extensive answer. Also called answering in terms of arising-function, also called answering in terms of conventional truth and existence. The text has five parts. First, determining that good and evil mind differs from wood and stone. Second, from "form called form-covering" below presents the names of the five aggregates. Third, from "covering means" below clarifies that all dharmas belong to conventional truth. First saying "sentient beings' consciousness initial single moment consciousness differs from wood and stone—innate good, innate evil, evil becomes the root of immeasurable evil consciousness up to hell, good becomes the root of immeasurable good consciousness up to vajra bodhisattvas." Interpreters differ; I cannot present all views. Now I will interpret according to the sutra. The Nirvana Sutra says: Like the medicine of Snow Mountain, being thus one flavor, following its flowing places there are various flavors. Remaining in the mountain is like the full moon. The combined analogy says "one flavor" represents buddha-nature; because of afflictions, various flavors arise—namely hell, animals, etc. Now "one flavor" means precisely the no-attainment, non-dual true nature. Again saying: Being thus one flavor yet following its flowing places having various different flavors means depending on the no-attainment true nature, arising existence-attainment false thinking, immediately becoming ignorance and afflictions, arousing karma and becoming six-realm retribution. Also the Mahāprajñāpāramitā says: Though all dharmas have no existence, they are thus existent. Being thus existent yet having no existence—not knowing this matter is called ignorance. True characteristics and the ground of ignorance fundamentally have no before or after. But sentient beings, from within no-existence, arbitrarily produce conceptual discrimination, flowing long in the six [sense-objects]. Turning from delusion to obtain understanding, knowing afflictions are fundamentally nirvana—what beginning or end could there be? Hence this sutra speaks of "initial single moment consciousness branch"—because it is fundamentally consciousness-understanding nature, it differs from wood and stone.

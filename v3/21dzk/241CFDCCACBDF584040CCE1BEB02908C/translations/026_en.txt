"Ten-stage nature" refers to being in the noble seed-nature from the first stage and above.

"Great King, this sutra is named 'The Sutra of the Benevolent King Asking about Prajñāpāramitā.'" The commentary says: From "Great King" below, in the third section of answering the question, establishing the sutra's name and encouraging acceptance. The text has three parts. First, generally listing the sutra's name and encouraging people to accept and maintain it. From "There are also immeasurable" below, the second reveals the sutra's functions. From "You should" below, the third concludes by encouraging acceptance and maintenance. In the first part listing names, saying "this sutra is named 'The Benevolent King Asking about Prajñā'" - this sutra has many names. If named after the one who requests, it is called "The Sutra of the Benevolent King's Questions." Consider the others likewise.

"This sutra also has immeasurable merits, called 'Merit of Protecting the Nation,' also called 'Dharma Medicine for All Kings.' Taking and practicing it, there is nothing without great efficacy. The merit of protecting dwellings also protects all sentient beings' bodies. This prajñāpāramitā protects nations like city moats, walls, swords, spears and shields." The commentary says: The second section reveals the sutra's functions to make people joyfully maintain it. Saying "there are also immeasurable merits" generally reveals the vastness of merits. Below, separately revealing functions, there are four parts. First, protecting the nation and also the king's body. Second, clarifying protection of dwellings and also people's bodies. Third, from "precisely this" below, concluding that prajñā protects the nation. Fourth, from "like cities" below, using metaphors to reveal protection of the nation. City moats are like precepts. The city's height metaphorically represents Mahāyāna. Moats are below and outside the city and smaller, metaphorically representing Hīnayāna - all having the meaning of preventing wrong and stopping evil. Walls are like samādhi, stabilizing the body. Broad walls metaphorically represent Mahāyāna, small walls metaphorically represent Hīnayāna. Swords represent wisdom. Spears and shields are like precepts and samādhi. Consider this carefully.

"You should accept and maintain prajñāpāramitā; it is also like this." The commentary says: The third section, from "You should" below, concludes by encouraging acceptance and maintenance.

《Title: Commentary on the Benevolent King Sutra for Protecting the Nation, Volume Two》
Benevolent King Prajñāpāramitā Sutra for Protecting the Nation, Chapter Five: Protecting the Nation

The commentary says: In the six chapters of the main teaching, the previous three chapters clarified the prajñā that can be taught, explained the sutra's power and function, generated the bodhisattvas' two benefits, could protect the Buddha-fruit, and knew the quiescence of the four birth characteristics, realized the original non-duality of cause and effect, and attained transcendental benefits - this was completed previously. This present chapter clarifies the protected nation and explains worldly benefits. At the beginning of the previous Emptiness Chapter, the sixteen kings intended to ask about methods for governing nations. The Buddha first answered for the bodhisattvas, explaining the causes and conditions for protecting Buddha-fruit and protecting the practices of the ten stages. The previous three chapters explained various contemplation gates and clarified the protecting prajñā. Through this, understanding was generated; inner virtue being complete, outer transformation also manifested. The sutra's awesome power makes nations free from disasters and people and kings safely protected. Hence it is called "protection." What is protected? The title names it "nation." Nation means the sovereign's transformative domain - this is called nation. Extensively explaining this meaning, therefore establishing the name. Hence called "Protecting the Nation Chapter." Question: Why can propagating this sutra protect nations? Answer: The meanings are numerous. Now briefly clarifying three meanings by which it can protect nations. First, prajñā is the Buddha-mother, able to give birth to all Buddhas. Now propagating prajñā accords with the Buddha's mind and is protected by the Buddha's supernatural powers, able to prevent the seven disasters and make all people peaceful and happy. Second, Mahāyāna sutras are what bodhisattvas study. By lecturing this sutra, bodhisattvas from the ten directions gather like clouds in this land to hear and receive the Mahāyāna. Because bodhisattvas' supernatural powers are great, they can prevent the seven disasters from arising. Third, this Mahāyāna sutra is beloved and respected by the dharma-protecting dragons, spirits and ghosts of the ten directions.

By lecturing this sutra, dragons, spirits and ghosts all come to hear the dharma, protect the nation and can eliminate the seven disasters. Because disasters and obstacles do not arise, it can protect the nation. This chapter is divided into five sections. First, clarifying the practices for protecting the nation. From "Great King, in former days" below, the second cites the past to reveal the present, clarifying that benefits are not empty. From "Great King, sixteen great nations" below, the third encourages beings to practice. From "Now at the time of Śākyamuni" below, the fourth [describes] attained benefits. From "I now" below, the fifth conclusion.

"At that time, the Buddha told the Great King: 'You should listen well. I now correctly explain the methods for protecting nations. You should accept and maintain prajñāpāramitā.'" First clarifying the practices for protecting the nation. The commentary says: "Telling the Great King" is admonishing them to listen. "I now" promises to give the correct explanation. From "You should maintain" below encourages the king to practice. This begins to answer the question about causes and conditions for protecting nations in the previous Emptiness Chapter.

"When the nation is about to be disturbed and destroyed, burned by kalpa-fire, and bandits come to destroy the nation." The commentary says: Second, clarifying the time when protection is needed. The text saying "when the nation is about to be disturbed" clarifies that the seven disasters are about to arise, troubling the nation and afflicting the people. Therefore the ruler should cultivate virtue and ward off disasters to make all people peaceful and happy. The text saying "kalpa-fire" does not necessarily mean kalpa-fire. Speaking of bandits, there are two kinds: first, external robbers and wild beasts; second, internal afflictions created within. Since there are two kinds of bandits, protection also has two kinds: first, external - namely the hundred groups of spirits; second, internal - namely merit and wisdom. Whether internal or external, all are the spiritual powers of Buddhas and bodhisattvas.

"You should invite a hundred Buddha images, a hundred bodhisattva images, a hundred arhat images, a hundred bhikṣu assemblies, the four great assemblies, and seven assemblies to listen to this sutra together, and invite a hundred dharma teachers to lecture on prajñāpāramitā." The commentary says: Third, in clarifying the practices, it is again divided into four sections. First, from "invite a hundred Buddhas" below, listing seven kinds of merit fields and clarifying the vastness of merit fields.

○ First clarifying the seven kinds of merit fields. First, a hundred Buddhas. Second, a hundred bodhisattvas. Third, a hundred arhats. These refer to after entering nirvāṇa, so only images are invited because the seven disasters are urgent in the final age. If referring to when Buddha was in the world, the actual bodies of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and arhats would also be invited. Fourth, a hundred bhikṣu assemblies. Fifth, the four great assemblies: first bhikṣus, second bhikṣuṇīs, third upāsakas, fourth upāsikās. Sixth, the seven assemblies - beyond the previous four great assemblies, additionally including śikṣamāṇās, śrāmaṇeras, and śrāmaṇerikās to make seven. Seventh, inviting a hundred dharma teachers. Why are these seven kinds of dharma teachers all numbered as hundreds? Briefly citing round numbers to correspond with the hundred groups of spirits.

"Before a hundred lion-roar high seats, light a hundred lamps, burn a hundred mixed incenses, use a hundred kinds of colored flowers to make offerings to the Three Jewels, and use robes and various implements to make offerings to dharma teachers, as well as light meals and midday food." The commentary says: Second, in clarifying six kinds of offering implements: first, a hundred lion seats - because Buddhas and dharma teachers sit on these seats to expound the wonderful dharma, they are called lion seats. Second, lighting a hundred lamps. Third, a hundred mixed incenses. Fourth, a hundred kinds of colored flowers. Fifth, robes and various implements. Various implements include: robes, bowl, sitting mat, razor, woolen garment, water pot, knife, water strainer, bowl bag, needle case. Sixth, light meals and midday food. Using these six kinds to make offerings to the Three Jewels.
《Private note: Woolen garment refers to wool. Zhao said: weaving hemp to make socks.》

"At that time, Great King, lecture and read this sutra twice daily." The commentary says: Third, clarifying the proper manner of expounding dharma. The text saying "lecture twice daily" means morning and afternoon.

"In your nation there are a hundred groups of spirits. Each of these groups has another hundred groups. They delight in hearing this sutra. These spirits protect your nation." The commentary says: Fourth, clarifying how benevolent spirits protect the nation. The text saying "hundred

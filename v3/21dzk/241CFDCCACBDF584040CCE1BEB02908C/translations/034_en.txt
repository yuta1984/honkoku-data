Third, clarifying the four fearlessnesses; fourth, clarifying certification of fruition; fifth, the time period of advancement. First, establishing the name. The text says "Excellent Penetration Bodhisattva," which is the Hard-to-Conquer Ground. Second, explaining patience: the text says "in compliant path patience." Fifth-ground bodhisattvas cultivate the middle grade of compliant patience. Following and complying with the suchness path in contemplation is called "compliant path patience." Third, clarifying the four fearlessnesses has two parts: first general establishment, then specific explanation. The initial general establishment says "using the four fearlessnesses." From "contemplating nayuta" below specifically explains the fearlessness of all-knowledge. "Nayuta truths" means "hundred million thousand myriad truths." Inner path treatises refer to the Buddha's twelve divisions of teachings. Outer path treatises refer to the four Vedas. Medicine prescriptions refer to the sovereign-minister mutual restraint principles of materia medica. Crafts means skillfully knowing how to establish city walls, markets, etc. Incantations means skillfully understanding magical arts. "I am a person of all-knowledge" concludes the fearlessness of all-knowledge. Second, from "extinguishing the three realms" below clarifies the fearlessness of exhaustion of contaminations. The doubt and other afflictions of the three realms are: first, body-view; second, precept-grasping; third, doubt. Personal self has long been exhausted, and the two afflictions of body-view and precept-grasping are also eliminated. Now for the first time eliminating doubt. Doubt is the function of mental afflictions. Taking the three realms as foundation and emerging from the three realms, therefore called "doubt etc. of the three realms." "My characteristics are already exhausted" means there is no pride. Third, "knowing each ground has something that emerges" clarifies the fearlessness of exhausting the path of suffering. Fourth, "having something that does not emerge" clarifies the fearlessness of explaining the manifest path. Bodhisattvas separately have four fearlessness names appearing in the Great Treatise on Wisdom: first, retention through hearing; second, teaching dharma; third, answering difficulties; fourth, severing doubt. Fourth, certifying fruition says "cultivating and gathering immeasurable merits, immediately entering sakṛdāgāmin fruition." The Sanskrit original is called śakṛd-āgāmin. This is called "once-returner." Śakṛd means once,

āgāmin means coming. Severing six grades of desire-realm cultivation path. Fifth advancement saying "eight incalculable" means building upon the previous seven numbers, therefore called eight. Dhāraṇī means "total retention."

Furthermore, Constant Manifestation of Reality, dwelling in compliant patience, practices middle path contemplation, exhausting the three realms' accumulation causes, accumulation karma, and all afflictions. Therefore contemplating "neither existence nor non-existence, one characteristic without characteristics yet not two," therefore certifying anāgāmin position. Again, in nine incalculable kalpas practicing illumination of the middle path, therefore through joyful power being born in all Buddha lands. The commentary says: From Constant Manifestation below is the sixth Manifest Ground. There are six sections: first, ground name; second, dwelling in patience and cultivating contemplation; third, severing delusions; fourth, certifying fruition; fifth, advancement; sixth, concluding the middle path. First, presenting the name is Constant Manifestation of Reality. Second, dwelling in patience and cultivating contemplation says "dwelling in compliant patience practicing middle path contemplation." This clarifies sixth-ground bodhisattvas practicing no-attainment contemplation. Third, extinguishing delusions says "exhausting the three realms' accumulation causes and accumulation karma." Although karma cannot be severed, when afflictions are severed, karma's causes naturally cease. Saying "neither existence nor non-existence" is precisely the manifestation of the middle path. "One characteristic without characteristics" means: explaining one in opposition to two, explaining non-existence in opposition to existence. Therefore called "one characteristic without characteristics." When two is eliminated, one also disappears; when existence is exhausted, non-existence also ceases. This is antidotal language—do not make dharma-view interpretations. Fourth, certifying anāgāmin fruition. In the West called anāgāmin, here called "non-returner." Anā means not, gāmin means returning. Fifth, advancement time period is nine incalculable. Sixth, concluding middle path contemplation says "practicing illumination of the middle path." Through vow-power therefore able to be born in all Buddha lands.

Furthermore, Profound Penetration Bodhisattva, in ten incalculable kalpas cultivating non-arising dharma-bliss patience, extinguishing the three realms' accumulation

cause-karma-fruition, dwelling in final body, with immeasurable merit practices all accomplished, non-arising wisdom, exhaustion wisdom, and five-division dharma body all fulfilled, dwelling in equal tenth ground arhat Brahmā heaven position, constantly practicing three emptiness gate contemplation, with hundreds of thousands of myriads of samādhis complete, propagating and transforming the dharma treasury. The commentary says: From Profound Penetration below clarifies the seventh ground. The text has seven sections: first, establishing ground name; second, advancement; third, discerning patience; fourth, separating from obstacles; fifth, gathering virtue; sixth, concluding position; seventh, transformative practice within the ground. First, establishing the name saying "Profound Penetration Bodhisattva" is the Far-Going Ground. Second, advancement time saying "ten incalculable" refers to the quantity within the ground. Third, discerning patience saying "non-arising dharma-bliss"—the seventh ground attains non-arising, initially certifying dharma and according with spirit, therefore called "dharma-bliss patience." For example, just as the first ground initially attaining the ten grounds and beginning is therefore called joy. This is the lower grade contemplation of non-arising patience. Fourth, separating from obstacles saying "extinguishing three realms' accumulation cause-karma-fruition" refers to birth-and-death segments, not permanent exhaustion. Fifth, gathering virtue saying "dwelling in final body"—the exhaustion of three-realm binding karma birth-and-death segments is called "dwelling in final body." The five-division dharma body refers to uncontaminated precepts, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and liberated knowledge-vision. Sixth, concluding position saying "dwelling in tenth ground arhat Brahmā heaven position." Brahmā heaven position refers to the first dhyāna Brahmā king. Saying "tenth ground" means adding seven to the previous three worthy stages, called "tenth ground." Hundreds of thousands of myriads of samādhis refers to uncontaminated concentration. Propagating transformation means benefiting sentient beings.

Furthermore, Equal Awakening Patience, dwelling in non-arising patience, contemplates mind and mental factors as extinct, yet with signless characteristics, bodiless body, unknowing knowing, yet using mind to ride upon the directions of all directions, dwelling peacefully in the dwelling of non-dwelling, being in existence constantly cultivating emptiness, being in emptiness constantly myriad-transforming, dually illuminating all dharmas. Therefore knowing "this is appropriate, this is inappropriate, up to all-knowledge ten powers contemplation," therefore able to ascend to mahārāga position, transforming all lands and sentient beings, for a thousand incalculable kalpas practicing ten powers dharma, mind and mental factors corresponding, constantly entering seeing-Buddha samādhi. The commentary says: From Equal Awakening below clarifies the eighth ground, with five sections: first, establishing ground name; second, discerning patience; third, clarifying signless contemplation; fourth, concluding minister position; fifth, advancement time. First, establishing the name saying "Equal Awakening Patience"—namely the Immovable Ground. Second, explaining patience saying "dwelling in non-arising patience"—the middle grade. Third, clarifying contemplative understanding saying "contemplating mind and mental factors as extinct" refers to no-attainment mind. "Signless characteristics" means: without seventh ground's effortful characteristics yet having eighth ground's effortless characteristics. "Bodiless body" means: without seventh ground's effortful body yet having eighth ground's effortless dharma body. "Unknowing knowing" means: not the same as seventh ground's effortful knowing yet having eighth ground and above's effortless knowing. This clarifies that the eighth ground dually illuminates myriad objects—without wisdom yet with wisdom. "Using mind to ride upon the directions of all directions"—riding can transport and carry all beings. "Direction" means sentiments having tendencies, called direction. Therefore the Book of Changes says "directions gather by categories." Through directionless responsive transformation following beings wherever they are, therefore called "directions of all directions." Although universally transforming all directions, yet not dwelling in birth-and-death. This is uncontaminated natural letting-go. Therefore saying "dwelling peacefully in non-dwelling." "Being in existence constantly cultivating emptiness" clarifies being in existence yet not defiled by existence; existence does not obstruct emptiness; knowing existence is not existence, therefore able to have unobstructed emptiness and existence. "Emptiness constantly myriad-transforming" means: quiescent yet constantly functioning. Emptiness and existence being non-dual, therefore called "dually illuminating all dharmas." Therefore "knowing what is appropriate and inappropriate" generally concludes and clarifies the simultaneous illumination of existence and non-existence. Emptiness is called "appropriate," existence is called "inappropriate." Fourth, concluding position. Mahārāga translates as "great minister."

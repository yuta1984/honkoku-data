Three truths manifesting, great wisdom light　　Illuminating thousand billion lands, teaching all

"Dharma Manifestation" is precisely the Manifest ground. "Revelation" is precisely the person within the ground, called a great being, also named "Revelation." "Sovereign King" is precisely the appropriated result. "Without duality, without illumination" is precisely principle-emptiness. "Three truths" is precisely the third truth. "Manifesting" is precisely great wisdom manifesting. "Illuminating thousand billion lands" is precisely the transformed lands.

Flame Victory Dharma Manifestation formless samādhi　　Able to wash away the three realms' deluded mind afflictions
Empty wisdom, tranquil, without conditioned contemplation　　Again observing mind-emptiness, immeasurable rewards

These two lines conclude the above. Flame is the fourth ground, Victory is the fifth ground, Manifestation is the sixth ground. The lower three characters praise the function of the victory ground. The next sentence severs obstructions, hence saying "able to wash." Washing deluded mind afflictions. The next sentence clarifies true wisdom ceasing conditions. Since conditioned contemplation both become obscure, it says "tranquil, without conditioned contemplation." The next sentence "again observing mind-emptiness" doesn't mean not observing form—according to the majority it says "observing mind-emptiness." Immeasurable rewards means skillful means wisdom is the reward of immeasurable merit.

Far-Reaching No-arising First Dhyāna King　　　Constantly teaching sentient beings in ten million billion lands
Not yet having crossed the reward body, one birth remains　　Advancing to enter the equal contemplation dharma-stream ground
First entering no-conditions vajra forbearance　　　Never again receiving three-realm reward forms
Contemplating ultimate meaning without dual illumination　　Twenty-one births in empty tranquil practice
Three-realm love habits complying with path concentration　　Far-reaching correct being alone truly understands

From "Far-reaching" below, the fifth section has ten verses praising the above no-arising forbearance of seventh ground and above, divided into three parts. The first five lines explain the above seventh ground no-arising forbearance lower grade. The next three lines explain the above eighth ground no-arising forbearance middle grade. The next two lines explain the above ninth ground no-arising forbearance upper grade. The first five lines are divided into ten sentences. The initial "Far-reaching" means the seventh ground is called the Far-reaching Ground. "One birth remaining" means before the grounds there is fragmented birth. From the first ground above there is only transformational birth. Now saying "seventh ground one birth remains" borrows characteristics to understand meaning, hence saying "reward one-body birth remains." Another interpretation: the seventh ground is functional birth, namely transformational birth, hence saying "one birth remains." Eighth ground and above have no functional birth, only having non-functional transformational birth. Because of dual contemplation it says "equal." Because of non-functional water it says "dharma-stream." "First entering" means turning away from functional characteristics to arise, hence saying "first entering." Because ceasing characteristics is firm, it says "no-conditions vajra forbearance." Because separating from three-realm habits, it says "never receiving." Also said: not receiving future fragmented rewards, hence saying "three-realm rewards not received." From eighth ground above, further receiving second dhyāna body is transformational. Because attaining middle-way ultimate meaning, it says "no dual illumination." From first ground to seventh ground, each ground has three births, hence saying "twenty-one births." Because reaching dharma's having nothing, it says "empty tranquil practice." Three-realm love habits means three-realm ignorance habits. "Alone truly understanding" means seventh ground bodhisattvas understand functional formlessness, hence saying "alone truly understanding."

Equal Contemplation Bodhisattva Second Dhyāna King　　　Transformational birth dharma-body immeasurable light
Entering hundred eternal lands transforming all　　Completely illuminating three-time eternal kalpa events
Reflecting back on pleasure-emptiness, exhausting source　　In the third truth constantly tranquil

【Upper section of left page】
From "Equal Contemplation" below, three lines six sentences praise the above eighth ground, having six distinctions. The first sentence clarifying "Second Dhyāna King" clarifies benefiting others. Eighth ground bodhisattvas forget merit and cease characteristics, dually contemplating two truths, universally cultivating myriad practices, entering great dharma-stream water. Equally contemplating emptiness-existence, hence called "equal contemplation." The second sentence clarifies that eighth ground and above attain great dharma-body, called benefiting-others body. The third sentence clarifying "entering hundred million billion" is benefiting-others practice. The fourth sentence "completely illuminating billion kalpas" clarifies benefiting-others wisdom. The fifth sentence: eighth ground and above attain reflective wisdom—suffering and pleasure are both empty. While worldly people mostly take suffering as real and pleasure as empty, now this eighth ground bodhisattva observes real-empty equality, exhausting the inexhaustible source. Another interpretation: reflecting back on pleasure-reception's inherent suffering is called emptiness; beginningless all-suffering is called inexhaustible source. The sixth sentence: middle-way ultimate meaning truth doesn't change, hence saying "constantly tranquil."

Wisdom Light Revelation Third Dhyāna King　　　Able to manifest simultaneously in thousand eternals
Constantly abiding in unconditioned empty tranquil practice　　Ganges sand buddha treasures understood in one thought

From Wisdom Light Bodhisattva below explains the above ninth ground. "Third Dhyāna King" clarifies benefiting-others person. "Simultaneously" clarifies benefiting-others body. The third sentence praises non-functional practice. The fourth sentence praises non-functional wisdom teaching, hence saying "understood in one thought."

Consecration Bodhisattva Fourth Dhyāna King　　　Transforming multitudes of beings in billion eternal lands
First entering vajra, understanding all　　Twenty-nine births permanently already crossed
Within extinction forbearance, lower forbearance contemplation　　One turn to wondrous awakening constantly clear

【Lower section of left page】
Equal Wisdom Consecration three-grade beings　　Removing previous remaining habit ignorance conditions
Ignorance habit characteristics therefore afflictions　　Two truths principle exhausted, everything finished

From Consecration Bodhisattva below, eight lines explain the above extinction forbearance, having two sections. The first five lines explain tenth ground extinction forbearance lower grade. The latter three lines explain extinction forbearance upper grade. The previous "Consecration" is above the thirteen dharma masters—precisely the crown of all masters, hence named "Consecration." Saying "ground king" means desire realm and four dhyāna kings, also possibly five pure abode kings. This clarifies benefiting-others person. "In billion eternals" clarifies benefiting-others practice. The third sentence clarifies vajra mind—first reaching firmness, hence saying "first entering vajra, understanding all." The fourth sentence clarifying "twenty-nine births": the tenth ground should have thirty births. Why only speak of twenty-nine births? Because one birth is reserved to be completed at buddha ground. The fifth sentence saying "lower forbearance contemplation" concludes tenth ground bodhisattvas, clarifying the extent of causation. The sixth sentence "one turn wondrous awakening" clarifies the extent of attaining fruition. The seventh sentence "Equal Wisdom Consecration three-grade beings" generally concludes the previous eighth, ninth, tenth grounds. Because they equally attain pure land, it says "three-grade beings." Equal is precisely eighth ground, Wisdom is precisely ninth ground, Consecration is tenth ground. From the eighth sentence below, three sentences clarify the extent of separating from obstructions. "Removing previous remaining habit ignorance conditions" means eighth ground and above only sever ignorance form-mind and other habitual energies, hence saying "removing previous remaining habit ignorance conditions." "Ignorance habit characteristics therefore afflictions" means these are various old afflictions. Four abode grounds are guest afflictions. Subject and object both become obscure, realm and wisdom both tranquil, hence saying "principle exhausted, everything finished."

Perfect Wisdom Formless Three-Realm King　　Thirty births exhausted, equal to great awakening

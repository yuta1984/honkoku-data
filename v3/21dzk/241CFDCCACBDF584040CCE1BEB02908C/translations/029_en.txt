Chapter Six: The Flower-Scattering Chapter of the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra for Benevolent Kings Protecting the Nation

The commentary says: The six chapters of the main teaching are divided into four. The above three chapters clarify the prajñā that can protect. The second chapter on protecting the nation clarifies the protected national territory, which is already completed. Now this chapter is the third, showing the meaning of material offerings, causing people to make offerings. The sixteen nation kings heard the above explanation of prajñā and obtained many benefits. With inner joy and celebration, they scattered flowers in offering, and from this the title was established. Hence it is called the Flower-Scattering Chapter. Question: There are many types of offerings. Why scatter flowers now? Answer: Although offerings are many, they do not exceed three types: first, respectful offerings, namely incense, flowers, etc.; second, beneficial offerings, namely clothing, etc.; third, cultivating offerings, namely the six perfections, four means of attraction, etc. This chapter mainly clarifies respectful offerings and cultivating offerings. The text of this chapter has six sections: first clarifies the sixteen nation kings hearing the dharma with joy and scattering flowers in offering. From "at that time the various nation kings" below is the second, making vows. From "the Buddha told the great king" below is the third, the Tathāgata's confirmation. From "at that time the Buddha" below is the fourth, manifesting spiritual power. From "the Buddha manifested supernatural powers" below is the fifth, the assembly's benefits.

At that time, the sixteen great nation kings heard the Buddha's explanation of ten trillion verses of prajñāpāramitā and were immeasurably joyful. They immediately scattered one hundred million trillion practice-flowers in empty space, which transformed into one seat. The Buddhas of the ten directions together sat on one seat explaining prajñāpāramitā. Immeasurable great assemblies together sat on one seat, holding golden net flowers and scattering them above Śākyamuni Buddha, forming ten thousand wheel-flowers covering the great assembly above.

assemblies together sit on one seat, holding golden net flowers and scattering them above Śākyamuni. Fourth, golden net flowers transform into ten thousand wheel-flowers covering the great assembly.

Again they scattered eighty-four thousand prajñāpāramitā flowers, which in empty space transformed into white cloud platforms. In the platforms, King Bright Light Buddha together with immeasurable great assemblies explained prajñāpāramitā. The great assemblies in the platforms held fragrant roar flowers and scattered them on Śākyamuni Buddha and the various great assemblies. The commentary says: The second, flowers of above-ground practices, has three parts in the text: first clarifies scattered flowers transforming into white cloud platforms; second clarifies King Bright Light Buddha in the platform explaining prajñā; third, great assemblies in the platform holding thunder-roar flowers and scattering them on Śākyamuni and the great assembly.

Again they scattered wonderful enlightenment flowers, which in empty space transformed into diamond cities. In the cities, Lion Roar King Buddha together with Buddhas of the ten directions and great bodhisattva assemblies discussed the ultimate truth. At that time, bodhisattvas in the cities held bright light flowers and scattered them above Śākyamuni Buddha, forming one flower platform. In the platform, Buddhas of the ten directions explained the non-dual dharma. The commentary says: The third, scattering wonderful enlightenment flowers at the Buddha stage, has five parts in the text: first clarifies scattering wonderful enlightenment flowers; second, flowers in empty space transform to create diamond cities; third, Lion Roar King Buddha in the cities together with Buddhas of the ten directions and great bodhisattvas discusses the ultimate truth; fourth, at that time bodhisattvas in the cities held bright light flowers and scattered them on Śākyamuni Buddha, forming one flower platform; fifth, Buddhas of the ten directions in the platform explained the non-dual dharma.

in empty space forming purple cloud canopies covering the three thousand great thousand worlds; third, gods and humans in the canopies scattering Ganges-sand flowers. If these are considered in terms of phenomena, they are respectful offerings. If considered in terms of practice, they are precisely cultivating offerings.

At that time, after the various nation kings made flower-scattering offerings, they vowed that past Buddhas, present Buddhas, and future Buddhas would constantly explain prajñāpāramitā, and vowed that all those who accept and maintain it—monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—would obtain what they seek as they wish and constantly practice prajñāpāramitā. The commentary says: From "at that time various" below is the second major section of the chapter on making vows. The text has two parts: first, at that time the various great nations vow that Buddhas of the three times constantly explain prajñā; second, from "all those who accept and maintain" below, they vow that the four assemblies obtain what they seek as they wish and constantly practice no-attainment prajñā.

The Buddha told the great king: "So it is, so it is. As the king has said, prajñāpāramitā should be explained and should be received. This is the mother of all Buddhas, the mother of all bodhisattvas, the birthplace of spiritual powers." The commentary says: From "the Buddha told" below is the third major section of the chapter on the Tathāgata's confirmation. The text has two parts: first, confirmation and approval, hence saying "so it is, so it is"; second, from "as the king said" below, encouraging that it should be explained and should be accepted and maintained, praising prajñā as the foundation of all sages. There are three phrases: it is the mother of all Buddhas, the mother of all bodhisattvas, the mother of all spiritual powers.

At that time the Buddha manifested five inconceivable spiritual transformations for the king: one flower entering immeasurable flowers, immeasurable flowers entering one flower; one Buddha-land entering immeasurable Buddha-lands, immeasurable Buddha-lands entering one Buddha-land; immeasurable Buddha-lands entering one pore-land, one pore-land entering immeasurable pore-lands; immeasurable Mount Sumerus and immeasurable great seas entering into a mustard seed; one Buddha-body entering immeasurable sentient beings' bodies, immeasurable sentient beings' bodies entering one Buddha-body, entering six-realm bodies, entering earth-water-fire-wind bodies.

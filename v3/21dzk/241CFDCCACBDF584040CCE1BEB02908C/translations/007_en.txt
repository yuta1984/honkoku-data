若 was taught. The Light-Praising Prajñā is fully presented.

At that time, among the sixteen great kings, King Prasenajit of Śrāvatī was named Moonlight. King Prasenajit was born on the same day as the Tathāgata. Later, the Great Hero briefly was able to defeat strong enemies. His parents established the name Victory Army. The commentary states: The Buddha is like sunlight, and King Prasenajit assisting the Buddha is like moonlight. Therefore he is named Moonlight. 《Split writing: text》

Virtuous conduct of the ten grounds, six perfections, thirty-seven factors: The Treatise on Great Wisdom states: The thirty-seven factors take ten dharmas as their foundation—namely faith, precepts, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom, vigor, contemplation, elimination, joy, and equanimity. Opening six and combining four makes thirty-seven. Opening six means: faith divides into two—faith faculty and faith power; precepts divide into three—right speech, right action, right livelihood; vigor has eight—four right efforts, vigor faculty, vigor power, vigor factor of enlightenment, and right vigor; concentration has eight—four bases of psychic power, concentration faculty, concentration power, concentration factor of enlightenment, and right concentration; wisdom has eight—four foundations of mindfulness, wisdom faculty, wisdom power, investigation of dharmas factor of enlightenment, and right view. It also states: four foundations of mindfulness, four right efforts, four bases of psychic power, five faculties, five powers, seven factors of enlightenment, eight factors of the noble path.

Four indestructible confidences: Faith in Buddha, faith in Dharma, faith in Sangha, faith in precepts.

Practicing and transforming through Mahāyāna: What Moonlight propagates is the Great Vehicle.

Sequentially questioning the laypeople Jewel Canopy, Pure Dharma, Vimalakīrti and others—eight hundred people; then questioning Subhūti, Śāriputra and others—five thousand people; then questioning Maitreya, Lion's Roar and others—ten thousand people, but none could answer. The commentary states: They don't know what kind of dharma the Tathāgata wishes to teach by emitting light. It's not something lower levels can know. When the Tathāgata emerges from concentration, he will certainly explain himself. Therefore they don't answer. 《Split writing: text》

At that time, King Prasenajit used his supernatural powers to create eighty thousand kinds of music. The eighteen Brahmā heavens and six desire heavens also created eighty thousand kinds of music, their sounds shaking from the three thousand [worlds] to the buddha-lands of the ten directions numerous as Ganges sands. Those with karmic connections appeared: Below, in the sequence of sutra teaching, the sixth [section describes] how Moonlight and the various heavens make music, praise the Buddha, summon assemblies from the ten directions to come and hear the sutra. Within this are three sections: first King Prasenajit, next the heavens, then bodhisattvas coming from other directions. The textual structure is clear.

From those other buddha-lands: from the south, Bodhisattva Dharma Lance with five hundred million great assemblies came to enter this great gathering; from the east, Bodhisattva Jewel Pillar with nine hundred million great assemblies came to enter this great gathering; from the north, Bodhisattva Space Nature with one hundred thousand million great assemblies came to enter this great gathering; from the west, Bodhisattva Good Dwelling with assemblies numerous as ten Ganges sands came to enter this great gathering. The six directions were likewise, making music similarly, and together creating immeasurable music to awaken the Tathāgata. The Buddha immediately knew the time, obtained [knowledge of] sentient beings' faculties, arose from concentration, and sat properly on the lotus lion throne like a vajra mountain king. The lion throne represents the Tathāgata as lion king among humans. Consider this: vajra means unmoving and unchanging.

The great assembly rejoiced, each manifesting immeasurable supernatural powers, dwelling on earth and in space.

Humane King Sūtra for Protecting the Nation, Prajñāpāramitā, Chapter Two: Contemplating Emptiness

【Upper section of left page】
The above is the introductory section; below is the main doctrine. Though there are six meanings in the main doctrine, they are summarized as four: First, the first three chapters clarify the prajñā that can protect, also called inner protection. Second, the single chapter on protecting the nation clarifies what is protected—protecting the nation—also called outer protection. Third, the single chapter on scattering flowers demonstrates material offerings to encourage human offerings. Fourth, the single chapter on upholding clarifies the virtuous conduct and characteristics of those who propagate the sutra. The chapter on contemplating emptiness clarifies protecting results; the chapter on teaching and transforming clarifies protecting the causes of the ten grounds, teaching beings to initiate practice. The chapter on two truths discusses and analyzes the non-duality of two truths. Within results there is not an absence of causes; within causes there is not an absence of results. Consider this from one perspective. Contemplating emptiness: The commentary states: What is called contemplating emptiness is when buddhas and bodhisattvas use markless wonderful wisdom to illuminate markless wonderful realms. Inner and outer are both obscured, conditions and contemplation are both quiescent—therefore it's called contemplating emptiness. Hence the text below states that seeing realms and seeing wisdom are not noble vision. Contemplation is correct contemplation without attainment; emptiness is the true characteristics of all dharmas, different names for dharma-nature and original limit. It's not the emptiness seen by the two vehicles. 《Split writing: text》 This chapter has three sections: first, clarifying the announcement to the Great Vehicle; second, from "at that time the great king" below, three questions and answers where Moonlight consults and requests clarification of the meaning of protecting results; third, from "when the Buddha taught the dharma" below, clarifying the benefits gained by the assembly. In the first announcement there are four statements: first, knowing the intentions of the sixteen kings; second, from "I now" below, permitting the teaching; third, from "listen carefully" below, commanding listening; fourth, from "at that time King Prasenajit" below, scattering flowers in offering.

At that time the Buddha told the great assembly: "Knowing the intentions of the sixteen great kings who wish to ask about the causes and conditions for protecting the nation..." The commentary states: Pure and peaceful territory with all people happy and secure—this is the fundamental intention of rulers. 《Split writing: text》

"I will now first teach the bodhisattvas the causes and conditions for protecting buddha-results and protecting the practices of the ten grounds. Listen carefully,

listen carefully 《Split writing: hearing wisdom》 and well contemplate this 《Split writing: contemplating wisdom》, practice according to the dharma." 《Split writing: practicing wisdom》 The commentary states: If one wishes to guard inner and outer [realms], first establish inner practice. When inner practice is accomplished, outer protection becomes complete. Therefore inner protection is clarified first. 《Split writing: text》 At that time 《Split writing: [margin] scattering flowers in offering》 King Prasenajit said "Excellent! For this great matter and its causes" and immediately scattered one hundred billion varieties of colored flowers, which transformed into one hundred billion jeweled canopies covering all the great assemblies. The commentary states: Transforming into jeweled canopies represents that though practicing causes in the Buddha-field may be small, the resulting fruits are great—like small flowers becoming jeweled canopies. Covering all the great assemblies represents universal compassionate protection. 《Split writing: text》

At that time the great king again arose, made obeisance, and addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, how do all bodhisattvas protect buddha-results? How do they protect the causes and conditions of ten-ground practices?" Moonlight consults and questions about the meaning of protecting results. Within this are three questions and answers: The first question and answer clarifies that the two emptinesses of persons and dharmas are originally quiescent and non-dual with buddha-results. The second asks: if sentient beings are unobtainable, how can they be transformed? The answer: even causes and conditions are quiescent, how much more so sentient beings. The third asks: if wisdom is also empty—if wisdom exists, illuminating function can be distinguished, but if wisdom is already empty and quiescent, how can illumination be distinguished? The answer: dharmas are still ceremonially empty, how much more so wisdom. In the first question, first Moonlight questions, then from "all bodhisattvas" below presents the matter requested.

The Buddha said: "Bodhisattvas transform the four births..." Below is the Buddha's words. The commentary states: If one knows that the four births and Buddha are one without two, this is protecting buddha-results. 《Split writing: text》 The four births are womb-birth, egg-birth, moisture-birth, and transformation-birth. Consider this.

Not contemplating form as suchness: The commentary states: The Tripiṭaka master says: If one eliminates form and returns to suchness, one should say "contemplate form as suchness." But the text says "not contemplating form as suchness"—if one eliminates form while preserving suchness, the contemplating mind is not yet pure. Now the perfect [teaching]...

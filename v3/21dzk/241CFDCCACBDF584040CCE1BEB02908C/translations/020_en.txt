Regarding innate good and innate evil, the commentary says: The text's "innate good, innate evil" means that when one conditions on a good realm of objects, good consciousness arises. This good consciousness is born from the intrinsic true-reality good correct cause. Further, when conditioning on good matters and giving rise to this consciousness, it is born from the intrinsic true-reality good correct cause, and when conditioning on good matters and giving rise to this consciousness, it is good. If one conditions on evil realms of objects and gives rise to evil consciousness, this evil consciousness is born from the cause of ignorance-perfuming birth. Further, when conditioning on evil matters and giving rise to this consciousness, it is called evil.

Regarding "evil becomes the root of immeasurable evil consciousness, good becomes the root of immeasurable good consciousness," the commentary says: That evil becomes the root of immeasurable evil consciousness and good becomes the root of immeasurable good consciousness means that through the perfuming power of this initial single moment of good and evil consciousness, each produces immeasurable good and evil habitual fruits.

Regarding "from the initial single moment to the vajra final moment, immeasurable ineffable consciousness arises within," the commentary says: "From initial single moment to vajra final moment, giving rise to ineffable consciousness within"—this meaning is within birth-and-death, clarifying the cause of becoming sentient beings.

Regarding "accomplishing sentient beings' form and mind," the commentary says: Accomplishing sentient beings' form and mind explains the fruit.

Regarding "this is the root of sentient beings," the commentary says: The text's "root of sentient beings" concludes that initial single moment consciousness is the foundation of becoming sentient beings. Another interpretation: "initial single moment" clarifies the beginning of continuity—this takes beginninglessness as the beginning. "Vajra final moment" means: for Hinayana, the end of segmented [existence]; for Mahayana, the end of transformational [existence].

Regarding "form is called form-covering, mind is called consciousness-covering, perception-covering, sensation-covering, formation-covering," the commentary says: From "form called form-covering" below, the second briefly presents the names of the five aggregates. From "covering means" below, the third explains names with extensive interpretation.

Regarding "covering means using concealment-obscuration, body is called accumulation," the commentary says: Covering means concealment-obscuration. Since the conventional body is constituted by the five aggregates, it is called accumulation.

Regarding "Great King, this single form-dharma produces immeasurable forms. What the eye obtains is form, what the ear obtains is sound, what the nose obtains is fragrance, what the tongue obtains is taste, what the body obtains is contact, firmness-maintaining is called earth, water is called moistening, fire is called heat, lightness-heaviness is called wind, where the five consciousnesses arise is called faculty," the commentary says: That this single form-dharma produces immeasurable forms means, according to the Satyasiddhi, fourteen types of form constitute the form-aggregate. Aggregates cover sentient beings so they cannot escape from birth-and-death. First clarifying the five sense-object forms, then clarifying the four great-element forms, then clarifying the five sense-faculty forms—the textual meaning is quite evident.

Regarding "thus one form, one mind has inconceivable form and mind," the commentary says: From "thus one form" below is the general conclusion. Form and mind have inconceivable form and mind.

Regarding "Great King, ordinary beings' six consciousnesses are coarse, therefore they obtain conventional blue, yellow, square, round, etc.—immeasurable conventional form-dharmas. Sages' six consciousnesses are pure, therefore they obtain real dharma-forms—food, taste, contact, all real form-dharmas," the commentary says: From "Great King, ordinary beings' six consciousnesses" below, the fourth distinguishes the coarse-subtle discrimination of ordinary and sage forms. Ordinary beings' six consciousnesses take dharmas in general characteristics, hence it says they obtain conventional blue and yellow above. Sages discriminate the four subtle [atoms] etc., hence it says they obtain the real. Also: sages condition on the dharma-realm and through the six consciousnesses obtain true-reality dharmas.

Regarding "sentient beings is a name of conventional truth. Whether existent or non-existent, merely producing sentient beings' recollection is called conventional truth. Conventional truth is conventionally deceptive and illusory, hence up to the six paths of illusion—sentient beings see illusion, illusion sees illusion," the commentary says: From "sentient beings is a name of conventional truth" below, the fifth clarifies that sentient beings and all dharmas belong to conventional truth. There are also three parts. First, generally indicating that everything belongs to conventional truth. Second, from "continuity-conventional" below, clarifying that the three conventionals belong to conventional truth. Third, from "Great King" below, clarifying that all buddhas and worthy sages, responding to conditions, know all is illusory existence and conclude belonging to conventional truth. Second, from "before buddhas' appearance in the world" below, clarifies establishing causal-conditional names. Within this are two parts. First, clarifying that regardless of sentient beings' existence or non-existence, all are like illusion—called "causeless." Because of conventional deception and illusion there is existence; up to the six paths are also like illusion—called "fruitless." Because sentient beings' false conceptual thinking is constituted by conventional deception, there are the names of human-heaven six paths. If one penetrates that this falsity fundamentally does not exist, hence saying "illusion sees illusion."

Regarding "Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras, divine self, etc.—form and mind are called illusory truth," the commentary says: Second, from "Brahmins" below, clarifying that noble and base are all like illusion, entirely entering conventional truth. Another interpretation: previously clarifying ordinary beings taking conventional names as real; next, from "illusion is illusion" below, clarifying sages knowing conventional names are empty. This text should say "illusionist sees illusion," yet saying "sentient beings" means these are buddha-sentient-beings.

Regarding "illusory truth-dharmas—before buddhas' appearance in the world there are no names, no meaning-names, illusory dharmas and illusions have no names, no substantial characteristics, no names of the three realms, no names of good-evil karmic retribution and six paths. Great King, therefore buddhas appear in the world for sentient beings' sake, hence explaining and creating the names of three realms and six paths. This is called immea-

surable names, like empty dharmas, four great-element dharmas, mind-dharmas, form-dharmas," the commentary says: In the second "establishing causal-conditional names" there are two parts. First, clarifying that without buddhas' appearance in the world there are no causal-conditional names. Second, from "Great King" below, clarifying that buddhas appear in the world and for sentient beings establish all world-realm six-path immeasurable various form-mind etc. names.

Regarding "continuity-conventional dharmas are neither one nor different—one also does not continue, different also does not continue. Because neither one nor different, they are called continuity-truth. Interdependence-conventional dharmas—everything is called interdependence, also called indefinite interdependence, like the five forms etc.—dharmas of existence-nonexistence, everything etc. All dharmas are all causally-constituted conventionals, constituting sentient beings. Simultaneous cause-effect, sequential cause-effect, three-times good-evil—all illusions are illusory-truth sentient beings," the commentary says: The second clarifies that the three conventionals belong to conventional truth. First, continuity-conventional differs from Satyasiddhi masters. If seeing all dharmas as one is the eternalist view. If seeing all dharmas as moment-to-moment different is the nihilistic view. Departing from these two views, knowing that prior dharmas produce subsequent retribution-dharmas, dharmas arising in sequence—this clarifies the meaning of causal-conditional continuity. Hence the text says "one also does not continue, different also does not continue." Because it cuts off before and after, hence non-continuous. Interdependence has two types, also called particular-dependence, also called universal-dependence. Like long-short, old-young, good-bad are called particular-dependence. Like long depending on not-long—all myriad things are all indefinite. Beyond not-long, randomly obtaining one thing, hence called indefinite, also called universal-dependence. Causally-constituted conventional is precisely cause-constituted conventional. Four atoms constitute the four great elements and constitute the five faculties. Faculties constitute sentient beings, hence causally-constituted. The text's "five forms" means calling the five faculties "five forms," also calling blue, yellow, red, white, black forms "five forms." The text's "simultaneous cause-effect" means present five effects and three causes are called

From "sentient beings" below, [the text] raises emptiness to provide explanatory support. Fourth concludes "attaining no-mind." The three forbearances are the three forbearances within subduing forbearance: first faith, second stopping, third firm forbearance. "Making upper-middle-lower of each ground into thirty forbearances" has two explanatory meanings. First, regarding the ten grounds, each having upper-middle-lower makes thirty forbearances. Second, regarding within subduing forbearance, habit-seed is called lower, nature-seed is called middle, path-seed is called upper. Since each of the three positions has a thousand, they form thirty forbearances. The former explanation is correct. "All practice treasury" is called "fruition treasury," distinguishing buddha-ground merit. Accumulation is called treasury—this is precisely buddha perfect-awakening forbearance. Combined with the previous thirteen makes fourteen prajñā. Both cause and effect realizing no-attainment is called "inconceivable."

Why? All buddhas arise in this, perish in this, transform in this, yet having no arising, no perishing, no transformation, no self, no other, ultimately no duality, not non-transformation, neither with characteristics nor without characteristics, no coming, no going, like empty space.

From "Why?" below, the second extensively explains the merit of fourteen forbearances. The text has two parts. First regarding manifestation of function. Next regarding awakening-entry. Saying "all buddhas arise in this" means depending on forbearance to manifest transformation-bodies becoming buddhas is called arising. "Perish in this" means extinguishing delusions and hiding transformations is called perishing. "Transform in this" means depending on forbearance to transform sentient beings. Next regarding awakening-entry: no-arising, no-perishing, no-transformation—previously, for the sake of conditions, manifesting function explained matters of arising-perishing-transformation. If one knows arising and so forth are precisely no-arising-perishing, no words are needed. Fearing that sentient beings might become attached to characteristics according to their capacity, [the text] returns to point to the previously explained "arising" and calls it "no-arising." No-transformation and so forth are similar. No-self, no-other means one's own mind not arising is called "no-self"; not seeing objective realms is called "no-other." Also saying: not seeing self is called extinguishing ego; not seeing other is called extinguishing ego-possessions. Ultimate no-duality

【Lower section of right page】
means because both realm and wisdom are tranquil, it's called "ultimate no-duality." Neither transformation nor non-transformation means dwelling in no-attainment correct contemplation in mind, sometimes explaining transformation as non-transformation, sometimes explaining transformation as non-transformation, sometimes explaining non-transformation as transformation. Hence saying "neither transformation nor non-transformation." Neither without characteristics means fearing that sentient beings hearing words about awakening-entry might think wisdom has nothing, hence saying "not without characteristics." No coming, no going means coming has nowhere to come from, going has nowhere to go to, and so forth up to no dependence, no attainment. Hence saying "like empty space."

All sentient beings have no arising-perishing, no bondage-liberation, are neither cause nor effect, yet not non-cause-effect. Afflictions, ego-person-knowledge-views-experiencer-ego-possessions—all suffering-experiencing-formations are empty. All dharmas gathering are illusory transformation. The five aggregates have no combination, no scattering; dharmas are the same as dharma-nature, tranquilly empty. Dharma-realm-boundaries are empty, empty-formless, non-changing, non-inverted, non-compliant. Illusory transformation has no Three Jewels, no sages, no six paths, like empty space. Prajñā has no knowledge, no seeing, does not practice, does not condition, does not cause, does not receive, does not attain any illuminating characteristics. Path-practice characteristics—these path-practice characteristics are like empty space. Dharma-characteristics being thus, how could there be mind-attainment or no-mind-attainment?

From "all sentient beings" below, the third raises emptiness for explanatory support, having five sections. First clarifying sentient being emptiness. From "all suffering experiencing" below, second clarifying dharma emptiness. From "dharma-realm" below, third clarifying realm emptiness. From "no Three Jewels" below, fourth clarifying ordinary-sage emptiness. From "prajñā no-like" below, fifth clarifying knowledge emptiness. First clarifying being emptiness. The text says "sentient beings no-perishing." Sentient beings fundamentally have no attainment, separated from suffering hence saying "no-arising no-perishing." Separated from accumulation hence no-bondage no-liberation. Having no accumulation hence not cause. Having no suffering hence not effect. Through causes and conditions following conventional [truth], not non-cause-effect. Though sentient beings borrow names, they are not without causes for buddha-birth, not without fruits of nirvana.

【Upper section of left page】
Sentient beings' birth-death is called "afflictions." Birth within the five aggregates is called ego. Provisional-name practitioners are called person. Mental consciousness is called "knower." Eye-consciousness becomes "seer." Life-root not ceasing is called "liver."

Second clarifying dharma emptiness. The text "all suffering experiencing formations are empty" means contemplating that all sufferings within the five aggregates are empty. Five aggregates harmonizing is called "dharma gathering." Having no reality is called "illusory transformation." Because the five aggregates are fundamentally pure, it says "no combining-scattering." Because understanding the five aggregates are precisely thusness, it says "dharmas are the same as dharma-nature, tranquilly empty."

Third clarifying realm emptiness. The text saying "dharma-realm-boundaries empty" means since the contemplating mind is already pure, the contemplated realm is also empty. Hence saying "realm-boundaries empty." In the true-characteristic gate there are no characteristics, being non-characteristic hence saying "empty formless." Characteristics cannot move hence saying "non-changing." Separated from delusion hence called "non-inverted." Separated from understanding hence called "non-compliant." Knowing dharmas are empty hence called "illusory transformation."

Fourth clarifying ordinary-sage emptiness. No Three Jewels, no sages is called "sage emptiness." No six paths is called "ordinary emptiness."

Fifth clarifying wisdom emptiness. The text says "prajñā no-knowledge." Prajñā is called wisdom. Now saying "no-knowledge" means severing wisdom-characteristics hence saying "no-wisdom." All phrases are similar. No-knowledge no-seeing means forgetting seeing-knowing. Both conditioning and contemplation being tranquil hence saying "not practicing, not conditioning." Not receiving prajñā's name hence saying "not causing, not receiving." Internally realizing thusness hence saying "not attaining all illuminating characteristics." Dharmas having no existence hence saying "these path-practice characteristics are like empty space." Also saying because of no-discrimination, [they are] the same as empty space.

Fourth concluding "dharma-characteristics being thus"—all being empty, how could there be mind-attainment or no-mind-attainment? Also saying: because separated from existence-characteristics, one cannot have mind-attainment; because separated from non-existence-characteristics, one cannot have no-mind-attainment.

Therefore prajñā merit cannot be practiced within sentient beings yet practices, cannot be practiced within five-aggregate dharmas yet practices, cannot be practiced within realms yet practices, cannot be practiced within understanding yet practices. Hence prajñā is inconceivable. Yet all buddhas and bodhisattvas practicing within it are also inconceivable. All tathagatas transforming within illusory transformation no-dwelling dharmas are also inconceivable.

From "therefore prajñā" below, major section four clarifies prajñā forgetting words and separating from attachment. Regarding four sentences: First clarifying though one cannot attain practicing within sentient beings, yet one practices—because being-emptiness has no existence. Second, though one cannot attain practicing within five aggregates, yet one practices—because being-dharmas have no existence. Third, though one cannot attain practicing within realms, yet one practices—because realm-emptiness has no existence. Fourth, though one cannot attain practicing within understanding, yet one practices—because knowledge-emptiness has no existence.

In the second praising the explanation there are three parts. First, "therefore prajñā inconceivable" praises the fourteen prajñās. Second, producing the three-time buddhas inconceivable. Third, knowing conventional [truth] is empty-illusory yet being able to transform and benefit.

Good sons, regarding this all-merit treasury, even if immeasurable Ganges-sand thirteenth-stage consecration enlightened beings explained this merit, among hundred-thousand-billion parts, what the king explained is like one drop in the ocean. I now briefly述 partial-meaning merit, greatly benefiting all sentient beings, also being praised by past-future-present immeasurable tathagatas, with three-worthies ten-sages praising immeasurably. This is Moon Light King's partial-meaning merit.

means because both realm and wisdom are tranquil, it's called "ultimate no-duality." Neither transformation nor non-transformation means dwelling in no-attainment correct contemplation in mind, sometimes explaining transformation as non-transformation, sometimes explaining transformation as non-transformation, sometimes explaining non-transformation as transformation. Hence saying "neither transformation nor non-transformation." Neither without characteristics means fearing that sentient beings hearing words about awakening-entry might think wisdom has nothing, hence saying "not without characteristics." No coming, no going means coming has nowhere to come from, going has nowhere to go to, and so forth up to no dependence, no attainment. Hence saying "like empty space."

All sentient beings have no arising-perishing, no bondage-liberation, are neither cause nor effect, yet not non-cause-effect. Afflictions, ego-person-knowledge-views-experiencer-ego-possessions—all suffering-experiencing-formations are empty. All dharmas gathering are illusory transformation. The five aggregates have no combination, no scattering; dharmas are the same as dharma-nature, tranquilly empty. Dharma-realm-boundaries are empty, empty-formless, non-changing, non-inverted, non-compliant. Illusory transformation has no Three Jewels, no sages, no six paths, like empty space. Prajñā has no knowledge, no seeing, does not practice, does not condition, does not cause, does not receive, does not attain any illuminating characteristics. Path-practice characteristics—these path-practice characteristics are like empty space. Dharma-characteristics being thus, how could there be mind-attainment or no-mind-attainment?

From "all sentient beings" below, the third raises emptiness for explanatory support, having five sections. First clarifying sentient being emptiness. From "all suffering experiencing" below, second clarifying dharma emptiness. From "dharma-realm" below, third clarifying realm emptiness. From "no Three Jewels" below, fourth clarifying ordinary-sage emptiness. From "prajñā no-like" below, fifth clarifying knowledge emptiness. First clarifying being emptiness. The text says "sentient beings no-perishing." Sentient beings fundamentally have no attainment, separated from suffering hence saying "no-arising no-perishing." Separated from accumulation hence no-bondage no-liberation. Having no accumulation hence not cause. Having no suffering hence not effect.

Sentient beings' birth-death is called "afflictions." Birth within the five aggregates is called ego. Provisional-name practitioners are called person. Mental consciousness is called "knower." Eye-consciousness becomes "seer." Life-root not ceasing is called "liver."

Second clarifying dharma emptiness. The text "all suffering experiencing formations are empty" means contemplating that all sufferings within the five aggregates are empty. Five aggregates harmonizing is called "dharma gathering." Having no reality is called "illusory transformation." Because the five aggregates are fundamentally pure, it says "no combining-scattering." Because understanding the five aggregates are precisely thusness, it says "dharmas are the same as dharma-nature, tranquilly empty."

Third clarifying realm emptiness. The text saying "dharma-realm-boundaries empty" means since the contemplating mind is already pure, the contemplated realm is also empty. Hence saying "realm-boundaries empty." In the true-characteristic gate there are no characteristics, being non-characteristic hence saying "empty formless." Characteristics cannot move hence saying "non-changing." Separated from delusion hence called "non-inverted." Separated from understanding hence called "non-compliant." Knowing dharmas are empty hence called "illusory transformation."

Fourth clarifying ordinary-sage emptiness. No Three Jewels, no sages is called "sage emptiness." No six paths is called "ordinary emptiness."

Fifth clarifying wisdom emptiness. The text says "prajñā no-knowledge." Prajñā is called wisdom. Now saying "no-knowledge" means severing wisdom-characteristics hence saying "no-wisdom." All phrases are similar. No-knowledge no-seeing means forgetting seeing-knowing. Both conditioning and contemplation being tranquil hence saying "not practicing, not conditioning." Not receiving prajñā's name hence saying "not causing, not receiving." Internally realizing thusness hence saying "not attaining all illuminating characteristics." Dharmas having no existence hence saying "these path-practice characteristics are like empty space." Also saying because of no-discrimination, [they are] the same as empty space.

Fourth concluding "dharma-characteristics being thus"—all being empty, how could there be mind-attainment or no-mind-attainment? Also saying: because separated from existence-characteristics, one cannot have mind-attainment; because separated from non-existence-characteristics, one cannot have no-mind-attainment.

Therefore prajñā merit cannot be practiced within sentient beings yet practices, cannot be practiced within five-aggregate dharmas yet practices, cannot be practiced within realms yet practices, cannot be practiced within understanding yet practices. Hence prajñā is inconceivable. Yet all buddhas and bodhisattvas practicing within it are also inconceivable. All tathagatas transforming within illusory transformation no-dwelling dharmas are also inconceivable.

From "therefore prajñā" below, major section four clarifies prajñā forgetting words and separating from attachment. Regarding four sentences: First clarifying though one cannot attain practicing within sentient beings, yet one practices—because being-emptiness has no existence. Second, though one cannot attain practicing within five aggregates, yet one practices—because being-dharmas have no existence. Third, though one cannot attain practicing within realms, yet one practices—because realm-emptiness has no existence. Fourth, though one cannot attain practicing within understanding, yet one practices—because knowledge-emptiness has no existence.

In the second praising the explanation there are three parts. First, "therefore prajñā inconceivable" praises the fourteen prajñās. Second, producing the three-time buddhas inconceivable. Third, knowing conventional [truth] is empty-illusory yet being able to transform and benefit.

Good sons, regarding this all-merit treasury, even if immeasurable Ganges-sand thirteenth-stage consecration enlightened beings explained this merit, among hundred-thousand-billion parts, what the king explained is like one drop in the ocean.

In the retribution results, manifesting hundreds of thousands of billions of nayuta bodies to transform sentient beings. The eighth ground manifests bodies like dust particles of a million three-thousand great thousand worlds. The ninth ground, in ten asaṃkhyeya《split writing: [note] 儀｜probably 祇》, manifests bodies numbering like dust particles of hundreds of thousands of buddha-lands. According to this sutra text, the seventh ground becomes first dhyāna king, the eighth ground becomes second dhyāna king, the ninth ground becomes third dhyāna king. Know this by following the above.

Next, regarding extinction-tranquility forbearance, buddhas and bodhisattvas use this forbearance together—Below clarifying extinction-tranquility forbearance. Within this are five aspects. First clarifying the boundaries of stages and grounds. Second, from "entering vajra samādhi" below, clarifying differences in practice. Third, from "jointly contemplating" below, clarifying cause and result. Fourth, from "exhausting characteristics and signlessness" below, clarifying how result differs from cause. Fifth, from "good son" below, praising the excellence of the result. Tranquility means concentration, extinction means wisdom. Tranquil yet constantly illuminating, illuminating yet constantly tranquil. Hence called extinction-tranquility forbearance. Buddha refers to the path of liberation, bodhisattva refers to tenth-ground unobstructed path bodhisattvas. The previous four forbearances sever birth-and-death but not completely, not obtaining the name of extinction-tranquility. The unobstructed path, encompassed by the causal stage, is called lower forbearance. The liberation path, encompassed by the resultant stage, is called upper forbearance《split writing: etc.》

Entering vajra samādhi—practice within lower forbearance is called bodhisattva, practice within upper forbearance is called sarvajña. This concentration is firm and never retreating, hence called vajra samādhi. Sarvajña means all-knowing wisdom.

Jointly contemplating the ultimate truth—Observing the real truth together with buddhas is called joint contemplation.

Severing the habitual ignorance of mind in the three realms—According to the Ground Treatise, severing subtle wisdom-obstructions, hence called habitual ignorance of mind.《split writing: transformational｜subtle suffering》

Exhausting characteristics becomes vajra, exhausting characteristics and signlessness becomes sarvajña, transcending beyond conventional truth and ultimate truth becomes eleventh-ground sarvajña awakening—neither existing nor non-existing, limpidly pure, permanently abiding, unchanging, identical with the true limit. First, exhausting characteristics means ultimately destroying birth-and-death cause and result, called exhaustion. Exhausting characteristics and signlessness means not merely exhausting characteristics but exhausting signlessness. Sarvajña awakening means all-knowing wisdom. Think according to the text.

Equal to dharma-nature, with unconditioned great compassion teaching and transforming all sentient beings—This clarifies other-enjoyment body characteristics.

Riding the sarvajña vehicle, coming to transform the three realms. Good son, all sentient beings' afflictions do not leave the three-realm treasury—Riding the sarvajña vehicle, etc., clarifies transformation body characteristics. Good son, etc., is the fifth praising excellence of virtue. The text has six parts. First clarifying the transformed three realms. Second, from "buddhas" below, clarifying the capable-transforming response bodies. Third, from "outside the three realms" below, clarifying how the three realms encompass beings. Fourth, from "I say" below, clarifying refuting heterodoxy and revealing orthodoxy. Fifth, from "great king" below, praising how result differs from cause. Sixth, from "fundamental activity" below, raising cause to reveal result.《split writing: this is the truth of accumulation》

All sentient beings' resultant twenty-two faculties do not leave the three realms—This clarifies the truth of suffering. The twenty-two faculties are: the six faculties of eyes, etc.; the five of suffering, pleasure, worry, joy, equanimity, totaling eleven; the three of male, female, life, making fourteen; the five of faith, vigor, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom, making nineteen; the three outflow-free faculties totaling twenty-two. The three outflow-free faculties are: unknown faculty, already-known faculty, complete-knowledge faculty. Unknown faculty is the path of seeing. Already-known faculty extends from the path of cultivation to the stage approaching arhat. Complete-knowledge faculty is arhat fruition. Twenty-one faculties do not leave the fragmentary three realms. Complete-knowledge faculty is the no-more-learning result, not within the realms—consider this.

Buddhas' response and transformation dharma-bodies also do not leave the three realms—Speaking of the transformed sentient beings, raising the reality. The three realms are originally pure. What leaving or not leaving is there?

Outside the three realms there are no separate sentient beings—what would buddhas transform?—Outside the two kinds of three realms of fragmentary and transformational [existence], there is no further birth-and-death to transform.《split writing: etc.》

Therefore I say that claiming there is a separate sentient beings' realm-treasury outside the three realms is what the heterodox Great Existence Sutra explains, not what the seven buddhas taught—Correctly refuting heterodoxy and revealing orthodoxy. The text is clear.

Great king, I constantly tell all sentient beings: those who sever and exhaust the afflictions and karmic results of the three realms are called buddhas; self-nature purity is called awakening to sarvajña nature—This clarifies the virtue of severance. Severing and exhausting both kinds, fragmentary and transformational, with self-nature purity.

This is sentient beings' fundamental activity, this is what all buddhas and bodhisattvas originally cultivated—complete fulfillment of fourteen forbearances within the five forbearances. Among the fourteen forbearances, bodhisattvas cultivate thirteen forbearances, hence called causal practice.

Addressing the Buddha: How do bodhisattvas use fundamental activity purity to transform sentient beings?—Clarifying other-benefit characteristics. This is a question. Because bodhisattvas, with compassion and wisdom, remain undefiled in both places of birth-and-death and nirvana, it is called fundamental activity purity.

The Buddha said: From the first ground to the final ground, one's own practice-place and buddha practice-place, because of all-knowing vision—Below is the answer. This is the brief answer. From "if bodhisattvas" below is the extensive answer. First ground means initial ground. Final ground means buddha fruition. One's own practice-place means causal grounds. Buddha practice-place is as in the text. Unconditioned illumination, cause and

result both mysteriously unite. Hence called all-knowing vision.《split writing: text》

Fundamental activity means: if bodhisattvas dwell among a hundred buddha-lands, become four heavenly kings of Jambudvīpa, cultivate a hundred dharma-gates, with two-truths equanimous mind transform all sentient beings—Below is the extensive answer. Within this are distinctions of ten grounds. The first ground text has five parts. First, "dwelling among a hundred buddhas" etc. clarifies transformed buddha-lands. Second, from "becoming Jambudvīpa" below clarifies gathering and transformation. A hundred dharma-gates clarifies comprehended dharma-gates. Two truths clarifies self-practice realizing principle. Transforming sentient beings clarifies other-benefit《split writing: [note] below 他 in treasury｜commentary has character 行》characteristics. From second ground to tenth ground can be known by example. Becoming Jambudvīpa, etc. means becoming the four kinds of wheel-turning kings and four heavenly kings among humans. According to the Ground Sutra, first ground is iron wheel king. The Necklace Sutra says: In cultivating ten faiths there are one kalpa, two kalpas, three kalpas. The good of ten dwellings has three grades. Superior grade is iron wheel king, middle grade is scattered-grain king, inferior grade is human realm king. Ten dwellings: copper wheel king. Ten practices: silver wheel king. Ten dedications: gold wheel king. First ground and above: lapis lazuli jewel necklaces. First ground: hundred-jewel necklaces, seven-jewel wheel marks. Four heavenly kings have ten thousand sons as retinue. But think of differences from this sutra. Cultivating a hundred dharma-gates means understanding a hundred dharma-gates in one thought. Two truths means true and conventional being signless, hence called equal.《split writing: etc.》

If bodhisattvas dwell among a thousand buddha-lands, become Trāyastriṃśa heaven kings, cultivate a thousand dharma-gates, with ten wholesome paths《split writing: [margin]｜this》 《split writing: clarifying second ground bodhisattvas｜the four sentences within follow above》 transform all sentient beings. If bodhisattvas dwell among one hundred thousand buddha-lands, become Yāma heaven kings, cultivate one hundred thousand dharma-gates, with four dhyāna concentrations transform all sentient beings—This clarifies third ground bodhisattvas. Four-sentence differentiation same as above.

If bodhisattvas dwell among one hundred billion buddha-lands, become Tuṣita heaven kings, cultivate one hundred billion dharma-gates, practicing the path...

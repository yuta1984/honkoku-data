Bodies are also inconceivable, worlds are also inconceivable. The commentary says: From "At that time the Buddha for the king" below is the fourth spiritual power in the chapter. Manifesting five inconceivables forms five categories. First is the inconceivable transformation of flowers. One flower entering immeasurable means the few can enter the many. Immeasurable entering one means the many can enter the few. Therefore all are inconceivable spiritual powers. Second, Buddha-lands are inconceivable. Immeasurable Buddha-lands entering one Buddha-land means being able to transform many lands to enter one land. Third, pores are inconceivable because the few can contain the many. Fourth, Mount Sumeru is greatly inconceivable because the many can enter a mustard seed. Fifth, sentient beings are inconceivable because immeasurable sentient beings enter one Buddha-body. Calling the five types of spiritual powers "inconceivable" is another name for correct contemplation of no-attainment.

When the Buddha manifested supernatural powers, gods and humans of the ten directions attained the Buddha-flower samādhi, ten Ganges-sand bodhisattvas manifested bodies and became Buddhas, three Ganges-sand spirit kings of the eight divisions achieved the bodhisattva path, and ten thousand women in their present bodies attained spiritual power samādhi. Good sons, this prajñāpāramitā has benefits in the three times: it was already explained in the past, is now being explained in the present, and will be explained in the future. Listen carefully, listen carefully. Think well upon it and practice according to the dharma. The commentary says: From "The Buddha manifested supernatural powers" below, the fifth major section of the chapter clarifying benefits has two parts. First, separately clarifying the benefits obtained by four types of people. Second, from "good sons" below, generally raising that prajñā has benefits in the three times. In separately clarifying the four assemblies, there are four distinctions. First, gods and humans of the ten directions attaining Buddha-flower samādhi refers to the Flower Garland samādhi. The tenth stage attains this. Second, ten Ganges-sand bodhisattvas attain Buddha-body realization. Third, three Ganges-sand spirit kings of the eight divisions achieve the bodhisattva path from the first stage upward. Fourth, ten thousand women in their present bodies attain spiritual powers, namely the five spiritual powers. From "good sons" below, generally raising prajñā to clarify benefits in the three times. "Listen carefully,

listen carefully" below, the sixth major section of the chapter encourages relying on the three wisdoms and concludes by encouraging cultivation.

Chapter Seven: The Acceptance and Maintenance Chapter of the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra for Benevolent Kings Protecting the Nation

The commentary says: This chapter clarifies that the thirteen dharma teachers hearing the dharma and practicing it is called "acceptance," and not losing it for a long time is called "maintenance." From this the title is established, hence called the Acceptance and Maintenance Chapter. The six chapters of the main teaching are divided into four. Now this is the fourth, clarifying the virtuous conduct and characteristics of those who propagate the sūtra, encouraging future generations to rely upon and study the sūtra. The text has two parts: first, Moonlight's doubtful questions; from "Great Muni" below, second, the answer. Among the assembly's questions there are two parts: first, Moonlight generates doubt from the previous chapter; from "addressing the Buddha" below, second, properly questioning about dharma-maintaining people of the final age. In the previous doubtful questioning, first witnessing auspicious signs and having doubts, next immediately speaking and making inquiry.

At that time Moonlight thought in his mind and spoke: "I see Śākyamuni Buddha manifesting immeasurable spiritual powers, and also see Buddha Jewel-Full on the thousand-flower platform, who is the transformation-body master of all Buddhas. I also see Buddhas on the thousand flower-petal worlds, among whom each Buddha explains prajñāpāramitā." The commentary says: Speaking of Moonlight, his surname is Moon, his name is Prasenajit. Saying "Moonlight" means that after receiving the dharma, the character "Light" was additionally established. Hence called Moonlight. Next, speaking means seeing Śākyamuni's spiritual powers, also seeing Tathāgata Jewel-Full as transformation-body master, also seeing Buddhas on thousand petals each explaining prajñā. Are these three places' Buddhas one or different?

Addressing the Buddha he said: "Such immeasurable prajñāpāramitā cannot be explained, cannot be understood, cannot be known through consciousness. How can various good sons clearly comprehend and awaken in this sūtra, and according to dharma open the path of empty dharma for all sentient beings?" The commentary says: From "Addressing the Buddha saying" below is the proper question. Within this there are two parts: first properly questioning the extremely profound and immeasurable nature of the explained prajñā; next from "how" below, concluding the question's intent. In the previous proper question there are three phrases praising prajñā's profundity. First, transcending verbal expression, hence saying "cannot be explained" because the path of language is cut off. Second, transcending the realm of conceptual mind, hence saying "cannot be understood" because it is deep and inexhaustible. Third, transcending conscious observation, hence saying "cannot be known through consciousness" because it is not the realm of reasoning nor what conceptual consideration can reach. From "how" below next concludes the question's intent. The dharma's characteristics being thus, cutting off conditions and forgetting contemplation, how can one understand and cause all sentient beings to enter the empty path? Opening the empty dharma path means realizing the fundamental emptiness of existence, hence called "opening emptiness." Emptiness being able to penetrate is called "path." Hence called "opening the empty dharma path."

Great Muni said: "There are good sons who cultivate the thirteen contemplation gates and become great dharma kings. From the patience of practice to the diamond summit, all are dharma teachers. They maintain and establish [the dharma]. You great assembly should make offerings to them as if making offerings to Buddha. You should hold hundreds of millions of heavenly flowers and heavenly incense to offer them." The commentary says: From "Great Muni" below is the second Buddha's answer. There are three parts: first, properly answering the question. The thirteen contemplation gates means the three worthy stages and ten noble stages making thirteen. The previous four patiences each have three grades, making twelve. The lower patience of quiescence makes thirteen. From "patience of practice" below, second, distinguishing positions. Patience of practice means the nature of practicing. Reaching the diamond summit means the ten stages. Marking the beginning and raising the end, the middle eleven are briefly not completely

enumerated. Maintaining and establishing means clarifying that the thirteen types combined should be relied upon. "You all" third encourages the great assembly in dharma-appropriate offerings. The text saying "should be like offerings to Buddha" teaches their respectful reverence in offerings. Hence the Two Truths Chapter says: "With one thought believing in prajñā, know that this person is precisely the Tathāgata. How much more should the thirteen dharma teachers not receive Buddha-like offerings?"

Good sons, those dharma teachers are bodhisattvas of the practicing seed-nature. If laypeople, they are upāsakas and upāsikās; if renunciants, they are monks and nuns, cultivating the ten good deeds, contemplating their own bodies' earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness as individually impure. The commentary says: From "good sons, those dharma teachers" below is the second extensive answer about the thirteen patiences, forming thirteen sections. Regarding the initial patience of practice there are three parts. First clarifying inner ordinary beings' subduing patience. Initial practicing patience is the ten abodes. Regarding initial practicing patience there are eight sentences of sūtra text. First establishing the patience's name and position, the text saying "these are practicing seed-nature bodhisattvas." Second, separately clarifying the four assemblies. The two lay assemblies are called upāsakas and upāsikās. Some texts say upāsaka and upāsikā. Foreign language pronunciations differ, having these variations. Here they are called good dwelling men and good dwelling women, also called good sons and good daughters. The two renunciant assemblies: first called bhikṣu, meaning "destroyer of afflictions"; second called bhikṣuṇī, meaning "woman." Third, cultivating virtuous conduct, the text saying "cultivating the ten faiths" refers to the ten types of minds of lower subduing patience in the previous Teaching Chapter. The ten faiths are: first, the mind of vigor up to the tenth, the mind of dedication. Fourth, making the six great contemplations: the four elements, space, and consciousness.

Again contemplating the fourteen faculties, namely the five sense organs, five objects, male, female, mind, life, etc., having immeasurable faults and transgressions.

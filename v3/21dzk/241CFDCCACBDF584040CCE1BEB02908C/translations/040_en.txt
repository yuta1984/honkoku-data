"Relying on威力 and restricting my four groups of disciples" means creating secular laws beyond the five categories and seven groups to govern bhikṣus and others, causing the dharma-protecting good spirits to become angry and bring about illness, destroying the country and land, and increasing the five turbidities.

"Great King, in the final dharma age there will be bhikṣus and the four groups of disciples, and country kings and great ministers will each perform unlawful acts, wrongfully creating great unlawfulness toward the Buddha-dharma and saṅgha, creating various sins and transgressions, binding bhikṣus unlawfully and against the vinaya like the law for prisoners. At that time, the Dharma will perish before long." The commentary says: From "Great King, in the final dharma age" below. Third, one must not bind bhikṣus like the law for prisoners means that within the precept and vinaya dharma, at most there is only expelling the home-leaving assembly. Now practicing secular law. You should know the Dharma will perish before long.

"Great King, after my extinction in future ages, the four groups of disciples, various small country kings, crown princes and princes - those who are entrusted with protecting the Three Jewels will instead destroy the Three Jewels, like worms within a lion eating the lion itself, not outsiders. They will greatly damage my Buddha-dharma and incur great sins and transgressions. Right teaching will decline and the people will have no right conduct, gradually becoming evil with their lifespans daily decreasing to a hundred years. When people destroy the Buddha's teaching there will be no more filial children, the six relatives will not be harmonious, heavenly spirits will not protect, epidemic evil spirits will come daily to harm, disasters will connect end to end with calamities running rampant, and upon death they will enter hell, hungry ghost, and animal realms. If they emerge as humans, the karmic retribution of soldiers and slaves will be like an echo, like a shadow, like when someone writes at night and though the fire dies out the characters remain - the karmic retribution of the three realms is also like this." The commentary says: From "Great King, after my extinction" below. Fourth, admonishing the four groups and country kings, etc. All are people entrusted with upholding the Buddha-dharma who instead destroy themselves and cause various disasters to compete in arising in the country and land. All this is caused by destroying the Dharma. In the text there are two parts. First clarifying unlawful sūtra teaching. Second, from "Right teaching declines" below, clarifying the losses. First clarifying

unlawful sūtra teaching has three parts. First, dharma explanation. Second, from "like a lion" below, analogy. Third, from "greatly damaging" below, combining them.

Contemplate this.

"Great King, in future ages all country kings, crown princes, princes, and the four groups of disciples will wrongfully impose written records and restrictive precepts on Buddha's disciples like the law for laypeople, like the law for soldiers and slaves. If my disciples - bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs - establish registers to be used by officials, they are entirely not my disciples. This is the law of soldiers and slaves: establishing controlling officials to oversee monastic regulations, governing monastic registers, with great and small monastic controllers mutually restraining and binding like the law for prisoners and soldiers and slaves. At that time, the Buddha-dharma will not last long." The commentary says: From "Great King, in future ages" below, fifth, admonishing country kings, crown princes, and the four groups. Establishing registers and restrictions like the law for soldiers and slaves, establishing controlling officials to govern people like secular law. You should know the Buddha-dharma will perish before long.

"Great King, in future ages various small country kings and the four groups of disciples will create these sinful causes and conditions for destroying countries, and will personally receive them - this is not the Buddha, Dharma, or Saṅgha. Great King, in future ages when circulating this sūtra - the dharma vessels of the seven Buddhas, where the Buddhas of the ten directions constantly practice the Way - various evil bhikṣus will greatly seek fame and profit and in front of country kings, crown princes, and princes will speak of causes and conditions for destroying Buddha-dharma and destroying countries. Those kings, not discriminating, will believe and listen to these words, wrongfully creating legal restrictions not based on Buddha's precepts. This constitutes causes and conditions for destroying Buddha and destroying countries. At that time, the right Dharma will perish before long." The commentary says: From "Great King, in future ages various small country kings" below. Sixth, admonishing small countries and the four groups. Clarifying unlawful gains as sins. Restrict this and do not do it. Creating sins and transgressions oneself destroys the country and land. Personally receiving this does not concern the Three Jewels. "Great King, in future ages

circulating this sūtra" below. Seventh, admonishing various bhikṣus not to rely on the teachings of the seven Buddhas but to rely on Buddha-dharma to seek worldly fame and profit, going to country kings to speak of causes and conditions for destroying Buddha-dharma. The text has three parts. First clarifying bhikṣus and others wrongly explaining Buddha-dharma. Second, from "Those kings not discriminating" below, clarifying that country kings do not know the Three Jewels. Third, from "at that time" below, clarifying the extinction of right Dharma.

At that time the sixteen great country kings heard the Buddha's seven admonishments describing future events, wept and cried with grief, their voices shaking the three thousand [worlds], with sun, moon, five planets, and twenty-eight constellations losing their light and not appearing. Then the various country kings each wholeheartedly received and upheld the Buddha's words, not restricting the four groups of disciples from leaving home and practicing the Way, acting according to the Buddha's teaching. At that time the great assembly, eighteen Brahmā kings, and sons of the six desire [realm] gods all sighed and said: "At that time the world will be empty - this is an age without Buddha." At that time from the immeasurable great assembly, one hundred billion bodhisattvas including Maitreya and Lion-Moon, one hundred billion including Śāriputra and Subhūti, five hundred billion including the eighteen Brahmās, six desire [realm] gods, gods of the three realms and six paths, and asura kings, hearing the Buddha's explanation of causes and conditions for protecting Buddha-fruit and protecting countries and lands, experienced immeasurable joy, made prostrations to the Buddha, and received and upheld the Prajñāpāramitā. The commentary says: From "At that time the sixteen countries" below. The third major section within the chapter: the various country kings heard the Buddha's seven admonishments and did not restrict the four groups. Dividing the text into three parts. First, the sixteen country kings grieved, sighed, were startled and fearful, lamenting their past actions, and following the teaching did not restrict the four groups. Second, the eighteen Brahmā gods and others lamented saying: You should know that at that time there is no Buddha in the world - this laments the complete extinction of right Dharma, therefore called "no Buddha in the world." From "At that time the immeasurable great assembly" below. The fourth major section within the chapter: the assembly at that time heard the Dharma and joyfully practiced it. Dividing the text into three parts. First listing the assembly of one hundred billion bodhisattvas. Sec-

ond listing one hundred billion including Śāriputra and others. Third, five hundred billion including the gods of the form and desire realms, the six paths, asura kings and other assemblies all practiced accordingly.

In the first year of Keiō, in late October of the year of the Metal Ox, I obtained this ancient manuscript. Truly it is a rare treasure book of the world.

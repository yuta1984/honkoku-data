From the initial mind of good destinies to the position of nature seed nature, passing through two incalculable kalpas. The eighth concludes the name. The pāramitā position is called nature seed nature. The Tripiṭaka Master says: Translated by meaning as "guarding and protecting degrees." The various practices that are learned can be firmly guarded without loss. The Brahmajāla Sūtra has six names. In nature it is called nature seed nature. In firmness it is called dharma firmness. In patience it is called dharma patience. In wisdom it is called contemplative wisdom. In concentration it is called nature concentration. In contemplation it is called practice contemplation. I privately say: The meanings and names of the ten practices should be considered as usual.

Furthermore, the path seed nature dwells in firm patience, contemplating that all dharmas have no birth, no dwelling, no cessation. Namely, the five perceptions, three realms, and two truths have no self-other characteristics, and true suchness nature is ungraspable, therefore always entering the tenth, ultimate truth. Mind and mental factors are extinct yet receive birth in the three realms. Why? Because karmic habits and fruition reports are not yet exhausted, following the path. Again using three incalculable kalpas to cultivate eighty million pāramitās, one should attain the ground of equal sages. Therefore dwelling in the correct position of avaivartika. The commentary says: From "furthermore, path seed" below, the third clarifies supreme patience. There are six phrases: first establishing the name, second practical virtues, third contemplative understanding, fourth receiving birth for beings' sake, fifth the time period of cultivation, sixth concluding the position. First, establishing the name, called path seed nature. Second, practical virtues, the text says "dwelling in firm patience." This is precisely the ten firm minds from the previous Teaching Chapter. The ten firmnesses are: first, precept patience; second, knowledge and view patience; third, concentration patience; fourth, wisdom patience; fifth, liberation patience; sixth, three-realm cause-effect emptiness patience; seventh, wishless patience; eighth, signless patience; ninth, impermanence patience; tenth, all-dharma emptiness no-birth patience. Third, contemplative understanding, the text says "contemplating that all dharmas lack the three characteristics." Namely, through knowing that the five perceptions, three realms, and two truths have no self-other characteristics. True suchness nature is the nature of no-attainment and non-duality. Through knowing that all dharmas

are nothing, it says "ungraspable." The text saying "always entering the tenth, ultimate truth" refers to the previous five perceptions as five, three realms as eight, conventional truth as nine, ultimate truth as ten. Because it moves from the previous contemplation toward the later, it says "always entering the tenth, ultimate truth." Mind and mental factors being extinct means previously contemplating the no-birth of object-realms, now clarifying that the mind capable of conditions is also extinct. Fourth, receiving birth for beings' sake, the text says "yet receiving birth in the three realms." From "Why?" below explains the meaning of receiving birth. Because karmic habits are not yet exhausted. In the Bodhisattvabhūmi, the three worthy bodhisattvas receive birth in the three unfortunate destinies for beings' sake. Making beginningless vows as cause and great compassion as condition, generating vows to enter the three unfortunate destinies to teach and transform sentient beings. Fifth, clarifying the time period of cultivation, the text says "three incalculable kalpas." Cultivating eighty million various degrees, about to enter the first ground, therefore saying "should attain the ground of equal sages." Sixth, concluding the position. Avaivartika is correctly translated as "non-regression." Path seed nature, following the precedent, has six names. In nature it is called path seed nature. In firmness it is called firm cultivation. In patience it is called cultivation patience. In wisdom it is called cultivation wisdom. In concentration it is called wisdom concentration. In contemplation it is called direction contemplation. I privately say: The meanings and names of the ten dedications should be considered as usual.

Furthermore, Good Awakening Bodhisattva Mahāsattva dwells in equal patience, cultivating the four means of attraction, moment by moment not departing from mind, entering signless abandonment, extinguishing the greed and afflictions of the three realms. Regarding ultimate truth, yet not making it dharma-nature unconditioned. Because one conditions principle and extinguishes all characteristics, it becomes wisdom-conditioned cessation signless unconditioned. When dwelling in initial patience, future immeasurable birth and death do not cease through wisdom-conditions, therefore it is not wisdom-conditioned cessation signless unconditioned. Without self-other characteristics, signless and no-signlessness. The commentary says: From "furthermore, Good Awakening" below, next clarifies faith

patience. Regarding the first ground, there are again ten sections: first establishing the name, second praising the ground's virtues, third clarifying both emptiness and existence understanding, fourth extinguishing delusions, fifth attaining two unconditioned states, sixth understanding dharma skillful means, seventh clarifying the accomplishment of two wisdoms, eighth advancing in practice, ninth concluding the position, tenth using the four great treasuries to benefit beings. First, establishing the name, the text says "Good Awakening Bodhisattva." Second, praising virtuous practice, the text says "dwelling in equal patience." The first ground certifies faith; because it contemplates emptiness and existence together, it is called equal patience. Third, clarifying both emptiness and existence understanding, the text says "cultivating the four means of attraction." This is precisely existence understanding. From "entering the signless" below is precisely emptiness understanding. Fourth, extinguishing delusions, the text says "extinguishing the greed and afflictions of the three realms." Fifth, clarifying attainment of two unconditioned states, the text says "regarding the ultimate yet not two." "Extinguishing all characteristics" is analytical cessation unconditioned. From "dwelling in initial patience" below, future birth and death not arising is precisely non-analytical conditions cessation unconditioned. Without self and without other characteristics means: through self there is other; when self is absent, other is also absent. One absence eliminates self, one absence eliminates other. Two absences eliminate both, therefore called "no-signlessness."

Immeasurable skillful means all manifest. Contemplating true characteristic skillful means: regarding ultimate truth, neither sinking nor emerging, neither turning nor inverted. Universal learning skillful means: neither certifying nor not certifying, yet learning everything. Dedication skillful means: neither dwelling in fruition nor not dwelling in fruition, yet directing toward bodhisattva wisdom. Māra sovereignty skillful means: practicing Buddha path on non-path, unmoved by the four māras. One vehicle skillful means: regarding non-dual characteristics, penetrating all practices of sentient beings. Transformation skillful means: through vow-power, freely being born in all pure Buddha lands. The commentary says: Sixth, explaining dharma skillful means, the text has six sub-phrases: first, true characteristic skillful means up to transformation skillful means. First, true characteristic skillful means, the text says "regarding ultimate

【Lower section of left page】
truth, yet neither sinking nor emerging." The two vehicles sink into emptiness, ordinary beings sink into existence, moving and turning in inversion. Bodhisattvas regarding true characteristics have no sinking or emerging, therefore neither turning nor inverting. Second, universal learning skillful means, the text says "neither certifying nor not certifying." Because bodhisattvas contemplate emptiness and existence together, equally practicing non-duality, it says "neither certifying nor not certifying." "Yet learning everything" clarifies universally learning great and small, called "learning everything." Third, dedication skillful means, the text says "neither dwelling in fruition nor not dwelling in fruition, yet attaining sarvajña." There are three types of dedication: first, turning from cause toward fruition—dedicating all possessed good roots toward sarvajña fruition; second, turning from fruition toward cause—sharing with all sentient beings; third, dedicating toward impermanence—therefore separating from characteristics. "Not dwelling in fruition" means not dwelling in the fruitions of human, divine, or two-vehicle paths. "Not not-dwelling" means dwelling in the four types of fruition above the first ground: pliancy fruition, endeavor fruition, vow-wisdom fruition, and appropriation-reward fruition. Also, "not dwelling in fruition" means not dwelling in the four fruitions. "Not not-dwelling" means dwelling in sarvajña fruition. Fourth, māra sovereignty skillful means, the text says "practicing on non-path yet practicing Buddha path, unmoved by the four māras." Being the same as māra yet practicing Buddha path, māra cannot destroy it. This expresses two meanings: first, wanting to lead the deviant into the correct; second, clarifying that deviant and correct are non-dual. Understanding māra-activities as having no substance is precisely Buddha-activity. Fifth, one vehicle skillful means, the text says "regarding non-dual characteristics, penetrating all practices of sentient beings." Only practicing the one great vehicle non-dual dharma gate to transform sentient beings. Sixth, transformation skillful means, the text says "through vow-power freely being born in all pure Buddha lands." Arising bodily powers to benefit beings. Consider this.

Thus, good sons, this initial awakening wisdom regarding existence and non-existence characteristics yet not being two. This is true wisdom illuminating skillful application

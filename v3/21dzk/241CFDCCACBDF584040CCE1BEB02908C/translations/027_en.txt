Regarding the groups of spirits and ghosts: The Tripiṭaka Master says this appears in the "Sutra on the Meanings of the Golden-Eyed Sage." This sutra has not come from foreign countries. This sage leads various spirits and ghosts. The fundamental spirits and ghosts have ten groups. Within each group there are respectively ten groups. Hence it says "hundred groups." The fundamental ten are: First, great spirits, who can transform and create various spirits. Second, child spirits - children of Maheśvara. They violated sages, but the sage's law does not kill children. Therefore the sage predicted: "At age sixteen becoming a great sage, they will inevitably die." This word cannot be escaped. Maheśvara through his power dwells in this child, constantly at age fourteen. Using children as companions, they harm children in the world. If they reach age fifteen, this child no longer harms. Third, mother spirits - wet nurses of children. Fourth, Brahma spirits - Maheśvara, with three eyes on the face, possessing omniscience. If one loses something, by casting spells on a child's face, another eye grows, and one goes directly to take the object. Upon obtaining the object, the eye is lost again. Fifth, elephant-headed spirits, who enjoy obstructing others, wishing that all good and evil affairs not succeed. Sixth, dragon spirits, with much greed and anger. Seventh, rāra spirits, who enjoy violating humans and devas, having both good and evil warriors. Eighth, sand spirits, who eat meat, with meager fortune bodies like sandy soil. Ninth, yakṣa spirits, possessing great supernatural powers. Tenth, rākṣasa spirits, translated as "extremely difficult." Consider all this as the text states.

Great King, when nations are disturbed, first spirits and ghosts are disturbed; when spirits and ghosts are disturbed, therefore all people are disturbed; bandits come to rob the nation; the hundred surnames perish and are lost; ministers, lords, princes, kings' sons, kings, princes, and hundred officials together generate disputes; heaven and earth have strange anomalies; the twenty-eight constellations, stellar paths, sun and moon lose their timing and degrees, and many bandits arise. The commentary says: The second clarifies how the seven disasters properly destroy nations. The seven disasters are: first, spirit and ghost disasters; second, bandit disasters; third, disasters of ministers, lords, princes and hundred officials; fourth, disasters of the twenty-eight constellations. From "Great King" below, combining three disasters with the previous makes seven disasters.

○ The twenty-eight constellations are: Jiǎo, Kàng, Dǐ, Fáng, Xīn, Wěi, Jī - these are the eastern constellations. Dǒu, Niú, Nǚ, Xū, Wēi, Shì, Bì - these are the northern constellations. Kuí, Lóu, Wèi, Mǎo, Bì, Zī, Shēn - these are the western constellations. Jǐng, Guǐ, Liǔ, Xīng, Zhāng, Yì, Zhěn - these are the southern constellations. Each direction has seven. Four times seven makes twenty-eight constellations. "Losing degrees" means disorder in the above degree calculations, hence called "losing degrees." Sun and moon losing degrees means heaven has 365 and one-quarter degrees. The sun travels one degree per day, completing one circuit of heaven in one year. The moon travels thirteen and seven-nineteenth degrees per day, completing one circuit of heaven in one month. Moreover, in the heavenly path where sun and moon travel, there are immeasurable [variations]. Generally speaking, there are three paths: namely, on the winter solstice the sun travels the southern path, on the summer solstice it travels the northern path, and during spring and autumn equinoxes it travels the middle path. Consider this.

Great King, if there are fire disasters, water disasters, wind disasters, or any other disasters, one should also lecture and read this sutra. The methods are as explained above.

Great King, not only protecting the nation, there is also protective fortune - seeking wealth, noble rank and position, seven treasures as desired, safe travel, seeking sons and daughters, seeking wisdom and understanding and fame, seeking the fruition of the six heavens and the nine grades of fruition in the human realm - one should also lecture and read this sutra. The methods are as explained above. The commentary says: From "Great King, not only protecting the nation" below, the third clarifies the methods for protecting ministers, subjects and others. There are nine kinds of fortune: first, wealth; second, noble rank and position; third, seven treasures as desired; fourth, safe travel; fifth, sons and daughters; sixth, wisdom and understanding; seventh, fame; eighth, the fruits of the six heavens; ninth, the nine grades of fruition in the human realm. The nine grades refer to nine grades of people. Upper, middle, and lower each have three grades. Three times three makes nine types. The upper, middle, and lower of the upper grade are: upper grade is the comprehensive seed-nature of gold wheel kings; middle grade is the nature seed-nature of silver wheel kings.

Lower grade is the habitual seed-nature of copper wheel kings. The upper, middle, and lower of the middle grade are: upper grade is iron wheel kings; middle grade is scattered grain kings; lower grade is small nation kings. The upper, middle, and lower of the lower grade are: upper grade is kṣatriya great families; middle grade is brāhmaṇa great families; lower grade is householder great families, etc.

Great King, not only protecting fortune but also protecting various disasters - if there are illness and suffering disasters, fetters and shackles restraining the body, breaking the four grave prohibitions, creating causes of the five heinous crimes, committing the eight difficult circumstances' sins, performing affairs of the six realms - for all immeasurable sufferings and disasters, one should also lecture and read this sutra. The methods are as explained above. The commentary says: From "Great King, not only protecting fortune but also protecting various disasters" below, the fourth clarifies protection from disasters. There are eight disasters: first, illness and suffering disasters; second, fetter disasters; third, cangue disasters; fourth, yoke disasters; fifth, chain disasters; sixth, restraint and binding disasters; seventh, the four grave and five category [offenses], etc.; eighth, the five heinous crimes, etc. These five heinous crimes are killing father, killing mother, killing true person arhats, drawing Buddha's blood, breaking the harmonious sangha. Also the eight are: the three evil path disasters make three; fourth, disasters of being before or after Buddha; fifth, border land disasters; sixth, disasters of deafness, blindness, and muteness; seventh, disasters of worldly intelligence and eloquence; eighth, long-life heaven disasters. The first section clarifying the practices for protecting the nation is completed.

Great King, in former days there was a king - Śakra came to heaven for King Mūrdhagata, wanting to destroy his nation. At that time, the Heavenly King Śakra, following the methods of the seven Buddhas, arranged a hundred high seats, invited a hundred dharma teachers to lecture on prajñāpāramitā. Mūrdhagata immediately retreated, as explained in the Sin-Extinguishing Sutra. The commentary says: From "Great King, in former days" below, the second major section cites the past to compare with the present. Within this there are three parts: first citing King Śakra to establish that prajñā can protect nations, as the Nirvāṇa Sutra cites and explains this matter.

Great King, formerly there was a King of Tianluò who had a prince wanting to ascend to the royal throne. One was named Prince Spotted Foot, who received teachings from the heretical teacher Ratha that he should take a thousand kings' heads to sacrifice to the tomb spirit and ascend to the throne himself. Having already obtained nine hundred ninety-nine kings, lacking one king, he immediately traveled north ten thousand li and obtained one king named King Universal Brightness. That King Universal Brightness said to King Spotted Foot: "I wish to be granted one day to offer food to śramaṇas and pay homage to the Three Jewels." King Spotted Foot permitted this. During that one day, King Universal Brightness immediately followed the dharma of the past seven Buddhas, invited a hundred dharma teachers, arranged a hundred high seats, and for one day twice daily lectured on prajñāpāramitā's eight thousand million verses to completion. That first dharma teacher spoke verses for King Universal Brightness, saying: The commentary says: From "Great King, formerly Tianluò" below, the second cites King Universal Brightness as proof. The text has three parts: first clarifying the disaster situation; second, from "King Universal Brightness spoke to Spotted Foot" below, clarifying practicing merit according to the sutra and clarifying the practices for protecting the nation; third, from "At that time the dharma teacher" below, hearing dharma and attaining understanding. The first disaster situation is that Spotted Foot wanted to destroy various nations, take a thousand kings' heads to sacrifice to the tomb spirit. The textual meaning is clear and can be understood.

When kalpa-fire ends completely, heaven and earth blaze through. The commentary says: In explaining the verses, there are eight verses making four [groups]. The first two verses explain impermanence. The next two verses explain suffering. The next two lines explain emptiness. The next two verses explain no-self. "Heaven and earth blazing through" refers to what the "Sutra on the Original Arising of Creating Heaven and Earth" explains: heaven and earth's lifespan is two million kalpas. When lifespan ends, they are completely burned by kalpa-fire. [The fire] remains concentrated for seven days. After seven days pass, all under heaven blazes through. Consider this regarding the four kalpas.

The commentary also says: In the first two verses, the first two lines concern heaven and earth, the next two lines relate to mountains and seas, the next

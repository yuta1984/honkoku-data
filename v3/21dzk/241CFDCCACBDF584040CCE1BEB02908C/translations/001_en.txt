The Buddha's Teaching on the Benevolent King Sutra for Protection of the State through Prajñāpāramitā, Introductory Chapter One

Generally, collected interpretations are not identical but differ according to their respective schools. Zhiyi, the Great Master of Tiantai, selected five meanings from among various sutras. 《Note: 1. Explanation of names, 2. Sutra essence, 3. Sutra doctrine, 4. Sutra function, 5. Teaching characteristics.》 Within the explanation of names, there are also differences. Some establish names through single dharmas, some receive titles through single metaphors, some establish names through persons, some explain both dharma and metaphor, and some explain both person and dharma. Single dharma refers to cases like the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sutra, which establishes its name from the dharma of fruition. The Mahāprajñāpāramitā, Ten Stages, and Gradual Preparation receive their titles from causes. Single metaphor refers to sutras like the Withered Tree and Seven Carts Metaphor. Single person refers to sutras like the Seven Women and Old Woman. Those that explain both dharma and metaphor include the Avataṃsaka, Lotus, and Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā sutras. Those that explain both person and dharma include the Vimalakīrti, Śrīmālā, Four Heavenly Kings' Questions on Prajñā, and Benevolent King Prajñā sutras.

Buddha: Because one awakens oneself and awakens others, one is called Buddha.
Teaching: Because sacred words are appropriately expressed, it is called teaching.
Benevolent: Because one bestows grace and spreads virtue, one is called benevolent.
King: Because one rules and transforms with sovereignty, one is called king.
Protection of the State: The benevolent king is the protector (subject of protection), and the nation is the protected (object of protection). That is, when a benevolent king governs the Way according to the dharma, all people obtain peace and happiness, and the nation becomes tranquil. If the benevolent king is compared to prajñā, then prajñā is the protector of the benevolent king, and the king is the protected. Through upholding prajñā, the benevolent king becomes peaceful. It can also be said that the benevolent king is the protector

of prajñā. This is because the dharma exists through people. However, speaking generally, benevolent king prajñā is the protector, and the nation is the protected.

Prajñā: Prajñā means wisdom. The Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra contains two interpretations. Volume 33 states: "Prajñā in the Qin language means wisdom," and Master Kaishan Zang also uses this translation. In the Buddha-land language it is called prajñā, which is translated as wisdom. Volume 70 also states: "Prajñā cannot be称measured. Prajñā defines true reality and is extremely deep and weighty. Wisdom is light and shallow. Therefore it cannot be weighed." Master Zhuangyan Min, based on this passage, holds that the name prajñā contains five meanings, while wisdom is merely one aspect and is not a proper translation. The five meanings are: 1) wisdom, 2) transcendence (because it severs delusions and transcends characteristics), 3) purity (because its essence is free from defilement), 4) guidance (because it guides all practices), 5) illumination (because it has no darkness). The two masters engaged in debate. To reconcile this, there are two approaches. Prajñā has both conventional and ultimate aspects: translation applies to the conventional aspect, while non-translatability applies to the ultimate aspect. The commentary states: "To say it cannot be translated means that prajñā is neither ignorance nor wisdom, therefore it cannot be translated." The Vimalakīrti Sutra says: "Like the mental states of all sentient beings, teaching the dharma accordingly gives rise to wisdom-activity. Neither grasping nor rejecting, entering the gate of one characteristic gives rise to wisdom-activity." Previous interpretations of this passage claim "wisdom is understanding of existence, wisdom is understanding of emptiness," but how can this capture the meaning? Some discuss passages that call true wisdom 'knowledge' and interpret that wisdom is knowledge. In the Wisdom-Meaning Sutra, knowledge means wisdom. Consider this: First, the language of sutras and treatises is not uniform. The commentary states: "If we now again create fixed doctrinal explanations, we further increase attachment. Therefore, through non-fixed [teachings] that appear and disappear, we shake up the roots of birth and death and enable awakening to the true dharma. Hence non-fixed explanations provide great benefit. If one studies

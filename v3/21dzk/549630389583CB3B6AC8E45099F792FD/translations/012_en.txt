Through this, one is born among humans and attains the status of king, minister, or wealthy person, enjoying wealth and freedom. Even if there are good spiritual friends, one does not trust them, and due to greed, anger, and indulgence, one creates various sins extensively. Riding on this evil karma, once one enters the three evil paths, even after countless eons when one emerges from hell, one receives a body of poverty and low status. If one does not meet good spiritual friends, one falls back into hell. Transmigrating in this way until today, all people are like this. This is called the difficult practice path.

Next, in the text explaining the meaning of the easy practice path, it says: Since ordinary beings lack power, they should simply concentrate exclusively on mindfulness of Amida Buddha and immediately attain samādhi. Because the practice is accomplished, attaining birth by concentrating the mind at the time of death is certain without doubt. After seeing Amida Buddha and realizing the patience of non-birth, one returns to the three realms, and riding on the patience of non-birth, saves suffering sentient beings and extensively performs Buddha-work with complete freedom according to one's will. Therefore the treatise says that "playing at the gates of hell" means after being born in that land,

【Page 22, Lower Section】
after being born and attaining the patience of non-birth, one returns to the lands of birth and death, teaches and transforms hell-beings, and saves suffering sentient beings. With this causation, if one seeks to be born in the Pure Land, one should understand that teaching. Therefore, it is said in the Commentary on the Ten Stages that this is called the easy practice path. Particularly, when the Master made decisive commentary on the Contemplation Sūtra, he established the two distinctions of "before transformation" and "arousing aspiration." This is the heart of these two gates. Therefore, since both our own school and other schools distinguish the entire teaching period into two gates, there can be no disagreement that the various gates of the Holy Path correspond to the practice of sages, while the single practice of nembutsu responds to what ordinary beings should cultivate. Therefore, when we consider our own spiritual capacity, if we do not partake in the portion of the three vehicles, taking refuge in the easy practice that ordinary beings can endure should be the essential path of definite liberation. The two distinctions of "before transformation" and "arousing aspiration" mean that the various teachings before the transformation of the entire period benefit sages, while the nembutsu taught in the Contemplation Sūtra embraces ordinary beings. This means that Śākyamuni's appearance in the world and his teaching of the 84,000 dharma gates was to make the three vehicles and five vehicles equally awaken to the principle-nature of the one true suchness. However, while those of sharp faculties

【Page 23, Upper Section】
all gained benefit, those of dull faculties and no wisdom find awakening difficult, so for those of inferior capacity, the Pure Land gate is opened, teaching them to ride on the Buddha's vow-power, be born in the Pure Land, and attain the enlightenment of non-birth in the Pure Land. This meaning appears in the introductory section of the Profound Meaning. Namely, it says that suchness is vast and extensive—even the five vehicles cannot fathom its extent; dharma-nature is deep and lofty—even the ten sages cannot exhaust its limit. Yet it explains that this principle-nature of suchness does not leave the minds of even the most lowly beings, and ordinary beings and sages are equally perfect. However, it says that because defilement and obstructions cover deeply, there is no way for the pure essence to manifest clearly. To reveal this pure essence, concealing the great compassion's western transformation and being startled to enter the gate of the burning house—from this point on describes the original intention of Śākyamuni's appearance in the world and clarifies the teaching period of the one period and five vehicles. Up to the point where it says that those who follow conditions all receive liberation, it clarifies the teaching benefits of those five vehicles and 84,000 [dharma gates]. This is the heart of the Holy Path gate. Next, from saying "However, sentient beings' obstructions are heavy and those who attain awakening are difficult to discern," it discusses the essential purpose of the Contemplation Sūtra's arising

and transformation. This is where Śākyamuni opened and explained the essential gate of meditative and non-meditative practices, showing the principle of calming thoughts, concentrating the mind, abandoning evil and cultivating good, and Amida manifested the great vows of his special intention, causing both good and evil ordinary beings to all accomplish the benefits of riding on the great vow. This is the heart of the Pure Land gate. Understanding the two gates distinguished in this way, when viewed through the meaning of "no way for the pure essence to manifest clearly," the benefit of "those who follow conditions all receive liberation" is a partial benefit. It is understood that this is not the stage of realization where the pure essence truly manifests clearly. This is because the world has reached the final age and people are of inferior faculties. Also in the commentary on the Contemplation Methods, it says that Śākyamuni appeared to save ordinary beings of the five turbidities, immediately using great compassion to reveal that the ten evils as cause result in the suffering of the three evil paths as karmic retribution, and also using equal wisdom to turn humans and devas around and make them realize entry into birth in Amida's Buddha-land. It appears that the original intention of Śākyamuni's appearance in the world was to teach Amida's teaching in order to save ordinary beings. The question is asked: According to the commentary in the first volume of Wenju, it says "Only the faculties of the three vehicles can stimulate the Buddha's appearance in the world; others cannot stimulate it." However, how can it be said that he appeared for the sake of ordinary beings? The answer is: The original [intention] of appearing in the world

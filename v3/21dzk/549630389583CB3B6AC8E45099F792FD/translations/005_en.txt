The conventional truth means contemplating these three thousand dharmas as existent. The middle truth means contemplating these three thousand dharmas as neither existent nor empty. Similarly, in the commentary of the Hongjue it says: "Because mind-nature is unmoving, we provisionally establish the name 'middle.' Because we eliminate the three thousand, we provisionally establish the designation 'empty.' Though eliminated, they still exist, so we provisionally establish the designation 'conventional.'" This is that passage. The meaning of the text is: "eliminating the three thousand" is the contemplation of emptiness. "Though eliminated, they still exist" is the contemplation of the conventional. That meaning is easy to see. In explaining the meaning of neither existence nor emptiness of the middle way contemplation, "mind-nature is unmoving" means that the mind-nature of sentient beings is originally the substance of neither existence nor emptiness and is inconceivable, therefore it is explained thus. In the first volume of the Shijian it says: "If one tries to say 'existent,' then there is absolutely no single thought-moment—how much less would there be the substantial forms of the ten realms? If one tries to say 'non-existent,' then again one gives rise to thoughts and considerations of the three thousand—how much less the mental considerations of a single realm? Because one cannot use these thoughts of existence and non-existence, therefore the mind of one thought-moment is coolly serene in the middle way." This is that meaning. These three truths mutually have the function of dual negation and dual

illumination. Dual negation means: emptiness breaks existence, existence breaks emptiness, and the middle way breaks both emptiness and existence. Dual illumination means: though these three truths mutually negate each other, they still clearly exist, so there is nothing to be broken and nothing to be grasped—they are perfectly interpenetrating without obstruction and inconceivable. This is called the perfectly interpenetrating three truths, and is called "three truths yet one truth, neither three nor one"—they are three truths yet also one truth. They are neither three truths nor one truth. Because sentient beings do not know the principle of these three truths, they have been transmigrating in birth-and-death since beginningless time. The principle of the three truths is precisely the one principle of the true-suchness dharma-realm. True-suchness is buddha-nature. It is also called dharma-nature, dharmakaya, ultimate truth, or tathāgatagarbha. These are all different names for one dharma. The principle of this true-suchness dharma-realm cannot be sought far away elsewhere. Since it is simply these three thousand dharmas, hell is also true-suchness, hungry ghosts are also true-suchness. If we call true-suchness the true Buddha, then it is clear that all ten realms are the buddha realm. Among the thousand suchnesses of the six paths, "such cause" is the path of karma, "such condition" is the path of afflictions, "such

effect" is the path of suffering. Since these are all the substance of true-suchness and true aspect, the three paths of afflictions, karma, and suffering are precisely the three virtues of dharmakaya, prajñā, and liberation. They are also the three bodies of dharma, reward, and response. When one contemplates and realizes thus, afflictions are precisely enlightenment, birth-and-death is precisely nirvana. When practitioners of the perfect and sudden cultivate the contemplation of these three truths, from ordinary beings of thin spiritual capacity to the ultimate stage of wondrous enlightenment, there are the sequential stages of the six identities. The six identities are: first, principle identity; second, name-and-word identity; third, contemplative practice identity; fourth, approximate identity; fifth, partial-true identity; sixth, ultimate identity. Principle identity means the stage where one possesses the principle of the three truths in one mind, but does not know that principle. This is precisely the ordinary person. In the first volume of Zhiguan, explaining this stage: "The mind of one thought-moment is precisely the principle of the tathāgatagarbha. Because of 'suchness,' it is identical with emptiness. Because of 'storehouse,' it is identical with conventionality. Because of 'principle,' it is identical with the middle. The three wisdoms are complete within one mind and are inconceivable." All lowly ordinary people are at this stage. Name-and-word identity means the stage where one hears the names and words of the three truths and understands them slightly, but has not yet reached contemplative understanding. In the same commentary it says: "Either following good

【Page 9, Lower Section】
teachers or following sutras, hearing the one real enlightenment explained above, and within names and words achieving penetrating understanding, realizing that all dharmas are Buddha-dharma." Even among those who would study this school well, reaching this stage should be considered precious. Contemplative practice identity means precisely the stage of cultivating the contemplative practice of the three truths. At this stage there are the five grades. The five grades are: first is the stage of possessing the ten minds complete. The ten minds are: first, contemplating the inconceivable realm; second, arousing compassion; third, skillfully stabilizing calm and insight; fourth, breaking through all dharmas universally; fifth, recognizing what is passable and what is blocked; sixth, cultivating the factors of the path; seventh, applying antidotes and auxiliary methods; eighth, knowing the sequential stages; ninth, being able to patiently endure; tenth, having no attachment to dharmas. The second is the stage of reciting sutras. That is, reciting the Lotus Sutra. The third is the stage of additionally engaging in teaching the dharma. The fourth is the stage of practicing the six perfections as a secondary practice. The fifth is the stage of properly practicing the six perfections. This is the stage of the outer ordinary person. Approximate identity means the stage of purification of the six sense faculties. In the sixth chapter of the Lotus Sutra, the Chapter on the Merit of Dharma Teachers: "All the dharmas he expounds, following their meaning and purport, all accord with true reality and do not

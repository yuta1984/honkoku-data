face. In China, Daruma did not recognize [him]. In our land, Hōtō Kokushi, the founding master of Yura, entered Song China and met with Ōryū Mumon to receive the Dharma transmission. Priest Enhō Enni entered Song China and met with Keisan Mujun to receive the Dharma transmission. Eihei Dōgen entered Song China and met with Tendō Nyojō to receive the Dharma transmission. Daitō, the founding master of Daitoku-ji, was the fifth-generation descendant of Shōgen. Priest Daikaku, the founding master of Kenchō-ji, was a renowned philosopher of the Song dynasty.

　　　Pure Land School
The Pure Land School achieves direct bodily Buddhahood and is the practice of those with the highest spiritual capacity. For the dull-witted people of the latter age, it would be easier to first be born in the Pure Land and then attain Buddhahood. Relying on Amida's original vow power, they exclusively seek Pure Land practices with joy. Therefore it is called the Pure Land School. In Getshi (India), our predecessor Great Awakened One expounded the three Pure Land sutras. Bodhisattva Vasubandhu composed the "Treatise on Rebirth in the Pure Land," observing that "the characteristics of that world surpass the path of the three realms." Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva composed the "Ten Stages Vibhāṣā Treatise," stating "If a person wishes to become Buddha, let the mind contemplate Amida" and "one thought, ten thoughts." Tripiṭaka Bodhiruci transmitted and translated the Pure Land treatise. Using the three sutras and one treatise as foundation, it was brought to China with Tanluan, Daochuo, and Shandao as patriarchs. In our land, Master Genkū of Kurodani is the patriarch. Among his disciples are the Seizan school's immediate rebirth and the Chinzei school's eventual rebirth. Genkū himself opened the Tripiṭaka and first established the Pure Land gate. (Genkū was called Hōnen.)

Walking Ship Notes (Original)
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Described by Priest Zonkaku

The various teachings of one Buddha's lifetime are divided in different ways, and the discussions of the various schools are each distinct. Though they are distinct, the ultimate principle to which they return is unified. All seek to separate from birth and death to realize nirvana, and to overturn delusion to attain enlightenment. Looking at a verse from the writings left by Tripiṭaka Guṇavarman: "Though the various treatises are each heterodox, in practice there are not two principles. If one is attached there are rights and wrongs, but for those who understand, there are no disputes." Truly, those who have wisdom and understanding and are well-versed in the great meaning of the Buddha-dharma should have no attachments. However, because spiritual capacities differ infinitely, Buddhist teachings are also infinitely varied. If each person practices according to the teaching to which they have affinity, they should quickly attain liberation. Among these, what are called the four schools of Mahāyāna are Yogācāra, Madhyamaka, Huayan, and Tiantai. In addition to these, adding Shingon, Abhidharma, Satyasiddhi, and Vinaya makes eight schools. Adding the Buddha-mind school makes nine schools. Adding the Pure Land school makes

ten schools. These are the schools that have spread in Japan. All of these various schools emerge from the teachings of one Buddha and are all gates that should lead completely to unsurpassed bodhi.

1. The essence of the Yogācāra school is to establish the three-period teaching of existence, emptiness, and the middle way, treating the two teachings of existence and emptiness as expedient means, and taking the middle way teaching as the truth. The existence teaching discusses that persons are empty while dharmas exist. This is what is taught in the Āgama and other Hīnayāna sutras. The emptiness teaching explains that both persons and dharmas are empty. The various Prajñāpāramitā texts clarify this point. The middle way teaching reveals the profound meaning of neither existence nor emptiness. The Huayan, Saṃdhinirmocana, and other Mahāyāna sutras represent this. That profound principle of the middle way is the doctrine of consciousness-only and mind-only. The Huayan Sutra teaches "The three realms are only one mind; there is no separate dharma outside of mind," and the Saṃdhinirmocana Sutra teaches "The objects of the various consciousnesses are only manifestations of consciousness" - this is that meaning. Regarding this consciousness-only, there is something called the five levels of consciousness-only. Those five levels are: first, abandoning the false and maintaining consciousness that appreciates; second, discarding the mixed and retaining pure consciousness; third, gathering the branches and returning to root consciousness; fourth, concealing the inferior and manifesting superior consciousness; fifth, eliminating characteristics and realizing essence consciousness. The false and

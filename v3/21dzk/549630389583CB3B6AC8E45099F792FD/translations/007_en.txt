Also, in the commentary by Great Master Nanyue: "The formless peaceful practice is profound wondrous meditation, contemplating the six sense faculties. The formed peaceful practice, according to the Encouragement Chapter, involves reciting the Lotus with a scattered mind, not entering meditative samādhi, but in sitting, standing, and walking, single-mindedly recollecting the words of the Lotus. If this practice is accomplished, one immediately sees the body of Samantabhadra. This also provisionally divides into two types of people, but ultimately speaking, the two practices mutually manifest each other." The practitioners of formed and formless practices differ in their characteristics provisionally, but when discussed ultimately, the principle that both practices should be complete is evident. Even if one receives, maintains, and recites without contemplative understanding, when the sutra explains the standards for practitioners of peaceful conduct, those behavioral patterns are extremely difficult to maintain. These characteristics are explained in detail in the Peaceful Practices Chapter: "Always avoid kings, princes, ministers and officials, dangerous entertainers, caṇḍālas, non-Buddhist brahmins. Also do not associate with those of increasing pride, those attached to the Lesser Vehicle, scholars of the Tripiṭaka, monks who break precepts, nominal arhats, nuns, those fond of joking and laughter, those deeply attached to the five desires, or laywomen seeking present extinction." This is that passage. Also, according to our school's understanding, as explained in the Śamatha-vipaśyanā, in practicing this sutra, five conditions should be complete. The five conditions are: first, sufficiency of clothing and food; second, maintaining pure precepts; third, constantly dwelling in quiet places; fourth, ceasing all worldly affairs; fifth, obtaining good spiritual

friends. Among the five conditions, if even one is lacking, it becomes difficult to accomplish the way and difficult to obtain merit. Particularly, the Lotus and nembutsu are both teachings of the buddha-wisdom One Vehicle, so their essence is one. However, the Lotus is taught for the sages, while nembutsu is taught for the ordinary. Because what is directed toward the two capacities of ordinary and sage differs, the two paths of difficult and easy practice are distinguished. If those with heavy karmic obstacles and dull faculties find it difficult to concentrate on formless contemplative understanding and cannot practice according to the teaching, they should especially strive in the easy practice of nembutsu and quickly be born in the easily-reached Pure Land. Moreover, Great Master Tiantai also composed commentaries on the Contemplation Sutra, wrote the Ten Doubts, recommended Amida's beneficial activity to others, and himself aspired for birth in the Land of Peace and Nourishment. Therefore, even when studying Tiantai's doctrinal texts, one should recollect Amida, and even when hoping to receive the great benefits of the Lotus, one should have faith in the Original Vow.

1. The Shingon school is the supreme peak of all teachings, the superior vehicle of esoteric doctrine. All the schools mentioned above are the revealed teachings expounded by Śākyamuni. Now this Shingon teaching is the secret dharma of Mahāvairocana Tathāgata's self-enjoyment and inner realization, so those of shallow practice who have not reached the stage of ordination and abhiṣeka do not transmit the profound secrets. Even those who do transmit them do not openly explain them. If one were to explain them, it would be called the fault of transgressing the samaya vows and would invite serious sin, so one cannot speak of them carelessly. How much more so for those who originally do not know and have not received transmission. Both the ability to teach and what is taught are not easy matters. However, by analogical understanding based on the principle of the Perfect school mentioned earlier, I shall indicate just one aspect: in this teaching there is a distinction between ritual practice (jisō) and doctrinal understanding (kyōsō). First, ritual practice means the sequence of cultivation transmitted from Mahāvairocana through Vajrasattva, transmitted from teacher to disciple, not deviating in a single matter from the prescribed methods of mudrās, mantras, and other procedures, learning and practicing these. This

means that even without understanding the underlying principles, if one follows the prescribed forms and practices diligently according to the dharma, the accomplishments (siddhi) will be achieved and one will obtain benefits in this life and the next. The Mahāvairocana Sutra says: "If one wishes to enter accomplishment in this very life, contemplate according to what is appropriate. Personally receive the luminous dharma from the honored one's presence, contemplate correspondingly and achieve accomplishment." This is that meaning. Next, doctrinal understanding means comprehending the fundamental tenets established in this teaching, understanding the profound depths of the three principal texts, studying the doctrinal principles in the commentaries and beyond, and receiving the secret instructions. Generally, the principle of this school discusses how Mahāvairocana Tathāgata is the master of both realms and the chief of all honored ones. The two realms are the Womb Realm and the Diamond Realm. The Womb is principle, the Diamond is wisdom. These are precisely the two dharmas of concentration and insight. In the Womb Realm, there are the eight-petaled lotus dais, thirteen great courts, and countless sacred assemblies. In the Diamond Realm, there are the thirty-seven honored ones and the various honored ones of the nine assembly maṇḍalas. Discussed in detail, in the Womb Realm there are 470 honored ones, in the Diamond Realm there are over 500 honored ones. These are precisely all the honored ones of the ten directions and dharma realm, infinite and without remainder, completely encompassed within these two realms. Now, where do these honored ones reside? Rather than seeking them far away elsewhere,

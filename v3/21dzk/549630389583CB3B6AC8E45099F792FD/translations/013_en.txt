Regarding exploring the intention, what is discussed in the two schools of Holy Path and Pure Land should differ. Tendai's interpretative doctrine represents the view of the Holy Path gate. When speaking from the heart of the Pure Land gate: since it is difficult for ordinary beings to attain realization when cultivating the practices of the Holy Path's three vehicles, what embraces those of heavy obstructions and dull faculties who are left out of the teaching benefits of the entire period's 84,000 [dharma gates] is the single practice of nembutsu—this is seen as the original intention of this gate. The current commentary on Contemplation Methods, as well as the commentary on Profound Meaning, etc., express this heart. The great compassion of all Buddhas is directed toward those who suffer. The heart exclusively has pity and mindfulness for constantly drowning sentient beings. Therefore, they encourage and cause them to take refuge in the Pure Land. Also, as for those who are like people drowning in water, one should urgently and exclusively save them. As for those on the shore, what need is there to save them?—this is it. Therefore, regarding the entire teaching period, one should understand these two gates, reflect on one's own spiritual capacity, and take refuge in nembutsu. However, what is called the difficult practice path and the Holy Path gate means that when one cultivates and enters through self-power, there are successes and failures in cultivation, whether due to sharp or dull faculties, or due to shallow or deep practice.

There is slow and fast in attaining awakening. However, both shallow and deep are self-power. Slow and fast are equally difficult practice. For sages, it should not be difficult to practice. When compared to ordinary beings, all is difficult practice. Because it is the path practiced by sages, it is called the Holy Path, so the principle is clear that it should be difficult practice for ordinary beings. What is called the easy practice path and the Pure Land gate means setting aside the cultivation path of this land and aspiring for birth in the Pure Land. In contrast to the difficult practice of the Holy Path, it is called the easy practice path, and in opposition to the path of cultivation and entry in the present body, it is called the Pure Land birth gate. All of this is to make it suitable for ordinary beings. Therefore, regarding the teaching appropriate for ordinary beings, those of inferior capacity in the final age should fundamentally practice this. Regarding this Pure Land gate, although both miscellaneous practices and nembutsu both teach the benefit of birth in one round, within this, nembutsu is made the original vow and the Name is made the cause of birth. In the so-called Larger Sūtra, it teaches the distinctions among the three grades of spiritual capacity, yet commonly for all it says "single-mindedly and exclusively be mindful of the Buddha of Immeasurable Life." In the Contemplation Sūtra, it reveals the three gates of meditative, non-meditative, and great vow practices, yet entrusts the single dharma of the Name. In the Smaller Sūtra, it selects and teaches the nembutsu

single practice, and all Buddhas bear witness to it. Therefore, what is taught in all three sūtras prioritizes nembutsu, and the true cause of birth fundamentally takes exclusive practice as its basis. This exclusive practice means not placing the mind on liberation through various teachings, but establishing mindfulness in the single practice of nembutsu, simply believing deeply in the original vow, single-mindedly reciting the Name, and not mixing in even one thought of doubt. The detailed essence of this school appears in the three wonderful scriptures as well as in the Master's interpretations, etc. There is no need to elaborate on this now. Those who have aspiration should open and study them. Among the three-part sūtras, the upper volume of the Larger Sūtra teaches the forty-eight great vows, clarifying the compassionate vows of the causal stage, and the lower volume praises the deep and vast Buddha-wisdom, manifesting the merit of the result stage. Therefore, clearly manifesting Amida's benefiting of beings is found in this sūtra. Therefore, when the Master also distinguishes the three gates of meditative, non-meditative, and great vow practices, in interpreting the great vow, he says "the great vow is as taught in the Larger Sūtra," explaining the principle that both good and evil ride equally. In the Contemplation Sūtra, it determines that capacity as the capacity harmed by the thieves of afflictions, and within the meditative and non-meditative texts

it nevertheless highlights nembutsu. In the Amida Sūtra, it does not mix in the expedient means of meditative and non-meditative various practices, but teaches exclusively the single practice of name-recitation. Therefore, at this time, all Buddhas provided unanimous testimony, and it was taught that this was Śākyamuni's fundamental practice from his ordinary stage. Thus, through what is taught in the three sūtras, the profound meaning of the single teaching is accomplished.

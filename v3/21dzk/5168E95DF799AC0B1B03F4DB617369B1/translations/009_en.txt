The emptiness of the mundane world still brings order to the disorder of false thoughts. When one explains the emptiness of the profound supramundane Benevolent Kings Sutra, it brings order to the disorder of false thoughts of all sentient beings and protects against national disorder. This is not an inconceivable matter for sentient beings." 《Marginal note: Above》

　　　The Inconceivable Matter of How the Benevolent Kings Sutra Protects Countries, Dispels Disasters, Attracts Blessings, and Also Fulfills All Sentient Beings' Prayers and Wishes

The Chapter on Protecting Countries says: "Great King, when countries are in disorder, spirits and demons are in disorder. Because spirits and demons are in disorder, all people are in disorder. Bandits come to plunder the country and the people perish. Ministers, rulers, crown princes, princes, and all officials together give rise to disputes. There are strange phenomena in heaven and earth. The twenty-eight constellations, star paths, sun and moon lose their time and degree. Many bandits arise. Whether water disasters, fire disasters, wind disasters, or all kinds of disasters, one should also lecture and read this sutra. Not only does it protect the country, but one also gains merit. When seeking wealth, honor, official positions, and the seven treasures, they come as one wishes. When lecturing and reading this sutra, Great King, not only does one gain merit, but also protection from various difficulties. If bound by illness, suffering, wooden instruments of punishment, shackles and chains; if one has violated the four grave prohibitions, created causes for the five heinous crimes, committed the sins of the eight difficulties and engaged in affairs of the six paths—for all countless sufferings and difficulties, one should also lecture and read this sutra." 《Marginal note: Above》 Thus the principle of Benevolent Kings Prajñā takes emptiness as its essence. Since emptiness has no seven treasures, why does it rain the seven treasures? Also, since emptiness has neither male nor female, why does it rain males and females? Regarding this puzzling matter, Śākyamuni's influence declares: "Benevolent Kings Prajñā takes contemplating emptiness as its essence. Emptiness is the wish-fulfilling jewel treasury of emptiness. Therefore, from the wish-fulfilling jewel treasury of prajñā, wish-fulfilling jewels, mundane and supramundane treasures rain according to one's wishes like autumn rain in the forest. Therefore, my former explanation of the Benevolent Kings Sutra says: 'When lecturing and reading this sutra and seeking wealth, honor, official positions, and the seven treasures, they come and go as one wishes. When seeking males and females, seeking wisdom and fame, seeking the fruition rewards of the six heavens and

the nine grades of fruition rewards in the human realm, one should also lecture and read this sutra.'" 《Marginal note: Above》 Therefore, when lecturing and reading Benevolent Kings Prajñā, there are no treasures that do not rain from the wish-fulfilling precious jewel of prajñā's emptiness. The wealth treasuries of elders and laymen rain from the wish-fulfilling precious jewel of Benevolent Kings Prajñā's emptiness. The positions of great ministers, officials, and leaders rain from the wish-fulfilling precious jewel of Benevolent Kings Prajñā's emptiness. Seeking good men and good women rains from the wish-fulfilling precious jewel of Benevolent Kings Prajñā's emptiness. When men seek women, it is like a magician producing males and females. If one turns toward Benevolent Kings Prajñā seeking wisdom and fame, the treasure storehouse of sharp faculties, keen listening, wisdom, fame, and sharp faculties rain and gush forth like rain and springs from the wish-fulfilling jewel of Benevolent Kings Prajñā's emptiness. Also, when lecturing and reading Benevolent Kings Prajñā, because the fruition rewards of the six heavens rain and gush forth from the wish-fulfilling precious jewel of prajñā's emptiness, the merit rewards of the Four Heavenly Kings, Vaiśravaṇa Heaven, and Vaiśālī City rain and gush forth from the wish-fulfilling jewel of Benevolent Kings Prajñā. The joyful fruition rewards of Trayastriṃśa Heaven, Sudarśana City, Indra, and the thirty-three heavens rain and gush forth from the wish-fulfilling precious jewel of the Benevolent Kings Sutra. In Tuṣita Heaven's inner court, in the Lotus Sutra court's forty-nine courtyards, Maitreya the future guide, the compassionate honored one's emergence in the world, and the joy of self-received dharma rain and gush forth from the wish-fulfilling precious jewel of the Benevolent Kings Sutra. The sixth heaven's demon king, the birth deity of all sentient beings, the ninety-nine-story maṇi jewel palace, the supreme fruition rewards revered by all heavens above the clouds 《Marginal note: [Red] The character "from" may be missing after "rewards"》 rain and gush forth from the wish-fulfilling precious jewel of the Benevolent Kings Sutra. The nine grades of fruition rewards in the human realm rain and gush forth from the wish-fulfilling precious jewel of the Benevolent Kings Sutra. The hundreds and thousands of treasuries of human elders and laymen, the seven precious treasure stores of kings and great ministers, the wheel-turning sage kings and flying emperors flying around the emptiness of the four continents, circling the countless worlds on the four sides of Mount Sumeru, with the seven treasures having a thousand and four sons surrounding them before and after—these excellent fruition rewards rain and gush forth from the wish-fulfilling precious jewel of Benevolent Kings Prajñā

Sutra, which is inconceivable. Also, near the precious wish-fulfilling jewel among the seven treasures of the wheel-turning king, within one yojana all disasters cannot approach. Near the wish-fulfilling precious jewel of Benevolent Kings Prajñā, there are no fire disasters, no water disasters, no wind disasters, no all kinds of disasters, no illnesses and sufferings, no sufferings of being bound by wooden punishment devices, shackles and chains. Also, near the wish-fulfilling precious jewel of Benevolent Kings Prajñā, there are no those with the karmic obstructions of violating the four grave prohibitions, no those who commit the sins of the eight difficulties, no those with the karmic obstructions of six-path transmigration. The Benevolent Kings Prajñā protecting countries and benefiting sentient beings takes sole leadership among all sutras and is truly excellent. 《Marginal note: Above》 Śākyamuni's influence on the secret dharma of the Benevolent Kings is thus precious and venerable.

　　　The Matter of the Benevolent Kings Sutra Protecting the Country of Trayastriṃśa Heaven

The Chapter on Protecting Countries says: "In former days there was a king. When Śakra Devānām Indra was about to destroy his country due to King Mūrdhagata's ascent 《Marginal note: [Investigation] Above and below probably have the character 'heaven' in the sutra》, Indra immediately, according to the dharma usage of the seven buddhas, 《Marginal note: [Investigation] The character 'spread' follows 'usage' in the sutra》 set up one hundred high seats, invited one hundred dharma masters, and lectured on Prajñāpāramitā. Mūrdhagata immediately retreated." 《Marginal note: Above》 Śākyamuni's influence declares: "Formerly there was a wheel-turning king named King Mūrdhagata. He was born from a mark on his father's head, so he was named Mūrdhagata (Crown-born). Mūrdhagata grew up to become a wheel-turning king and ruled the four continents but was not satisfied. He flew up to Trayastriṃśa Heaven to drive out Indra and wanted to become the king of Sudarśana City. He manifested a tall, great body and sat alongside the heavenly Indra. The assembly of thirty-three heavens saw two Indras and did not know which was the real heavenly Indra. At that time heavenly Indra [two characters missing in rectangular space] decreed in the Hall of Good Dharma to lecture on the Prajñā Sutra. King Mūrdhagata fell upside down to the human realm." This shows that the Benevolent Kings Prajñā Sutra has five kinds of protective deities called the Five Great Wisdom Kings. The Five Great Wisdom Kings are: Trailokyavijaya

Wisdom King, Kuṇḍali Wisdom King, Yamāntaka Wisdom King, Vajrayakṣa Wisdom King, and Great Saint Acala Wisdom King. Day and night they protect believers in the Benevolent Kings Sutra, dispelling disasters externally and attracting merit internally. Also, the 6.44 billion characters of the Prajñā Sutra each transform into vajra sharp swords that fly and scatter through empty space, cutting down the enemies of believers in the Benevolent Kings Sutra. There are no opponents to the Benevolent Kings Prajñā's protection of countries and sentient beings. 《Marginal note: Above》 How precious, how precious!

　　　The Matter of King Puṇyaraśmi Lecturing on the Benevolent Kings Sutra, Escaping Great Disaster, and Protecting His Country

Śākyamuni's influence's sacred writing states: The Chapter on Protecting Countries of the Benevolent Kings Sutra says: "Formerly there was King Devarāja who had one crown prince who wanted to ascend to the royal throne, named Crown Prince Kalmāṣapāda. Because his feet were spotted, he was named Kalmāṣapāda (Spotted-foot). He received the teaching of the heretical teacher Raudra that he should take the heads of a thousand kings to sacrifice to the tomb deity Mahākāla and ascend to that throne to become a flying emperor. Wings grew on his body and he leaped through empty space, already capturing 999 kings. The thousand kings lacked one king in number. Traveling north ten thousand li, he obtained one king named King Puṇyaraśmi. That King Puṇyaraśmi addressed King Kalmāṣapāda saying: 'Please grant me one day's respite. In just one day I will return to my original country. A mendicant monk initially made an oral vow—if I do not make offerings and break the precept against false speech, I will certainly make offerings and return.' King Kalmāṣapāda granted one day's respite. At that time King Puṇyaraśmi immediately returned to his original country and, following the dharma of the past seven buddhas, invited one hundred dharma masters and set up one hundred high seats. In one day and two periods he finished lecturing on 8 billion verses of the Prajñā Sutra. The first dharma master spoke a verse for King Puṇyaraśmi saying: 'When the kalpa fire finishes burning, heaven and earth blaze throughout. Mount Sumeru and the vast oceans all become ash that rises up. The merit of heavenly dragons is exhausted, and they wither and perish therein. Even the two principles [heaven and earth] still

the beginningless dwelling place of sentient beings. The six consciousnesses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—giving rise to immeasurable desires is called "store emptiness." The eye seeing form-dust and arising various form-dust 《Marginal note: [Investigation] "dust" probably means "desire"》 samsara. The ear hearing sound-dust and arising various sound-desire samsara. The nose smelling fragrance-dust and arising various fragrance-desire samsara. The tongue tasting taste-dust and arising various taste-desire samsara. The body feeling touch-dust and arising various touch-desire samsara. The mind thinking of dharma-dust and arising various thought samsara. This is called the desire-realm store. Next, the form-realm store is being deluded by the form-dust of the upper realms and creating karma, receiving the karmic retribution of the tall, great bodies of 16,000 yojanas, etc. of the upper realms—this is called the form-realm store. Next, the formless-realm store has no realm of the five dusts—form, sound, fragrance, taste, touch. Because there are only mind-only sentient beings, being deluded by one's own mind, creating karma, and receiving mental karmic retribution. The Akaniṣṭha heaven of Udrambara sleeps in mental concentration for 80,000 great eons. After the 80,000 great eons of retribution are exhausted, it again follows the lower realms, enters the animal path, and sinks to the bottom of Avīci hell. How fearsome! However, our Benevolent Kings Sutra Contemplating Emptiness Chapter explains that the desire-realm store is empty, the form-realm store is empty, the formless store is empty, and the fundamental ignorance store of the three realms is also empty. The three realms are like a mind painted in empty space. A painter looks up at empty space and writes a painting of the three realms. Again seeing his own painted picture, he faces the hell painting with fear, tears, terror, and screams. He is truly a foolish painter. You should know that the sentient beings of the three realms, stained by the brush of false imagination, write paintings of the three realms and six paths in empty space. With the inexhaustible painting tools of false thoughts, they paint in various colors the painting of samsaric birth and death. In the painting, sometimes they see evil path paintings and cry out in fear, sometimes they see good paths and laugh with joy. The two paths of good and evil are both dwelling places of samsaric birth and death. The two thoughts of sorrow and joy are equally the dreams of birth-death's long night. Thus, if one does not distinguish dharma-nature empty space and does not paint the three realms' painting, and also does not see the evil dreams of birth-death's long night, then [all is well]. Therefore,

I expound the emptiness of the three-realm stores and proclaim the emptiness of the fundamental ignorance store of the three realms. The foundation of the three realms is ignorance. Ignorance means not illuminating empty space. Awakening and understanding empty space is dharma-nature illumination. Therefore, when this Benevolent Kings Sutra Contemplating Emptiness Chapter expounds the dharma-nature of three-realm empty space, immeasurable sentient beings attain the pure dharma-eye, permanently leave the three realms, and attain the awakening of great emptiness bodhisattvas. They awaken from the dream of birth-death's long night. 《Marginal note: Above》 Benevolent Kings prajñā practice is the secret dharma for quickly awakening from the dream of three-realm six-path samsaric birth and death. How precious!

The Matter of One Moment of Faith in the Contemplating Emptiness Chapter Surpassing Giving Seven Treasures to Beings of the Three Realms

The Benevolent Kings Sutra of the Contemplating Emptiness Chapter states: "Regarding dharma-nature empty space and three-realm store emptiness, giving seven treasures to immeasurable sentient beings throughout Ganges-sand three-thousand worlds, all attaining the seven stages of worthiness and four fruits, does not compare to arising one moment of faith within this sutra. How much more so for one who understands even one verse!" 《Marginal note: Above》 Thus, giving treasures of gold, silver, crystal, etc. to sentient beings of three-thousand worlds is conditioned good roots that increasingly create the karmic causes of samsara. Also, attaining the benefits of the seven stages of worthiness and four fruits are karmic causes of birth and death in the provisional land. Since the dharma-nature empty space of the Benevolent Kings Sutra Contemplating Emptiness Chapter shows that the fundamental ignorance of the three-realm stores is empty space, one permanently awakens from the dream of the three realms' birth-death by segments and brightly startles awake from the sleep of transformational birth-death. Up to cause-emptiness and Buddha-fruit emptiness, one awakens and becomes clear and bright, transcending the wondrous enlightenment Buddha. Awakening and achieving the tenth Vairocana (or Vairocana?) wisdom-ocean-store Buddha of the tenth ground above the Buddha-fruit that towers ten layers above the Tathāgatas of all teachings and schools—is this not the inconceivable benefit of the Benevolent Kings Sutra?

Chapter Three: Teaching and Transformation

To explain this chapter, there are three sections including the reason for its coming. First, the reason for its coming: The previous chapter explained Buddha-fruit emptiness. Namely, the ten-ground bodhisattvas practiced Buddha-cause emptiness and Buddha-fruit emptiness. Following the above Contemplating Emptiness Chapter, now the Teaching and Transformation Chapter comes.

Next, explaining the name: "Teaching and transformation" means teaching and transforming without teaching or transformation. It is like following the traces of a bird flying in empty space. Therefore it is named the Teaching and Transformation Chapter. Next, entering the text with doctrinal analysis: the World-Honored One teaches and transforms bodhisattvas. The five patiences are: nurturing the ten minds, twenty-two roots, fourteen patiences, ten no-dharma positions, and the three truths' manifest great wisdom-light.

Generally, the practice of protecting the ten grounds in the Benevolent Kings Sutra Teaching and Transformation Chapter is the five persons 《Marginal note: [Investigation] "persons" is probably "patiences"》. The sutra states: "The Buddha said: The practice of protecting the ten grounds is the five patiences. This is the bodhisattva dharma. Upper, middle, lower submission patience; upper, middle, lower faith patience; upper, middle, lower accordance patience; upper, middle, lower no-arising patience; upper, middle, lower extinction patience—this is called the bodhisattvas' cultivation of prajñāpāramitā." 《Marginal note: Above》 The proclamation of Śākyamuni's influence states: Thus expounding and proclaiming the five patiences of the Benevolent Kings Sutra Teaching and Transformation Chapter. You should know that the five patiences are the Buddha-path of prajñā practice. Upper, middle, lower submission patience, upper, middle, lower faith patience 《Marginal note: [Investigation] The five characters "upper, middle, lower faith patience" are probably superfluous》 are the three positions of dwelling, practice, and dedication. Upper, middle, lower faith patience are the first, second, third grounds. Upper, middle, lower accordance patience are the fourth, fifth, sixth grounds. Upper, middle, lower no-arising patience are upper, middle, lower 《Marginal note: [Investigation] upper》《Marginal note: The three characters "middle, lower" are probably superfluous》 seventh, eighth, ninth grounds. Upper, middle, lower extinction patience are upper, middle, lower 《Marginal note: [Investigation] The three characters "upper, middle, lower" are probably superfluous》 tenth ground and wondrous enlightenment. 《Marginal note: [Investigation] The correspondence of the five patiences to the fifty positions differs from the store commentary; there is probably a copying error in the text and should be further investigated》 Thus our Benevolent Kings Sutra expounds prajñāpāra-

mitā empty space. Empty space sees illusion and transformation. The three realms and six paths, and even all things, are illusion and transformation. The good and evil causes and effects of the three times are all illusion and transformation. From ten-dwelling bodhisattvas to the five eyes of all buddhas, all are like illusions. Bodhisattvas transform illusions and transformations 《Marginal note: indeed》. The good and evil causes and effects of the three times are all illusion and transformation. From ten-dwelling bodhisattvas to the five eyes of all buddhas, all are like illusions. Bodhisattvas transform illusions and transformations 《Marginal note: indeed》. 《Marginal note: [Investigation] The twenty-five characters from "three times" to "transform transformations" are duplicated text, probably a copying surplus》 The illusions and transformations of sentient beings are like this. 《Marginal note: Above》 Therefore the five patiences endure illusions. They endure transformations and endure empty space. The prajñā-practicing bodhisattvas of upper, middle, lower submission patience, in empty space ten-dwelling, empty space ten-practice, and empty space ten-dedication, submit 【(two dots?)】 to the illusions of empty space ignorance and delusion as one, and endure illusory ignorance. The prajñā-practicing bodhisattvas of upper, middle, lower faith patience, in the first ground of joy, second ground of freedom from desire, and third ground of light-emission 《Marginal note: [Investigation] Below "light" probably missing the character "ground"》, have faith in dharma-nature empty space and endure the illusions of ignorant false imagination. The prajñā-practicing bodhisattvas of upper, middle, lower accordance patience, in the fourth blazing wisdom ground, fifth extremely difficult to conquer ground, and sixth manifest ground, accord with dharma-nature empty space and endure the illusions of ignorance. The prajñā-practicing bodhisattvas of upper, middle, lower no-arising patience, in the seventh far-traveling ground, eighth immovable ground, and ninth good wisdom ground, [realize that] dharma-nature great emptiness has no arising, and endure the illusions of ignorance. Next, the prajñāpāramitā of extinction patience upper 《Marginal note: [Investigation] Missing "lower" below "upper"》《Marginal note: The character "middle" is the same in the store commentary; probably there should be the character "middle"》 lower, in equal enlightenment and wondrous enlightenment, awakens to empty space extinction. Equal enlightenment endures the illusions of fundamental ignorance not yet severed. Wondrous enlightenment endures the illusions of fundamental ignorance already severed. This is called the five patiences of Benevolent Kings Sutra prajñā practice. The four applications of mindfulness within these five patiences are the four foundations of mindfulness: body, feelings, mind, dharmas. Stopping the mind four times. The Benevolent Kings Sutra states: The four applications of mindfulness are body, feelings, mind, dharmas—impurity, suffering, impermanence, no-self. This means contemplating bodily impurity to cure the delusion of purity, contemplating the suffering of feelings to cure the [delusion of] pleasure

Sutra: Great King, in the future there shall be those who are not of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha

Sutra: Great King, in the future the destruction will not be long

New commentary: Great King, in future ages, all kings and disciples of the four assemblies should rely on the path constantly practiced by all Buddhas of the ten directions to establish and circulate [the teaching].

Secret Dharma of the Benevolent Kings Sutra Influenced by Śākyamuni, Volume One

In lecturing on this sutra, we open three gateway approaches: general meaning, title explanation, and textual entry. First, regarding the general meaning: Prajñā is the awakening-mother of all Buddhas of the three times and the eye-feet of bodhisattvas practicing in the ten directions. Thus the teaching-master Śākyamuni once sought prajñā, going deep into the southern hermitage realms, and during a thousand years transmitted the lamp of prajñā to illuminate the darkness of the long night of birth and death of all sentient beings. The bodhisattva Sadāprarudita anciently sought prajñā eastward, dwelling far in the fragrant city, and from two thousand li away drew the water of prajñā to extinguish the blazing flames of afflictions of all classes of beings in the dharma-realm. Based on this, in Śākyamuni's fifty-year teaching career, he expounded the Prajñāpāramitā sutras for thirty years. The five-period prajñā teachings in eight sections, four locations, and sixteen assemblies were expounded year after year. The clouds of substantial prajñā covered high above the ninety-nine-story jeweled palace roofs of the sixth-heaven demon king; the mists of contemplative prajñā spread far over the tile-emptiness of the One True Victory Hall at Vulture Peak's Seven-Leaf Cave in Rājagṛha; the flowers of textual prajñā bloomed brilliantly beyond the treetops of Jetavana in Anāthapiṇḍada's garden in eastern India; the dew of retinue prajñā sprinkled white on the rippling waves of White Heron Pond in the bamboo grove of Rājagṛha in central India. Generally, the Great Prajñā of four locations and sixteen assemblies, scroll by scroll like a hundred rivers returning to harbor—the multitudinous streams of the complete Great Prajñā in 600 volumes, 275 chapters, 200,000 verses, and 6,440,000 characters—all enter into the concluding sutra of the Benevolent Kings Prajñā. Being of the same dharma-flavor, lecturing on the two volumes of the Benevolent Kings Sutra corresponds to reading the complete 600-volume Great Prajñā. How marvelous! How precious!

Next, explaining the title: "Buddha-spoken Benevolent Kings... First" means: "Buddha-spoken" refers to what Śākyamunibuddha spoke. "Benevolent Kings Protecting the Nation" protects human lands, hence named "Benevolent Kings Protecting the Nation." The character "benevolent" (jin 仁) is constructed from "person" (hito), with the upper horizontal stroke representing heaven and the lower horizontal stroke representing earth. This realm penetrates the three powers of heaven, earth, and humanity. The heavenly spirits receive protection, the earth spirits receive submission, and humanity receives veneration, hence named "benevolent," named "king," titled "Benevolent King." "Protecting the Nation" means: in the sixteen great countries, five hundred middle countries, ten thousand small countries, and immeasurable scattered kingdoms, sweeping away endless difficulties and inviting boundless fortune and blessings, guarding kings, protecting ministers and people, enriching the land, and nurturing beings—this is the prajñā sutra, hence named "Nation-Protecting Prajñā Sutra." Next, "prajñāpāramitā": prajñā translates as wisdom 《Marginal note: [Investigation] Below "wisdom" the five characters "pāramitā translates as" are probably missing》 reaching the other shore. Prajñā empty-wisdom reaches the other shore of bodhi-nirvana, hence named prajñāpāramitā. Next, "sutra" is the general name for sacred teachings. "Prologue" means explaining sequence and origin. "Chapter" means categories of the same meaning. "First" means the beginning of the eight chapters of one complete work, hence 《Marginal note: [Investigation] Below "hence" the word "named" is probably missing》 "Prologue Chapter First." Next, regarding textual analysis: the beginning Prologue Chapter is the introductory section; the next five chapters—Contemplating Emptiness, Teaching and Transformation, Two Truths, Protecting the Nation, and Scattering Flowers—are the main doctrine; the final two chapters—Maintaining and Entrustment—are the circulation section.

Prologue Chapter
"Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha dwelt in Rājagṛha on Vulture Peak" means: When Venerable Ānanda was compiling [the teachings], he ascended the lion throne and proclaimed: "Thus did I, Ānanda, as attendant to Śākyamuni, hear the Benevolent Kings Sutra. From the eighth day of the first month of the initial year, at one time Śākyamuni dwelt on Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha of Magadha, surrounded by great assemblies of cloud-seas from this 《Marginal note: [Investigation] 'sea' is probably 'realm'》 and other realms, and expounded the complete Benevolent Kings Sutra in eight chapters."

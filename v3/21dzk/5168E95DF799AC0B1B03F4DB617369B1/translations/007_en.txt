encompasses all dharmas with the three truths. Because of the truth of emptiness, the truth of form, and the truth of mind. I explain that all dharmas do not go beyond the three truths." 《Marginal note: Above》 Thus, the conventional and ultimate two truths of the Two Truths Chapter of the Benevolent Kings Sutra are the great matter of the past seven buddhas. All sentient beings have been flowing and turning in birth and death since beginningless time, not awakening to ultimate truth and not knowing conventional truth because of dream illusions. Since ancient times, though there have been many dragon-elephants among the teachers—three in the south and seven in the north—regarding the Two Truths Chapter of the Benevolent Kings Sutra, they have not yet attained the Buddha's intention. At Stone-Top Flower Peak of Mount Tiantai, on the night of the 25th day of the ninth month of autumn in the seventh year of Dajian of the Chen dynasty, after Zen Master Zhiyi of Tiantai subdued the Sixth Heaven Demon King, the morning star gradually appeared. Its length was sixteen feet, wearing golden light on its crown. A divine monk appeared as an influence in empty space, and looking vaguely, it was the teaching master Śākyamuni. With the voice of great brahma blessing, he proclaimed: "You have now subdued the Sixth Heaven Demon King. Since I, Śākyamuni Buddha, subdued the demon king upon attaining enlightenment in the past, there has been no one who has subdued the heavenly demon Pāpīyān. You should now be courageous." After praising, he immediately explained the conventional and ultimate two truths of the Benevolent Kings. That influence of Śākyamuni explained: "The great matter of the past seven buddhas' appearance in the world is the conventional and ultimate two truths. Why? Because in conventional truth there is the Sixth Heaven Demon King, but in ultimate truth there is no Sixth Heaven Demon King. Also, in conventional truth there is flowing and turning in birth and death. Thus conventional truth is dream, and ultimate truth is awakening. In dreams one sees various meaningless things, but when the dream awakens, it is empty. Flowing and turning in birth and death are all dreams of false imagination. The Sixth Heaven Demon King is also a dream of false imagination. When the dream of false imagination awakens, there are no troubles of flowing and turning in birth and death, and no fear of the demon king Pāpīyān. However, sentient beings cling to dreams and imagine dreams, not knowing the awakening of ultimate truth. Many are deceived by demon kings, disturbed by greed and pitiable. Such sentient beings are all deceived by the illusory demons of conventional truth. You have now awakened to the dharma-nature of ultimate truth and

have again subdued the heavenly demons. Therefore I praise you." 《Marginal note: [Investigation] There are probably missing characters after "praise"》 Constantly abiding in the indestructible palace of Vulture Peak, I cast my influence from afar. 《Marginal note: And so forth》 At that time Zhiyi addressed him saying: "In conventional truth there are heavenly demons; in ultimate truth there are dreams of heavenly demons. Also, in conventional truth there is flowing and turning in birth and death; in ultimate truth there is no flowing and turning in birth and death." He earnestly expounded for sentient beings. Śākyamuni said: "Excellent, excellent! Listen carefully, listen carefully! The great matter of the past seven buddhas' appearance in the world is the two truths. I explain the two truths in the Two Truths Chapter of my Benevolent Kings Sutra for King Prasenajit Moonlight. Listen carefully, listen carefully, think well upon it. I truly explain the verse of the seven buddhas. Presenting the essential point, I explain conventional truth as dream and ultimate truth as dream-awakening. Moreover, sentient beings in dreams do not know the matter of awakening. Therefore they see dreams. In the distant past, I as Śākyamuni Bodhisattva and Mañjuśrī debated the two truths and both fell into the Black Rope Hell. Ordinary beings like scattered millet debated twenty-two doubts about the two truths, but none understood the Buddha's intention and all turned in birth and death. Thus, repeatedly questioning oneself and repeatedly answering oneself, exhausting the source and completing the nature, I cause all sentient beings to understand the two truths and awaken from the dream of the long night of birth and death. Self-questioning: Are there conventional truths? Self-answering: In the verse of the seven buddhas that I explained, it says: 'Conventional truths arise from illusory transformations, like flowers in empty space. Illusory transformations see illusory transformations. Sentient beings are called illusory magicians. Illusory magicians see illusory dharmas. In reality they are all non-existent. This is called the contemplation of all buddhas.'" 《Marginal note: Above》 Thus conventional truth is dream-illusion, conventional truth is empty flowers, conventional truth is truly nothing. This is the verse of the Two Truths Chapter explained in the Benevolent Kings Sutra. Asking again: "If so, are the dream-illusions of conventional truth and the flowing and turning in birth and death all dreams?" Answer: "Yes. Flowing and turning in birth and death are dream-illusions." Asking again: "If so, there are sentient beings born in the morning and sentient beings who die in the evening—are they all dream-illusions?" Answer: "Yes. Sentient beings born in the morning are dreams, and sentient beings who die in the evening are also dreams." Asking again: "There really are sentient beings who are born and there really are sentient beings who die—why do you explain them as dream-illusions?" Answer: "Throughout vast kalpas

and many births, how many births have you received? How many deaths have you received? The sands of the Ganges are no comparison, and particles of dust are no analogy. Yet the forms of births throughout vast kalpas have been crushed to fine dust and scattered in empty space. The corpses of many births and deaths have been crushed to fine dust and scattered in empty space. Now searching through the three times, there are no births from vast kalpas; seeking throughout the ten directions, there cannot be the many births and deaths. Because they cannot exist, the births and deaths of vast kalpas and many births all become dreams." Asking again: "If the birth of the present world is real birth, not dream, and the death of this life is real death, not dream, why do you explain present birth and death as dreams?" Answer: "The birth of this life also begins when two drops drip into empty space from the beginning of the embryonic stage (kalala), and the spirit dwells in those two drops as the beginning of receiving birth. Empty space has no birth, the two drops have no birth, the spirit has no permanent home and no birth. Therefore, the birth of this life also encircles empty space to become 'already born'—it is the empty birth of empty space. If it is the empty birth of empty space, then the birth of this life is also dream-illusion. Also, the death of this life, being death, is crushed to fine dust and scattered in empty space, so it is dream-illusion." Asking again: "If so, are the future eternal cycles of birth and death all completely non-existent?" Answer: "Yes. The future eternal cycles of birth and death are all completely dream-illusions." Asking again: "If so, why do the buddhas explain that one should fear future eternal cycles of birth and death?" Answer: "Sentient beings in the long night of birth and death see nightmare dreams of false imagination and become fearful. The buddhas take pity on this and teach them, startling them not to see the nightmares of future eternal cycles." Asking again: "If so, the future eternal sequential birth-death sequential subsequent karma, the fixed karma of hundreds of thousands of births up to immeasurable kalpas that does not decay, bringing about the karmic results of future endless birth and death—the buddhas of the three times definitively explain this. Why do you explain future eternal cycles of birth and death as dream-illusions?" Answer: "Even fixed karma, in the Mahāyāna of ultimate emptiness, is fixed in empty space. In my former Samantabhadra Contemplation Sutra, it explains: 'My mind is naturally empty. Sin and merit have no master. All seas of karmic obstacles arise from false imagination. If one wishes to repent, sit upright and contemplate true

characteristics.'" Thus fixed karma has no master. Without a master there is no birth. Before the wind of birthless repentance, even the deluding clouds of fixed karma all scatter and cannot be grasped." Asking again: "If so, earnestly explain again for future sentient beings that future eternal cycles of birth and death are all completely dream-illusions." Answer: "Future eternal cycles of birth and death also, searching from now, have no east, west, south, or north. Also no four intermediate directions, above, or below. They exist only in the dream-imagination of sentient beings. All sentient beings, in false imagination, dream-imagine all sentient beings as dream-illusions." Asking again: "If the three realms and six paths of conventional truth are all completely non-illusory, are the sword mountains and blade trees of the hell realm dreams? Are the boiling cauldrons and fierce fires illusions? If the hell realm is dream-illusion and non-existent, why does the World-Honored One explain in various sutras that one should fear hell?" Answer: "Throughout vast kalpas and many births, how many times have you fallen into hell? Yet the sword mountains of the fearful screaming hells of vast kalpas were crushed during past destruction kalpas, becoming fine dust scattered in empty space. Also, the boiling cauldrons and fierce smoke of hell were crushed during past destruction kalpas, becoming fine dust scattered in empty space. The sword mountains and blade trees of hell realms throughout vast kalpas and many births are all dreams. Also, the boiling cauldrons and fierce smoke of hell realms are all illusions." Asking again: "If the cycles of birth and death in conventional truth are all completely dream-illusions, are the cycles of birth and death in the hungry ghost realm of famine cities dreams?" Answer: "Yes. Throughout vast kalpas and many births, how many times have you fallen into the hungry ghost realm? How many times have you fallen into the animal realm where beings devour each other? How many times have you fallen into the asura realm of battles and conflicts? How many times have you cycled through the human realm of eight sufferings? How many times have you cycled through the heaven realm of five declines? The Benevolent Kings Sutra explains that the three realms are all completely dream-illusions. Throughout vast kalpas and many births there has been receiving and abandoning; the corpses of the six paths and the forms of the four births all decay, becoming fine dust moments 《Marginal note: [Investigation] "moments" is probably "lands"》 and returning to empty space, all becoming dream-emptiness." Asking again: "If so, if conventional truth is all completely dream-illusion, is the four noble truths contemplation of śrāvakas also dream-illusion? Also, is causation-

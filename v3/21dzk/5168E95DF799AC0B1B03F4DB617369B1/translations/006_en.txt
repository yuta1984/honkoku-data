blow the pāramitā dharma conch. They awaken from the sleep of beginningless ignorance and startle beings to the enlightenment of the wisdom-ocean palace of Vairocana, the wondrous enlightenment Buddha of Benevolent Kings prajñā. Next, eighth ground bodhisattvas of Benevolent Kings prajñā practice become the Light-Bright Great Brahmā Kings of the third dhyāna of the upper realm. They manifest dual-illumination skillful means dhyāna penetration, painting pictures in empty space with middle way dual illumination. With unobstructed supernatural wisdom they guide all sentient beings and send them to the wisdom-ocean palace of Vairocana above the wondrous enlightenment of Benevolent Kings prajñā. Next, ninth ground bodhisattvas of Benevolent Kings prajñā practice become Great Brahmā Kings of the third dhyāna of the upper realm. With the four unobstructed wisdoms of eloquent speech, they transform universally above the heavenly clouds, guiding all sentient beings and sending them to the Vairocana Tathāgata palace above the wondrous enlightenment of Benevolent Kings prajñā. Next, tenth ground bodhisattvas of Benevolent Kings prajñā practice become the Great Tranquility Heaven Kings with three eyes and eight arms—Vairocana Maheśvara Heaven of the fourth dhyāna of the upper realm. Becoming the life-spirit deities and ancestral teachers of all sentient beings, they personally proclaim the samādhi of principle's exhaustion, guiding all sentient beings and sending them to the inner-realization original palace above the wondrous enlightenment Buddha of the ultimate principle and source nature of Vairocana Tathāgata in Benevolent Kings prajñā. The protective deities of Benevolent Kings prajñā are the Four Great Heavenly Kings, Śakra, the Sixth Heaven Demon King, the Great Brahmā Heaven King lord of the three thousand worlds, and the three-eyed eight-armed Maheśvara Heaven at the summit of the form realm. Rising high in ten layers of upper and lower realms, they protect the countries of believers in the Benevolent Kings Prajñā Sutra. The efficacious benefits of protecting the nation and benefiting the people are because all the heavenly deities of the upper and lower realms, with Benevolent Kings prajñā being supremely excellent for one lifetime, are entirely protected by heavenly kings practicing Benevolent Kings prajñā. This is because of the inner-realization secret dharma of the Benevolent Kings. The oral instruction states: This is the secret dharma of the protective deities of the Benevolent Kings.

The matter of the secret dharma of the original first thought and final vajra thought of the Benevolent Kings Sutra

The Teaching and Transformation Chapter states: "The first thought-consciousness of sentient beings' consciousness differs from wood and stone. There are innately good and innately evil qualities. Evil

becomes the basis of countless evil consciousnesses, and good becomes the basis of countless good consciousnesses. Between the initial first thought vajra and the final thought, ineffable and ineffable consciousnesses arise, becoming sentient beings and creating sentient beings. Illusory transformations 《Marginal note: [Investigation] The five characters "becoming sentient beings illusory transformations" should probably be the four characters "form and mind, and so forth"》 The six paths are illusory transformations. Illusory transformations see illusory transformations." 《Marginal note: Above》 Regarding the Teaching and Transformation Chapter of the Benevolent Kings Sutra stating that the first thought-consciousness of sentient beings differs from wood and stone, various schools since ancient times have raised doubts. If beginningless ignorance is beginningless, why establish an initial first thought of delusion? 《Marginal note: And so forth》 Śākyamuni's influence proclaims: "In the Great Perfect Enlightenment Sutra 《Marginal note: Within five thousand volumes》 Practice and Meaning Sutra that I explained, it states that beginningless illusory transformation ignorance is established above the Tathāgata's great perfect enlightenment. Original enlightenment is like gold ore. Within the ore there is gold. Within the ore of ignorance there is the golden nature of original enlightenment. This means that within the ore of all sentient beings' beginningless ignorance there is the golden nature of original enlightenment. Therefore it is called original enlightenment Tathāgata. Because it is called original enlightenment Tathāgata, establishing that original enlightenment emerges from the first thought of falsity is a skillful means to guide deluded sentient beings to return to the palace of original enlightenment. Original enlightenment is empty space; ignorance is the illusion of empty space. There is nothing to deceive. If you trust that empty space originally has no illusions of ignorance, then there is no arising of the first thought, no first thought, no vajra sutra 《Marginal note: [Investigation] "sutra" is probably "final"》 thought, no false thought, no sentient beings. Sentient beings are illusions and the three realms are illusions. When illusory sentient beings see illusory dharmas and think they receive illusory birth and death, this is due to the cataracts of false imagination. If all sentient beings do not remember illusory thoughts and do not arise them, they can immediately return to original enlightenment empty space." 《Marginal note: Above》 Thus, beginningless ignorance illusions and beginningless birth and death—knowing them as illusions and returning to empty space, one never again arises thoughts. Like in the Wonderful Dharma Sutra, the dragon daughter deeply realized that sin and merit have no master. Masterless empty space Buddha-nature—empty space Buddha-nature is the dharma-body, the dharma-body is Vairocana Tathāgata, so beginningless illusory ignorance is never permanently broken. Realizing and awakening to the universally pervading dharma-realm, the one great empty space Vairocana, throughout the endless future one does not arise illusory false thoughts and should return to the tenth ground Vairocana wisdom-ocean enlightenment palace above the original source wondrous

enlightenment of Benevolent Kings prajñā. This is Śākyamuni's influence Benevolent Kings secret dharma.

The matter that the addressee assembly of the Benevolent Kings Sutra is King Prasenajit, Prasenajit being King Moonlight, a great expedient manifestation

The Teaching and Transformation Chapter states: "The Buddha told King Moonlight: 'In the past, during the time of Dragon Light King Buddha ten thousand kalpas ago, you were an entering and abiding bodhisattva. Now before me you give a great lion's roar.'" 《Marginal note: And so forth》 Thus the Benevolent Kings Prajñā Sutra has King Prasenajit (King Moonlight), lord of Śrāvastī in Eastern Jambudvīpa, as the originating assembly 《Marginal note: [Investigation] Below "assembly" probably missing the character "and"》 and addressee assembly. King Moonlight is an entering stage 《Marginal note: [Investigation] "stage" should probably be the character "abiding"》 bodhisattva. An entering stage 《Marginal note: [Investigation] "stage" should probably be "abiding"》 bodhisattva is a deep-stage bodhisattva. He is the father of Queen Śrīmālā, a great expedient manifestation of Avalokiteśvara for saving the world. Śākyamuni's influence 《Marginal note: And so forth》

Śākyamuni's Influence Benevolent Kings Sutra Secret Dharma Volume Three - Completed

Śākyamuni's Influence Benevolent Kings Sutra Secret Dharma Volume Four
Two Truths Chapter

In interpreting this chapter there are three sections. First, regarding the reason for coming: the above Teaching and Transformation Chapter taught and protected Buddha-fruit practice and transformed and protected ten-ground practice. Now comes conventional and ultimate two truths. Therefore, following the above Teaching and Transformation Chapter, the two truths come below. Next, interpreting the chapter name: ultimate truth is the principle of real truth; conventional truth is the principle of worldly truth. "Truth" means the meaning of clarity. Clear and bright like the sun, blind people cannot see it. Because the World-Honored One names it "truth," it is called the Two Truths Chapter. Next, entering the text for analytical interpretation: First, King Prasenajit questions the Buddha about the two truths. Second, the teaching master Śākyamuni answers about the two

【Left page, lower section】
truths. Third, the Buddha explains illuminating the two truths within the ultimate meaning. Fourth, King Prasenajit again addresses the Buddha saying: "How do buddhas and bodhisattvas practice the characteristics of all dharmas without departing from letters?" Fifth, the World-Honored One proclaims that suchness letters are the mother of all buddhas' wisdom. Sixth, he shows the three truths dharma-realm as the path of buddhas' intrinsic pure nature. Seventh, he declares that the prajñā sutras explained by the seven buddhas have become the present Benevolent Kings Sutra. Eighth, he explains that the immeasurable inconceivable merits of liberation from upholding, reading, and reciting the Benevolent Kings Sutra. Ninth, the Benevolent Kings Prajñā Sutra's protection of countries and lands is like city walls and swords.

The secret matter of constantly illuminating the two truths within the ultimate meaning

The Two Truths Chapter of the Benevolent Kings Sutra 《Marginal note: [Investigation] Below "chapter" probably missing the character "states"》: "The Buddha told the great king: 'You have already asked about one meaning and two meanings before the seven buddhas of the past. I now explain the verse of the seven buddhas: Dharma-nature is originally without nature, ultimate meaning emptiness and suchness. Existence and non-existence are originally two, like the two horns of an ox. With illuminating understanding seeing no-two, the two truths are constantly not identical. With understanding mind seeing not-two, seeking two cannot be obtained. In understanding it is constantly one by itself; in truth it is constantly two by itself. Penetrating and reaching this no-two, one truly enters the ultimate meaning. Worldly truths arise as illusory transformations, like flowers in empty space. Illusory transformations see illusions 《Marginal note: [Investigation] Below "see" probably missing the two characters "illusion seeing"》, magicians see magical dharmas. In reality they are all non-existent. This is called the contemplation of all buddhas. The contemplation of bodhisattvas is also thus. Great king, bodhisattvas within the ultimate meaning constantly illuminate the two truths. Because bodhisattvas are empty, the two truths are empty space. When bodhisattvas have not yet become buddhas, they take bodhisattvas as afflictions. When bodhisattvas become buddhas, they take afflictions as bodhi. Why? Because in the ultimate meaning they are not two. Because all buddhas and tathāgatas, and even all dharmas, are suchness. Great king, existence and non-existence are worldly truth.'"

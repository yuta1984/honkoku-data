the wondrous characteristics. Therefore it is still called the shallow teaching.

The later perfect teaching (Engyō): This teaching clarifies the non-obstruction between phenomena and phenomena, exhaustively investigates the essence and characteristics of all dharmas, discusses the inexhaustible relationship of principal and auxiliary [dharmas], and manifests the perfect completeness of fruition characteristics. Therefore, the ten mysterious dependent originations interpenetrate all dharmas through immediate entry, and the six characteristics' perfect interfusion pervade all characteristics without obstruction. One is immediately many without separation, many is immediately one with perfect penetration. It gathers the nine periods of time into a single moment, extends one thought to encompass eternal eons. Realization of fruition in three lifetimes manifests original accomplishment in return; when the path of the ten faiths is perfected, it merges with the ocean of fruition. The establishment of sequential progression spans many eons, yet the wondrous meaning of perfect interfusion realizes fruition in the present body. Sequential progression does not obstruct perfect interfusion; perfect interfusion does not hinder sequential progression. Therefore one attains the mutual identity and interfusion of all characteristics. This is the meaning of this teaching. The lifetime of teachings expounded by the Tathāgata, though distinguished by shallow and deep, does not go beyond these five. It truly judges all dharmas without omission and encompasses all dharma-gates without remainder.

Among these five, the first is Hīnayāna, the last is the One Vehicle, and the middle three are all Three Vehicle teachings. The initial and final teachings are gradual; combined they form the two teachings of gradual and sudden. Within the gradual, initial and final are distinguished, thus becoming three.

These five are collectively bundled as one great skillful means, and as a vast dharma-network, the perfect teaching is complete in its encompassing divisions. Because it exhaustively encompasses within the four dharma-realms. Generally speaking, this is the most excellent of the lifetime teachings, and no other school's profound depths compare to this perfect teaching. Only this teaching reaches the ultimate. Avataṃsaka is like Mount Sumeru; other teachings resemble surrounding mountains. All teachings converge in the great ocean of Avataṃsaka; the three vehicles all emerge from the vast garden of this sūtra. Therefore this teaching is called the fundamental dharma-wheel, the perfectly ultimate and sovereign teaching.

Next, regarding the ten schools: The above five teachings, when divided according to schools, do not exceed ten schools. First is the school where both self and dharmas exist, second is the school where dharmas exist but self does not, third is the

school where dharmas have no past and future, fourth is the school where present [dharmas] pervade provisional and real, fifth is the school where conventional is false and true is real, sixth is the school where all dharmas are merely names.

The above schools are all opened within Hīnayāna teaching. Seventh is the school where all is empty, eighth is the school where true virtues are not empty—this is the final teaching. Ninth is the school where characteristics and thoughts are both transcended—this is the sudden teaching. Tenth is the school of perfect illumination and complete virtues—this is the perfect teaching.

Question: What is the character of the practices and stages of the five teachings?

Answer: Within Hīnayāna teaching, the divisions of practices and stages are entirely the same as the Abhidharma treatises. Mahāyāna initial teaching also clarifies the stages of the two vehicles. For the bodhisattva vehicle, it establishes fifty-one stages, making the ten faiths established stages. This is based on those of direct-advancing capacity. Or it establishes the ten grounds common to the three vehicles, etc.—this is based on those of turning-mind capacity. In the final teaching, all sentient beings achieve Buddhahood, establishing forty-one stages, because the ten faiths are not made into stages. The one stage of near-enlightenment has differences of division and combination. The sudden teaching involves complete extinction without dependence—originally no stages are established. The perfect teaching has two aspects: first, the common-teaching One Vehicle, entirely the same as the final teaching; second, the distinct-teaching One Vehicle, entirely distinct from the three vehicles because it is not the same as them. This has two gates: first, the gate of sequential progressive arrangement, because cause and effect are progressively cultivated and realized through sequential entry; second, the gate of perfect interfusion and mutual inclusion, because cause and effect are interfused and included without obstruction through immediate entry. Through sequential progression, one passes through indescribably indescribable dust-mote numbers of eons; through perfect interfusion, one swiftly realizes Buddha-fruition in a single thought. This teaching establishes becoming Buddha in three lifetimes: seeing and hearing, understanding and practice, realization and entry. The principles and meanings of the perfect teaching encompass everything within the four dharma-realms without remainder. First is the dharma-realm of phenomena, second is the dharma-realm of principle, third is the dharma-realm of non-obstruction between phenomena and principle, fourth is the dharma-realm of non-obstruction between phenomena and phenomena.

Question: How many types does this school establish for the Buddha's body and land?

Answer: The five teachings differ. In the perfect teaching, three types of lands are established, all being Garbha-

adorned worlds. Pure and impure are interfused, one and many without obstruction. Buddha has ten bodies: sentient being body, land body, karmic retribution body, śrāvaka body, etc. Among all dharmas, none is not Buddha-essence. Because of the adornment of myriad virtues and limitless encompassing inclusion. Speaking of elimination, one elimination is all eliminations; speaking of realization, one accomplishment is all accomplishments. The ten bodies are complete; Vairocana initially manifested and opened the inexhaustible mysterious teaching. All dharmas are exhausted within this. For beings of shallow and near capacity, [the teaching] gradually branches and flows until the Lotus Sūtra gathers the three into one, finally causing awakening and entry into the Avataṃsaka One Vehicle. The transformative ritual of one lifetime only unfolds this sūtra; ultimate encompassing return only enters this sūtra. When unfolded, the eighty thousand [teachings] of one lifetime are luxuriant and intertwined; when gathered, the wondrous expositions of nine assemblies are profound, vast, and all-encompassing. The Great Vaipulya Buddha Avataṃsaka Sūtra represents the mysterious union of principle and wisdom, already manifest in the title. The sea-assembly of Avataṃsaka where the youth Sudhana realized entry in one lifetime is truly clarified in the final assembly. If one desires to obtain swift great fruition, nothing surpasses this sūtra. The teaching and principles are extremely profound—what school can match this? The ten mysterious dependent originations bloom fresh as flowers; the six characteristics' perfect interfusion shines bright as the moon. Chief among all sūtras, honored master of all schools—vast and boundless, limitless and free, indescribable—only this sūtra-school.

Shingon School

Question: Why is it called the Shingon School?

Answer: Because it takes the esoteric mantra sūtras such as the Mahāvairocana Sūtra and Susiddhikara Sūtra as its foundation, it is called thus.

Question: Who transmitted and propagated this school?

Answer: Seven hundred years after the Tathāgata's extinction, Bodhisattva Nāgārjuna opened the iron tower of Southern India, encountered Vajrasattva, received abhiṣeka empowerment, and thereafter widely transmitted it. Vajrasattva directly

received [the teaching] from Mahāvairocana Tathāgata. Mahāvairocana Tathāgata is the teaching-master. Bodhisattva Nāgārjuna transmitted it to Bodhisattva Nāgabodhi. From then on, Tripiṭaka Master Śubhakarasiṃha, Tripiṭaka Master Vajrabodhi, Dhyāna Master Yixing, Tripiṭaka Master Amoghavajra, and Master Huiguo each successively continued the lineage with dharma-transmission bloodline flowing on. Regarding the transmission to Japan: Great Master Kōbō crossed the ocean waves, met Ācārya Huiguo, extensively received this school's transmission, then returned to Japan and greatly established this school. From then until now, throughout Japan, from the capital to the countryside, none do not study and receive [this teaching], continuing unbroken to this day. Generally, this teaching's flourishing in Japan is entirely due to Great Master Kōbō's power. The Great Master was a great empowered manifestation-trace, with supreme virtue beyond comparison and practice-karma without equal. He mastered all exoteric and esoteric schools without omission, thoroughly mastering the great, small, and complete Tripiṭaka collections. In dharma-transmission spiritual communication, awesome verification, talent and artistry, how could there be anyone matching the Great Master? He was truly a bright lamp illuminating a thousand ages, sun and moon shining on future generations. Finally entering samādhi at Mount Kōya, honored by humans and devas, revered by the eight classes of beings. His inner realization and external function are inconceivable.

Question: How many teachings does this school establish?

Answer: It establishes the ten mind-stages (jūjūshin), encompassing all great, small, exoteric, and esoteric teachings, exhaustively without remainder.

Question: What are these ten mind-stages?

Answer: First is the mind of the different-birth goat, second is the mind of the foolish child holding precepts, third is the mind of the infant without fear, fourth is the mind of only-aggregates no-self, fifth is the mind of extracting karmic causal seeds, sixth is the mind of other-dependent Mahāyāna, seventh is the mind of enlightened mind non-arising, eighth is the mind of one-path non-action, ninth is the mind of extreme no-self-nature, tenth is the mind of secret adornment. These are called the ten mind-stages. The first three mind-stages are worldly vehicles: within them, the first is the three evil paths, the second is the human vehicle, the third is the heavenly vehicle. The latter seven mind-stages are supramundane

categories. First: eight pārājika; second: seventeen saṃghāvaśeṣa; third: thirty niḥsargika-pāyattika; fourth: 178 simple pāyattika; fifth: eight pratideśanīya; sixth: one hundred śaikṣa for nuns. There are no two indeterminates. Regarding the seven adhikaraṇa-śamatha, there has been ancient debate about whether they should exist or not. Now, according to Vinaya Master Nanshan's doctrine, they must exist. Because the original Vinaya text is abbreviated, there should be seven categories, so the seven śamatha are added. In total there are 348 precepts. These also do not exceed the five categories. This can be understood by analogy with bhikṣu precepts. This constitutes the two-part extensive Vinaya. The scope of the dharma gates explained in the first half of the original Vinaya is thus. These are restraint-maintenance precepts.

Next is the performance-maintenance gate. The khandhaka dharmas are the twenty khandhakas of the latter half of the original Vinaya: 1) ordination khandhaka, 2) recitation khandhaka, 3) rains retreat khandhaka, 4) invitation khandhaka, 5) leather goods khandhaka, 6) robes khandhaka, 7) medicine khandhaka, 8) kaṭhina robe khandhaka, 9) Kauśāmbī khandhaka, 10) Campā khandhaka, 11) reproach khandhaka, 12) persons khandhaka, 13) concealment khandhaka, 14) obstruction khandhaka, 15) schism khandhaka, 16) settling disputes khandhaka, 17) nuns khandhaka, 18) dharma khandhaka, 19) dwellings khandhaka, 20) miscellaneous khandhaka. These are called the twenty khandhakas. All of these are performance-maintenance precepts. However, the two sections of the original Vinaya are not without mutual interpenetration. Restraint-maintenance has performance aspects, and performance has restraint aspects. Though there is mutual interpenetration, judging according to the majority, the front and back sections are distributed to the two maintenances.

If we compare to the five great sections: the Xingshi Chao and the two commentaries on precepts and karma are called the three great sections. The Precept Commentary clarifies the behavioral aspects of restraint-maintenance, detailing matters of prevention and adherent maintenance. The Karma Commentary clarifies the cultivation practice of performance-maintenance, making clear the principles of karmavācanā and saṃgha gathering. The Xingshi Chao clarifies both restraint and performance, with the three practices of assembly (four or more people), individual (one person), and together (two or three people), making the two maintenances complete.

The Nun Commentary, one section, separately clarifies the two maintenances for nuns. The Meaning Commentary, one section, mostly explains restraint-maintenance. Therefore the patriarch's various texts are only in these two maintenances. These two maintenance precepts have both general and specific aspects. Generally speaking, all various good actions are encompassed by the two maintenances. Specifically speaking, this is clarified only regarding the single school of Vinaya precepts. The present two maintenances are discussed specifically regarding the single gate of Vinaya precepts. If speaking about the general gate, this meaning is not absent.

Question: Are the complete precepts of monks and nuns limited to these?

Answer: Not so. The complete precepts of monks and nuns are limitless and boundless. If we determine numerical limits, it is only temporarily established according to conditions. The quantity of monastic precepts for both monks and nuns has three levels each. For monastic precepts, the three are: extensively limitless, moderately 3,000 deportments and 60,000 細行, briefly 250. For nun precepts having three levels: extensively limitless, moderately 80,000 deportments and 120,000 detailed practices, briefly 340 precepts. The sūtra speaks of 500 precepts—this has name but no characteristics. Great Wisdom Vinaya Master said: "Speaking in relation to circumstances, precepts are indeed limitless. We merely list 250 as the framework for maintenance and violation." Nun precepts are also thus. Therefore when the two assemblies of monks and nuns receive complete precepts, they all obtain such limitless and boundless precepts. Their quantity equals empty space, their scope pervades the dharma realm, with nothing incomplete. Therefore they are called complete precepts. The five precepts, eight precepts, ten precepts, six dharmas, etc., are all extracted from within the complete precepts, gradually guiding spiritual capacities as expedient means for complete precepts. Gradually advancing step by step, they finally achieve the complete position without vows. Therefore, generally speaking, precepts have four levels: five precepts, eight precepts, ten precepts, and complete precepts. If we add the six dharmas, there can be five categories in total. These establish the seven assemblies of the Buddha-Dharma. The seven assemblies are: 1) bhikṣu, 2) bhikṣuṇī—these two assemblies both have complete precepts; 3) śik-

ṣamāṇā—this receives the six dharmas; 4) śrāmaṇera, 5) śrāmaṇerikā—these both have ten precepts; 6) upāsaka, 7) upāsikā—these both have five precepts. The first five assemblies are renunciant assemblies. The latter two are lay assemblies. Although the precept characteristics of śikṣamāṇā, śrāmaṇera, and śrāmaṇerikā are numbered as ten precepts, etc., when it comes to maintenance and protection, they are all the same as the complete position. The eight fasting precepts are given to lay assemblies as renunciant precepts. However, their position is only included in lay upāsaka and upāsikā. This is because there are no separate assemblies outside the seven assemblies. The five precepts are: 1) not killing living beings, 2) not stealing, 3) not sexual misconduct, 4) not false speech, 5) not drinking alcohol. The eight fasting precepts are: the first five are the same as above, but sexual misconduct is changed to no sexual activity; 6) using fragrant oils on the body, 7) singing, dancing, and watching entertainment, 8) high, wide, large beds, 9) eating at improper times. The Sarvāstivāda treatise says: eight are precepts, the ninth is fasting. Because fasting and precepts are counted together, there are nine. Speaking of ten precepts: the first nine are the same as above, the tenth is handling gold, silver, and treasures. The six dharmas are: 1) killing animals, 2) stealing three coins, 3) touching, 4) minor false speech, 5) drinking alcohol, 6) eating at improper times. Among these seven assemblies, there are three male assemblies: bhikṣu, śrāmaṇera, and upāsaka. There are four female assemblies: namely the remaining four.

Question: How many teachings does this school establish to encompass all teachings?

Answer: Vinaya Master Nanshan established the two teachings of transformation and regulation to encompass the teachings of one lifetime. They are also called the two teachings of transformation and practice. Transformation teaching refers to the dharma gates of concentration and wisdom explained in sūtras and treatises—the four Āgamas, etc. Regulation teaching refers to the dharma gates of precept study explained in Vinaya teachings—the Four-Part Vinaya, etc. This present school division is precisely the Vinaya Canon teaching, taking precepts as its principle. When precept practice is pure, concentration and wisdom establish themselves. Therefore one first maintains precepts, regulating and prohibiting

wrongful karma. Then afterward concentration and wisdom subdue and eliminate afflictions. Precepts are established for the path, not originally for worldly merit. The noble paths of the three vehicles cannot be established without precepts. Therefore the Tathāgata's original intention in establishing precepts lies here.

Question: As commonly stated, five and eight precepts bring human and divine rewards, while ten precepts and complete precepts only obtain arhat results. How should this doctrine be understood?

Answer: The doctrine is not necessarily thus. If one maintains five or eight precepts and allows causes to produce results, then indeed only human and divine realms result. Ten precepts and complete precepts, allowing causes to produce fruits, are indeed lesser fruits. Based on this doctrine, common understanding speaks thus. But according to mental intention, this doctrine is not so. Therefore Great Wisdom Vinaya Master said: "Precepts have four levels: five, eight, ten, and complete. If regarding dull faculties, they generally serve as worldly good. If discussing superior wisdom, they all serve as foundations for the path." Therefore we know that precept dharmas differ according to spiritual capacity. This is what the present school discusses—the patriarch's established intention.

Question: Among Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna, what exactly is the Four-Part Vinaya school?

Answer: Various Vinaya school masters judge differently. Vinaya Master Huiguang said the Four-Part single Vinaya school is Mahāyāna. Masters Fali, Xuanyun and others all said it is only Hīnayāna. Vinaya Master Nanshan said this Four-Part school doctrinally corresponds to Mahāyāna. Now depending on this doctrine, it flourishes as our foundation. Therefore in the Karma Commentary, five doctrinal categories are established for comprehensive understanding: Sthavira's mind-turning, giving life to achieve buddhahood, giving to all sentient beings so all together achieve the buddha path, understanding and comprehending dusty circumstances, mutually calling each other buddha-children, abandoning material possessions is light—far surpassing other schools, truly profound doctrine. Bundling the above various precepts, there are four categories in total: First, precept dharma—the dharma established by the Tathāgata, because it penetrates myriad circumstances. Second, precept essence—what is produced by the recipient, because the mental faculty receives and accepts it. The present Four-Part school depends on the Satyasiddhi treatise, taking neither form nor mind as essence

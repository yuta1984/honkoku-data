First, the Satyasiddhi school says: "From the initial moment of ignorance, one comes into the three realms. Within the three realms is segmented [death]. Before entering the three realms is transformational birth-and-death. By cultivating the meditation of no-outflows and attaining liberation, cutting off afflictions, one transforms out and returns to Buddhahood." If so, are the time of transformation out and the time of initial arrival one kind of transformation, or are they separate? The interpretations of the treatise masters are not uniform. One says: "There are not two kinds of transformational birth-and-death. Transformation-return experiences the transformation of the time of arrival." Another says: "Since transformation out is already experienced through no-outflows, it experiences a separate transformation. This is not the transformation of the time of initial arrival. The time of initial arrival takes ignorance as its cause. Since the causes are already different, the transformations are also not the same." One theory states: "There is only the transformation of the time of arrival." According to the second theory, there are two kinds of transformation at the time of arrival and transformation. Also, the Humane Kings Sutra explains: "Those who say there are dharmas outside the three realms follow the Great Existence Sutra of the heterodox, not the teachings of the Seven Buddhas." Why then does that treatise say: "From the initial moment of ignorance, one comes to enter within the three realms"? Could there be ignorance beyond the three realms? Please clarify this meaning.

Second, Question: That treatise school says "the four elements are the efficient cause, the four great elements are the proximate cause." Seeing what it explains, why does it resemble what the Samkhya heterodox teach? If we say the treatise master is a descendant of Samkhya masters and therefore describes the original school, having already turned from error to correctness, what benefit is there in further presenting the original school?

Question: The Sarvastivada school says "the dharma-essence of the three periods is eternally existent." Is this eternally existent through arising and ceasing, or eternally existent through non-arising and non-ceasing? If eternally existent through arising and ceasing, then the dharma-essence can have the function of taking and giving results. If eternally existent through non-arising and non-ceasing, then it cannot be called conditioned dharmas.

Essentials of the Eight Schools, Volume 1

Composed by Gyonen

Question: How many gates does Buddhist teaching have? Answer: The Bhagavat's teachings have innumerable gates in total. To mention the main categories, there are eighty-four thousand. The Dharma taught by Shakyamuni during his fifty-year career is all encompassed without exception.

Question: Why must the number of Dharma gates necessarily be thus? Answer: In order to counteract the eighty-four thousand various defilements of all sentient beings. Therefore, the Dharma gates necessarily number eighty-four thousand.

Question: Do these Dharma gates apply only to the Mahayana, or do they also apply to the Hinayana? Answer: The two vehicles of Mahayana and Hinayana each establish eighty-four thousand Dharma gates. As the Abhidharmakosha states: "The Muni taught dharma-aggregates numbering eighty thousand." Many Hinayana sutras also frequently explain that dharmas number eighty-four thousand. These are all established by the Hinayana. In the Mahayana teachings, this principle is extensively discussed with very abundant textual evidence that needs no elaboration. Therefore, both the Mahayana and Hinayana vehicles each establish eighty-four thousand.

Question: How are these Dharma gates collected and organized? Answer: Though the Dharma gates are numerous, they do not exceed the two pitakas and three pitakas. Taking and gathering all teachings, they are all completely exhausted. Even the five pitakas, ten pitakas, twelve-division teachings and other categories do not go beyond the three pitakas.

Question: First, what are the two pitakas? Answer: First is the Shravaka-pitaka, which is the Hinayana. Second is the Bodhisattva-pitaka, which is the Mahayana. That the two vehicles of Mahayana and Hinayana each establish eighty-four thousand refers precisely to this principle. This two-pitaka doctrine appears in the Mahaprajnaparamita-sastra and Mahayanasutralamkara-sastra, and all schools cite them to distinguish between Mahayana and Hinayana.

Question: Next, what are the three pitakas? Answer: First is the Sutra-pitaka (anciently called Sutra, translated as "contractual scripture," anciently simply called "scripture"); second is the Vinaya-pitaka (anciently called Vinaya, meaning "taming," anciently called "precepts"); third is the Abhidharma-pitaka (anciently called Abhidharma, meaning "corresponding to dharma," anciently called "incomparable dharma," which refers to treatise-doctrine). These are called the three pitakas. They respectively explain precepts, concentration, and wisdom. The three pitakas are the teaching that explains; the three trainings are the meaning explained. In gathering dharmas and their meanings, nothing is left out.

Question: How do they gather? Answer: The Tathagata's lifetime teaching was to bestow dharma according to capacity. When there was capacity, he immediately bestowed it, speaking scattered teachings everywhere. However, the scope of the teachings did not exceed the three pitakas. Therefore, at the time of compilation, the various noble ones organized them into the three pitakas. After completely compiling them, they transmitted them to the world.

Question: Do these three pitakas apply to both Mahayana and Hinayana? Answer: Yes, they apply to both. This is clearly explained in treatises like the Mahayanasutralamkara. Therefore, within the two pitakas of Shravakas and Bodhisattvas, there are respectively three pitakas each: sutra, vinaya, and abhidharma.

Question: Regarding these textual teachings, what has been the manner of transmission from ancient to modern times? Answer: When the Tathagata was in the world, written texts were not used. Following what was heard and practicing accordingly, one immediately attained beneficial realization. After the Tathagata's extinction, written texts began to exist, transmitting and opening the eyes of sentient beings. Based on this, Kashyapa and others compiled the Hinayana three pitakas at the cave site of Pipphali, and Ajita and others collected the Mahayana teachings in the middle of the Iron Ring [mountains]. Thereupon Mahakashyapa upheld the sacred Dharma and continued the mysterious guidelines, while the venerable Ananda maintained the contractual standards and benefited living beings. Madhyantika and Shanakavasi each upheld doctrinal guidelines, while Upagupta alone manifested a beautiful epithet. A hundred years after the Buddha's extinction, [the teaching was] poured from vessel [to vessel] with nothing omitted. The five Dharma-master teachers had merit in transmission and maintenance. After a hundred years, various noble ones also appeared, mutually transmitting the sacred texts and each upholding the great Dharma. However, following the disappearance of the various noble ones, the Dharma and its meanings were not without decline. When Ananda entered meditation his birth-garment was immeasurable, when Shanaka entered the assembly and disappeared...

The sutras followed [the path of] disappearance. However, what remains is not small; the remaining teachings are indeed many. Therefore, from the thousand years of the True Dharma through the Final Dharma period, [the teachings] are maintained according to time and transmitted according to place. In the various countries of the five regions of India up to Japan, and countless other nations, each propagates the sacred texts and promotes Buddhist activities. Now, to briefly describe the manner of propagation in the three countries of India, China, and Japan: according to tradition, during the four hundred years after the Tathagata's extinction, Hinayana flourished, various heterodox views arose competitively, and Mahayana was hidden away in the Dragon Palace. Within this period, for one hundred years there was pure transmission from vessel to vessel.

After more than a hundred years, heterodox views arose competitively.

Thus Mahadeva vainly uttered the false words of the Five Points, and Vatsiputriya had not yet abandoned their firm attachment to the substantial self. The Sammatiya and Sautrantika schools disputed over great principles in confusion, while the Western and Northern Mountains raised different views in disorder.

This caused the twenty schools to arise competitively in the land of the five regions of India during the four hundred years, with disputes continuing up to five hundred years.

At five hundred years, heterodox schools arose competitively, Hinayana was somewhat hidden, how much more so Mahayana. At this time Aśvaghoṣa, approaching six hundred years, first propagated Mahayana. The Awakening of Faith and other treatises were composed at this time. The heterodox wrong views all perished with tongues curled, and the different Hinayana schools all submitted with mouths closed. The profound Dharma of Mahayana arose again in Jambudvipa, and the spiritual capacities of sentient beings already tended toward the correct path. Next came Nagarjuna Bodhisattva. From the end of six hundred to the beginning of seven hundred years, he succeeded Aśvaghoṣa and walked alone through the five regions of India. There were no heterodox schools that were not completely crushed, and all Buddhist teachings were transmitted and maintained. He alone contained the three versions of the Avatamsaka in his heart, and skillfully controlled the four eloquences like rivers and seas. He extensively

composed treatises that surpassed their sources like indigo surpassing blue, and deeply fathomed the Buddha Dharma more penetrating than ice. These two great treatise masters were both great beings of high spiritual rank. Aśvaghoṣa was the ancient Buddha Mahāprabha, now manifesting traces at the eighth bhumi. Nagarjuna was formerly Buddha Megharūpa, now dwelling at the first ground of Joy. Both were original Buddhas, both manifesting traces. Their wisdom and eloquence transcended their peers—how fitting this was! Here the great sage manifested in response, his transformative conditions were exhausted, he ceased transformation and returned to the original. The karmic conditions of sentient beings also arose in confusion again, and wrong views became deep once more.

Based on this, at nine hundred years, Asanga Bodhisattva appeared in the world to benefit sentient beings. At night he ascended to Tuṣita and received teachings from Maitreya; during the day he descended to Jambudvipa and extensively taught sentient beings. However, sentient beings' attachments were deep and they still would not follow the transformation. Therefore he immediately requested that the compassionate honored one descend and establish the Dharma himself. The compassionate honored one responded to the request and descended to the Ayodhya lecture hall in central India, expounding the five great treatises. Works like the Yogācāra-bhūmi-śāstra, with two hundred fascicles and eighty-four thousand Dharma gates, deeply discuss the profound meanings. There were no teachings from the Tathagata's lifetime that were not all evaluated. Therefore it is called the "Extensive Commentary on All Sutras and Treatises." At this time sentient beings' wrong views were all subdued, they all proceeded on the correct path together, advancing into wonderful beauty. After the compassionate honored one ascended to heaven, Asanga continued the transformation of Jambudvipa. During this period, Vasubandhu extended transformation, first propagating Hinayana and extensively composing five hundred treatises. Later he studied Mahayana and also composed five hundred treatises. Therefore the world gave him the epithet "Master of a Thousand Treatises." Additionally, Harivarman's Satyasiddhi-śāstra and Saṅghabhadra's Abhidharma-nyāyānusāra were composed at this time. During the thousand years after the Tathagata's extinction, Mahayana doctrines had not yet divided into different views. After 1,100 years, Mahayana began to give rise to different views. Therefore at 1,100 years, Dharmapāla and Bhāviveka debated emptiness and existence; at 1,700 years, Śīlabhadra and Jñānaprabha discussed characteristics and nature with their tongues

and lips. Like vajra against vajra, resembling huge stone against huge stone. The remaining great treatise masters—Nāgabodhi, Āryadeva, Nīlanetra, Rāhulabhadra, Dignāga, Bandhuśrī, Agnivarna, Jñānacandra and others—were all great beings whom sentient beings could rely upon. Outstanding through ancient and modern times, like orchids and chrysanthemums competing in beauty. The various schools each adopted them as founding masters; sentient beings mutually relied on them as leaders. Such treatise masters appeared continuously from ancient times, illuminating the five regions of India and saving sentient beings. This constitutes the manner of propagation in India. As for China, at the end of the thousand years after the Tathagata's extinction, Kāśyapa Mātaṅga first arrived, and Zhu Falan came next. They began transmitting the Three Jewels and gradually propagated the five vehicles. Since then, during the Han, Wei, Jin, Song, Qi, Liang, Chen, Sui, Tang, and Song dynasties, the tripiṭaka masters of these courts each transmitted Buddhist teaching and mutually propagated the sacred Dharma. As for the translation tripiṭaka masters, some came from the west to here, others went back and forth from here. The Mahayana and Hinayana tripiṭakas were all completely translated and transmitted, and the exoteric and esoteric schools mutually propagated each other. Thus when Kumārajīva and Xuanzang perfected the art of translation, they indeed received divine announcements from the devas. When Buddhabhadra and Dharmarakṣa were praised for their beautiful transmission and translation, they accordingly received divine protection from sea dragons. Among other eminent monks who revered the Buddha Dharma: the moons of Jinling (Jiaxiang) and Jingying (Huiyuan) were clear in the waters of the eight negations and manifest reality; the flowers of Nanyue (Huisi) and Tiantai (Zhiyi) were fresh in the garden of one mind and three contemplations. The wind of Cien (Kuiji) and Zizhou (Huizhao) was cool on the branches of the three plants and two trees; the jewels of Xiangxiang (Fazang) and Qingliang (Chengguan) were bright on the platform of ten mysteries and six characteristics. Additionally, masters Guang and Bao thoroughly illuminated abhidharma clearly; the Li and Xuan schools polished the precepts and vinaya distinctly. How much more so regarding the great meaning of Satyasiddhi—Hui(yuan) and (Hui)ying were uniquely beautiful; regarding the esoteric teaching of Mantra—Xing(huai) and Guo(an) were both brilliant. The countless other virtuous ones all propagated the great Way and mutually transmitted

Buddhist teaching. Their awesome virtue was towering, frequently receiving heavenly support; their wonderful understanding was vast, often seeing the Buddha in their minds. Such eminent monks, throughout ancient and modern times—how many! How great! How could words possibly suffice to describe them! This is what we call the manner of propagation in China. As for Japan, during the reign of the thirtieth sovereign Emperor Kinmei, in the sixth year, the cyclical year yitsu-ushi (corresponding to the eighth year of Datong of the Liang), in the eleventh month, King Seimei of Baekje presented a bronze statue of Śākyamuni, along with banners, canopies, and various sutras and treatises. The emperor was delighted and immediately revered them. Although the court ministers did not respect them at the time, temple buildings were eventually constructed and Buddhist sutras were installed. Thereafter the Three Jewels were gradually established. In the thirty-first generation, on New Year's Day of the first year of Emperor Bidatsu, Prince Shōtoku was born in Japan and further propagated the Buddha Dharma, spreading it widely throughout the realm. Temple halls were built everywhere, and countless people were ordained. The rebellious minister Moriya was struck down by the bow and arrows of meditative wisdom, while the two Korean monks gained praise for propagation. [The prince] subdued wrong views, issued edicts exalting the Three Jewels, saved sentient beings, and performed Buddhist works. Throughout the thousands of years past, where could this be surpassed? This was entirely due to the skillful power of Prince Shōtoku of the Upper Palace. Since then, eminent monks appeared frequently, widely transmitting the Buddha Dharma. Great sages manifested traces and propagated the Three Jewels. Archbishop Egwan transmitted the profound meaning of the Three Treatises, and Archbishop Genbō propagated Yogācāra Mahayana. The complete Avatamsaka school was transmitted by Vinaya Master Dōsen. The precepts and Tiantai were propagated by Master Jianzhen. The Great Master Dengyō (Saichō) revived Tiantai, and the Great Master Kōbō (Kūkai) flourished in opening Shingon. Abhidharmakosha and Satyasiddhi each had their transmissions. Among these various worthy ones, some came from Tang China to here, others went back and forth from here. The many other masters had very extensive propagation and transmission. All, before and after, played with Dharmas as mentioned above: some drew from the streams of jade springs, some transmitted the light of the sun of wisdom, some received the full moon of Qingliang, some became jade

How is this so?

Answer: The ultimate way is mysteriously supreme; words and discussion cannot reach it. If one speaks of existence, one returns to foolishness; if one speaks of non-existence, it is not wisdom. This is what Subhūti criticized and what Śāriputra was reproached for. Neither existence nor non-existence. Neither both existence and non-existence. Neither non-existence nor non-existence. Language is cut off, mental activity ceases. Tranquil and without foundation, empty and without support. Not knowing how to describe it, we forcefully call it "revealing correctness."

Question: When language is completely cut off and existence and non-existence are both eliminated, this is the meaning of emptiness. How does this relate to revealing correctness?

Answer: Having already eliminated existence and non-existence, why dwell in emptiness? The great essence of the Buddha-way truly has no foundation. Because existence and non-existence are both cut off, there is nothing attained. The purpose of revealing correctness culminates in this.

Question: Having already eliminated existence and non-existence, how then can conditioned dharmas be established?

Answer: Conditioned dharmas are provisionally existent. Provisional existence is precisely non-attainment. The two truths are established through this; the four propositions are formed depending on this. Through conventional truth, all dharmas are established without disturbing the true reality. Through ultimate truth, true characteristics are explained without destroying conventional designations. Therefore emptiness is clearly existent, and existence is clearly empty. The meaning of "form is emptiness, emptiness is form" lies here. The two truths are merely textual teachings, not related to objects and principles. Because of dependence on conditions there are two truths; because of true reality the two truths are eliminated. Because existence is the existence of emptiness, even when speaking of existence, it is not existence. Because emptiness is the emptiness of existence, even when speaking of emptiness, it is not emptiness. Because it is not existence, one discusses emptiness precisely in existence; because it is not emptiness, one explains existence precisely in emptiness. That all Buddhas always teach according to the two truths is precisely this meaning.

What this school reveals is simply this correct contemplation of non-attainment. Therefore the ancients said: "The wind of the wonderful principle of eight negations brushes away the dust of false thoughts and conceptual elaborations; the moon of correct contemplation of non-attainment floats in the water of the one reality of the middle way."

Because of non-attainment, conventionally designated dharmas naturally manifest in profusion. This can be understood by analogy with the above.

Question: How does this school discuss the attainment of Buddha-fruit?

Answer: All sentient beings are originally Buddha. Sentient beings of the six realms are originally tranquil and extinct by themselves. There is no delusion and no awakening. How could one discuss attainment or non-attainment? Therefore in this school, delusion and awakening are originally non-existent, tranquilly extinct. However, within the gate of conventional designations, one merely discusses delusion, awakening, attainment and non-attainment.

Because of this principle, becoming Buddha has speed and slowness. This is because roots have sharpness and dullness. Awakening in one thought-moment is brief; becoming Buddha in three asaṃkhyeya kalpas is long.

One moment does not obstruct three asaṃkhyeyas; three asaṃkhyeyas do not hinder one moment. One moment is precisely three asaṃkhyeyas; three asaṃkhyeyas is precisely one moment. Like dreaming of a hundred years' events in one night's sleep, the hundred years' events return to being just one night. Through three asaṃkhyeyas, myriad practices accumulate to completion; in one moment, Buddha-fruit is swift.

Question: For those who accumulate practices through three asaṃkhyeyas, how many stages do they pass through?

Answer: In three asaṃkhyeyas, bodhisattvas pass through fifty-one stages and then reach Buddha-fruit, so this school establishes fifty-two stages. Therefore in this school's view, the essence of awakening is originally present, and because of delusion there is birth and death. Returning from delusion to the source, when one simply brushes away adventitious defilements, the originally present essence of awakening manifests clearly. This is called the Buddha of initial awakening. One should know that awakening is established in response to delusion, and delusion exists in response to awakening. When awakening arises there is no delusion; without delusion, what awakening could there be? No delusion, no awakening. Delusion and awakening are originally non-existent, originally tranquil and extinct. Delusion, awakening, defilement, and purity are conventional designations. Correct contemplation of non-attainment wonderfully reaches the ultimate of the supreme way.

Question: What are those eight negations?

Answer: No-arising, no-ceasing, no-cutting-off, no-permanence, no-oneness, no-difference, no-going, no-coming. Because the eight delusions are eliminated, these

eight negations are taught. This is precisely the principle that this school reveals.

When this school explains all dharmas, there are four types of explanation. First, explanation according to names; second, explanation through causes and conditions; third, explanation through seeing the way; fourth, unrestricted explanation. All dharma-gates can be explained through these. It also establishes four levels of two truths.

First, existence as conventional truth and emptiness as ultimate truth. Second, existence and emptiness as conventional, and neither emptiness nor existence as ultimate. Third, emptiness, existence, neither emptiness nor existence as conventional, and neither non-existence nor non-emptiness as ultimate truth. Fourth, the previous as conventional, and neither non-non-existence nor non-non-emptiness as ultimate. This is precisely to refute non-Buddhists, Abhidharma, Mahāyāna with attainment, etc.

Question: How many teachings does this school establish to encompass all teachings?

Answer: It establishes two piṭakas and three turnings of the dharma wheel to encompass the teachings of one lifetime. The two piṭakas are: first, the śrāvaka piṭaka, which is Hīnayāna teaching; second, the bodhisattva piṭaka, which is Mahāyāna teaching. The great and small teachings are completely encompassed within these. This follows the Treatise on Great Wisdom. The three turnings of the dharma wheel are: first, the fundamental dharma wheel, which is the Avataṃsaka; second, the branch dharma wheel, from the Āgamas onward up to the Lotus Sūtra; third, the dharma wheel that gathers the branches back to the root, which is the Lotus Sūtra. All sūtras of one lifetime are completely encompassed. This comes from the Lotus Sūtra.

The great and small vehicles reveal the same principle, but differ according to different capacities. Various Mahāyāna sūtras reveal the same undifferentiated way, but have distinctions in response to different conditions. In judging various Mahāyāna sūtras, each establishes three levels: equal, superior, and inferior. In judging all teachings, there is definitely no one-sided understanding.

Question: Who does this school regard as patriarch?

Answer: The patriarchal lineage has been transmitted through three countries, with teachers successively following in each other's footsteps—this school's record is truly clear. Initially, the great sage Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva is the founding patriarch, next Aśvaghoṣa Bodhisattva as second patriarch. Next, Nāgārjuna

Bodhisattva wonderfully propagated this school. Nāgārjuna transmitted to Nāgabuddhi Bodhisattva and Āryadeva Bodhisattva. These two great treatise masters worked shoulder to shoulder in spreading the teaching. Nāgabuddhi transmitted to Bhāviveka Bodhisattva, Bhāviveka to Jñānaprabha, and Jñānaprabha to Siṃhaprabha Bodhisattva. That Āryadeva Bodhisattva had extremely profound wisdom and understanding, unparalleled eloquence, greatly refuted non-Buddhists, and vigorously promoted Buddhist teaching. The treatise master transmitted this school to Rāhulabhadra Bodhisattva. Rāhulabhadra transmitted to the Prince of Kashgar, and the prince transmitted to Tripiṭaka Kumārajīva. Tripiṭaka Kumārajīva came to China during the Yao Qin period, extensively translated sūtras and treatises, and exclusively transmitted this school. The four treatises are precisely what Master Kumārajīva translated. The excellence of his translations has been praised through ancient and modern times, and his profound wisdom was revered throughout the three countries (India, Kucha, and China). His disciples surrounded him like stars encircling the bright moon; dynasties looked to him for guidance like countless streams flowing into the great ocean. Seng Sheng, Seng Zhao, Dao Rong, and Seng Rui worked shoulder to shoulder in succession; Hui Ying, Hui Guan, Dao Heng, and Dao Ji shared the same aspiration in praising beautifully. Thus Master Tan Ji continued the succession and transmission, passing it to Master Dao Lang. Dao Lang transmitted to Master Seng Quan, Seng Quan to Master Fa Lang, and Fa Lang to Master Jia Xiang. Master Jia Xiang was originally from a foreign country. In his youth he followed his father to Chinese territory. He studied the three treatises under Master Fa Lang. He was truly the cornerstone of the dharma-gate, outstanding through ancient and modern times. His majestic virtue manifested the awesome power of an elephant king; his clear wisdom and eloquence surpassed the illumination of sun and moon. His writings were numerous and he widely distributed volumes. The Three Treatises and Lotus were both his heart's treasury; he thoroughly fathomed the mysterious depths of both great and small vehicles. The great flourishing of the Three Treatises was exclusively due to this master. Among all patriarchs, he is especially designated as the great patriarch. His explanations exhausted all principles—none could match him. He then transmitted the Three Treatises to Korean Meditation Master Hye Gwan. The meditation master came to Japan.

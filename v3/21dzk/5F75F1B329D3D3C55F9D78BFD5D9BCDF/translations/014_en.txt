What they contemplate differs from each other. Śrāvakas contemplate the Four Noble Truths, pratyekabuddhas contemplate the twelve-link dependent origination, and bodhisattvas cultivate the six perfections.

When the three vehicles attain fruit, they all enter nirvāṇa without remainder, reducing the body to ashes and extinguishing consciousness. This teaching clarifies the dharmas of arising-and-ceasing Four Noble Truths, twelve-link dependent origination, six perfections, two truths, etc. This is the phenomenal teaching within the three realms. The second, Shared Teaching, has four gates and mostly clarifies the emptiness gate. This teaching clarifies the ten stages common to the three vehicles. Those ten stages are: first, the stage of withered wisdom is the outer ordinary stage. Second, the stage of nature is the inner ordinary stage. Third, the stage of eight persons; fourth, the stage of seeing, which cuts off the view-delusions of the three realms—this is the first fruit. Fifth, the stage of thinning is the once-returner fruit. Sixth, the stage of freedom from desire is the non-returner fruit. Seventh, the stage of accomplishment is the arhat fruit. Śrāvakas proceed from the beginning to here, reaching the ash-extinction of nirvāṇa without remainder. Eighth, the pratyekabuddha stage eliminates habitual tendencies and enters emptiness contemplation. Pratyekabuddhas reach here to realize fruit and enter quiescence. Ninth, the bodhisattva stage is the position of emerging from provisional. Bodhisattvas reaching here move beyond countless eons, emerge from the provisional to benefit beings, and the paths of contemplation flow together. Tenth, the Buddha stage: the bodhisattva's final body cuts off remaining habitual tendencies, achieves enlightenment under the seven-jewel tree with heavenly robes as seat, and enters quiescence. This teaching clarifies the dharmas of no-arising Four Noble Truths, twelve-link dependent origination, two truths, etc. This is the principle teaching within the three realms. The third, Distinct Teaching, also has four gates and mostly uses the both-existence-and-emptiness gate. This teaching clarifies fifty-two stages. First, the ten faiths are the outer ordinary stage, entering emptiness from the provisional. Second, the ten abodes are the stage of acquired seed-nature. The first abode cuts off view-delusions of the three realms, the next six abodes cut off cultivation-delusions of the three realms, the latter three abodes eliminate the habitual tendencies of previous delusions along with dust-like delusions. At this stage emptiness contemplation is achieved, and one studies provisional and middle contemplations alongside. Third, the ten practices are the inherent seed-nature stage, properly studying provisional

contemplation and studying middle contemplation alongside, breaking dust-like delusions. Fourth, the ten dedications are the path seed-nature, cultivating middle-way contemplation and subduing ignorance. These abodes, practices, and dedications are inner ordinary stages. Fifth, the ten grounds are the sage seed-nature. Sixth, near-perfect enlightenment—these two both break ignorance and partially realize the middle way, called the partial sage stage. Seventh, wondrous enlightenment is the ultimate sage stage, breaking ignorance and realizing Buddha-fruit, achieving enlightenment with the seven jewels as seat. This teaching clarifies immeasurable Four Noble Truths, twelve-link dependent origination, etc. This is the phenomenal teaching beyond the three realms. This school clarifies obstructions by generally establishing three delusions: first, view-and-thought delusions; second, dust-like delusions; third, ignorance delusions. View-and-thought are delusions within the three realms, so they are cut off by the three vehicles of the Tripiṭaka and Shared teachings. Dust-like and ignorance are delusions beyond the three realms, so they are cut off by the Distinct and Perfect teachings. The fifty-two stages completely subdue and cut these three delusions. The six identities of the Perfect Teaching are the same. The fourth, Perfect Teaching, also has four gates and mostly discusses the neither-existence-nor-emptiness gate. This teaching establishes six identity stages. First, principle identity: the one-moment mind of all sentient beings is the Tathāgatagarbha principle. This mind contains the wondrous principle of the three truths and is inconceivable—this is called principle identity. Second, name identity: hearing the one true bodhi explained above, one penetrates and understands within names and words, knowing that all dharmas are Buddha-dharmas—this is name identity. Third, contemplative practice identity is the five grades stage, the ten faiths complete, the contemplation where ten dharmas become the vehicle. Reading and reciting scriptures, adding preaching, practicing the six perfections alongside and properly—cultivating these practices is called the five grades stage. This is the outer ordinary stage. Fourth, resembling identity is the purification of six sense organs, the iron-wheel ten faiths stage. The first faith cuts view-delusions of the three realms, the next six faiths cut thought-delusions of the three realms, the latter three grades cut habitual tendencies along with dust-like delusions beyond the three realms, subduing ignorance delusions. This is the inner ordinary stage. Fifth, partial reality identity includes the ten abodes, ten practices,

ten dedications, ten grounds, and near-perfect enlightenment. Within these forty-one stages, each cuts one grade of ignorance and each manifests one portion of middle-way principle, all demonstrating the eight aspects of achieving Buddhahood to save sentient beings, manifesting through universal gates to benefit various capacities. This is called the partial sage stage. Sixth, ultimate identity: near-perfect enlightenment turns once to enter wondrous enlightenment. Buddha-fruit is perfectly complete with cutting and realization reaching the ultimate. This teaching clarifies unconditioned Four Noble Truths, twelve-link dependent origination, etc.

Question: Among the three bodies, what are the Buddha-fruits discussed by the four teachings?

Answer: The Tripiṭaka and Shared teachings are response-bodies. Among them, the Tripiṭaka teaching is the inferior response-body, the Shared teaching is the superior response-body. The Distinct teaching is the other-enjoyment body. The Perfect teaching is the self-enjoyment body. Principle and wisdom merge mysteriously, interpenetrating without obstruction—the three bodies are the one Tathāgata.

Question: In what kinds of lands do the Buddhas of the four teachings reside?

Answer: This school establishes four kinds of Buddha-lands. First, the land where [ordinary beings and sages] dwell together, because ordinary and sage beings dwell mixed together. The inferior response-body Buddha discussed by the Tripiṭaka teaching resides within this land. Within this there are two: first, the defiled land where [ordinary and sage beings] dwell together, like Sahā, etc.; second, the pure land where [ordinary and sage beings] dwell together, like Amitābha's Pure Land, etc. Second, the land of expedient means with remainder exists beyond the three realms. Only people of the three vehicles, having left behind bodies of the three realms, dwell in that pure land. The superior response-body Buddha discussed by the Shared teaching resides in this land. Third, the land of true reward: bodhisattvas of the ten grounds of the Distinct teaching and the ten abodes and above of the Perfect teaching cut ignorance delusions, manifest middle-way principle, and dwell in that land. Speaking of the teaching-master, this is the other-enjoyment body clarified by the Distinct teaching. Fourth, the land of quiescent light: only the Buddha's true body dwells in that pure land. Capacities are completely transcended—this is the realm of Buddha and Buddha. This is the four virtues' perfection, universally pervading in quiescent illumination, principle and wisdom mysteriously merged, where the Dharma-body dwells. The Buddhas of the four teachings reside in these four lands. Using these four teachings to classify all the great and small teachings of the Tathāgata's lifetime,

nothing is not completely covered. The general outline of the four transformation-method teachings is thus. Next, the four transformation-manner teachings are: first, sudden teaching, like the Avataṃsaka Sūtra; second, gradual teaching—the three periods of Āgama, Vaipulya, and Prajñā; third, indeterminate teaching—capacities' understanding differs, hearing the same but understanding differently, hearing the great but understanding the small, hearing the small but understanding the great, etc., yet mutually knowing each other, called indeterminate teaching; fourth, secret teaching—in one assembly's teaching, different teachings are given according to capacity: sometimes teaching the one true dharma in an assembly teaching the small, or teaching other dharmas in an assembly teaching the great, yet they don't know each other—therefore called secret teaching. This is collectively called the four transformation-manner teachings. One should know: what transformation-manner discusses doesn't go beyond transformation-method, and transformation-method's teaching manner doesn't exceed transformation-manner. Therefore eight teachings are established as the classification framework—this is the great outline and detailed structure.

The five periods are: Avataṃsaka, Āgama, Vaipulya, Prajñā, and Lotus-Nirvāṇa. In the sequence of transformation-manner, the teachings of one lifetime don't exceed these five, called the five flavors. This school's hundred realms and thousand suchnesses, three thousand worlds, are completely present in one moment of thought, neither vertical nor horizontal. Establishing the two truths, there are seven levels in total. The four kinds of samādhi serve as the method of practice. The three contemplations in one mind are complete and perfect, mutually identical and free, unobstructed and perfectly interfused. Seeing Buddha while being ordinary, manifesting the ordinary while being Buddha. When the three thousand exist in principle, they are all called ignorance; when the three thousand achieve fruition, they are all called eternal bliss. The wondrous essence of today's Lotus Sūtra truly lies here. Among all teachings, this teaching is supreme. Among all schools, this is the most profound. Transcending the eight extremes in perfect roundness, its essence is deep and lofty. Swift attainment of great fruit is also wondrous.

meaning. The latter three portions encompass both perceiver and perceived. Thus the eight consciousness mind-kings and mental factors each have four portions. Although the eight consciousnesses each have one essence, when discussing their function, they have four portions. Therefore the eight consciousnesses have four portions.

This school clarifies the meaning of truth and falsity, establishing three natures in total. First is the nature of conceptual construction (parikalpita). This is the appearance manifesting to consciousness. This is also divided into three: that which conceptually constructs, that which is conceptually constructed, and conceptual construction itself. The first two are encompassed by other-dependence. Conceptual construction is the appearance manifesting to consciousness—considering what is non-existent as existent, grasping it falsely.

Second is other-dependent nature (paratantra). These are dharmas arising from four conditions, existing through the harmony of causes and conditions. Third is perfectly accomplished nature (pariniṣpanna). This is the principle-nature of all dharmas, possessing the three meanings of perfection, accomplishment, and reality. Among these three natures, conceptual construction is falsely existent, other-dependence is provisionally existent, and perfect accomplishment is truly existent. Conceptual construction is already false grasping, while other-dependence and perfect accomplishment are wonderfully true. The three natures are mutually distinct and do not intermingle.

However, other-dependent phenomena and perfectly accomplished principle-nature are neither one nor different. Characteristics do not separate from essence; essence does not separate from characteristics. The Thirty Verses explains the three natures in a verse saying: "Through various conceptual constructions, all kinds of things are conceptually constructed. This conceptual construction has no inherent nature. Other-dependent nature arises from discriminating conditions. Perfect accomplishment constantly transcends the former nature in regard to that. Therefore this and other-dependence are neither different nor not-different. Like the nature of impermanence, etc., without seeing this, one does not see that."

Corresponding to these three natures, three naturelessnesses are clarified. By overturning conceptual construction, other-dependence, and perfect accomplishment, the three naturelessnesses of characteristics, arising, and ultimate meaning are respectively revealed. Therefore the Thirty Verses states: "Based on these three natures, those three naturelessnesses are established. Therefore the Buddha taught with hidden intention that all dharmas are natureless. The first is naturelessness of characteristics, the second is non-natural nature, the third is through

transcending the previously grasped nature of self and dharmas." Like the above three natures, they also do not separate from consciousness. Those three naturelessnesses are established based on the three natures. The Consciousness-Only Treatise states: "One should know that the three natures also do not separate from consciousness."

It also states: "Based on the three natures explained before, the three types of naturelessness explained later are established." Cultivation at all stages observes consciousness-only. What the Buddha-fruit realizes is simply consciousness-only. Therefore myriad practices arise from consciousness-only, and myriad virtues are experienced through dependence on consciousness-only.

This school transforms the eight consciousnesses to accomplish four wisdoms. These four wisdoms are: first, great perfect mirror wisdom; second, equality wisdom; third, wonderful observing wisdom; fourth, accomplishing-action wisdom. When entering the first ground, the sixth and seventh consciousnesses are transformed to attain wonderful observing wisdom and equality wisdom. When reaching Buddha-fruit, the fifth and eighth consciousnesses are transformed to attain perfect mirror wisdom and accomplishing-action wisdom. At this time the four wisdoms are perfected and the wonderful fruits of the two transformations become clear.

The principle realized has four nirvanas: first, originally pure nature nirvana; second, nirvana with remainder; third, nirvana without remainder; fourth, non-abiding nirvana. The first is possessed even by ordinary beings, the middle two are attained by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, but only Buddha-fruit tathāgatas possess all four types.

These four are collectively called the pure dharma-realm. Adding the previous four wisdoms makes five dharmas. Regarding how the five dharmas and three bodies correspond, the Consciousness-Only Treatise has explanations by two masters. The first master's view is that the pure dharma-realm and great perfect mirror wisdom constitute the dharma-body, equality and wonderful observing constitute the reward-body, and accomplishing-action wisdom constitutes the transformation-body. The second master's view is that the pure dharma-realm is the self-nature body, the characteristics above the four wisdoms are self-enjoyment use, the body manifested by equality wisdom is other-enjoyment use, and the body manifested by accomplishing-action wisdom

is the transformation body. Wonderful observing wisdom is the wisdom that teaches dharma and resolves doubts. This school's orthodox position takes the second master as guidance.

One should know that cultivation through the five stages progressively reaches exhaustion, the habitual tendencies of the two obstructions are completely eliminated. Through the vast kalpas of three asaṃkhyeyas, myriad good qualities reach completion, encompassed in a single moment. Buddha-fruit is swift. The defiled eight consciousnesses are transformed to attain the four wisdoms. The wonderful fruits of the two transformations, the three bodies perfected, are tranquilly clear and luminously bright.

Additionally, the five vehicles are universally taught and transformed, the three vehicles each reach their ultimate. The one vehicle is skillful means; the three vehicles are reality. Before fundamental wisdom, true principle is tranquil. Within subsequently attained wisdom, sentient beings are universally transformed. Relying on expressions to discuss the meaning, the three natures and three naturelessnesses hang like mirrors. Abandoning expressions to discuss meaning, the four propositions and hundred negations cease conceptualization. For decisive judgment of nature and characteristics, nothing equals this school. For the ultimate establishment of meaning and principle, what teaching can compare to this? The moon of the three bodies of self-realization is full; the light of the five vehicles for transforming others is bright. Self-realization and transforming others are profoundly vast. The purpose of the supreme vehicle has complete meaning and principle. The general outline of the Dharma-Characteristics school's tenets is like this.

　　　Three Treatises School

Question: Why is it called the Three Treatises School?

Answer: Because it relies on three treatises as its fundamental basis, it is called the Three Treatises School.

Question: What are those three treatises?

Answer: First is the Middle Treatise in four volumes, composed by Bodhisattva Nāgārjuna. Second is the Hundred Treatise in two volumes, composed by Bodhisattva Āryadeva. Third is the Twelve Gate Treatise in one volume, composed by Bodhisattva Nāgārjuna. These are called the three treatises. However, if the Treatise on Great Wisdom in one hundred volumes is added, it becomes four treatises. This was also composed by Bodhisattva Nāgārjuna. Among these four treatises, the three treatises are comprehensive expositions that comprehensively explain both

Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna teachings. The Wisdom Treatise is a specific exposition that specifically explains the Great Perfection of Wisdom. If the Wisdom Treatise were fully translated, it would be about one thousand volumes. Tripiṭaka Kumārajīva reduced it by nine-tenths, selecting the essential parts and translating it into one hundred volumes.

Regarding the three treatises: the Middle Treatise primarily refutes the Hīnayāna while also refuting non-Buddhist schools, revealing Mahāyāna meaning. The Hundred Treatise primarily refutes non-Buddhist schools while incidentally refuting others, revealing Mahāyāna meaning. The Twelve Gate Treatise refutes both Hīnayāna and non-Buddhist schools, directly revealing the profound meaning of Mahāyāna. What the three treatises clarify does not go beyond the two truths.

Generally, this school's main intention takes the two approaches of refuting error and revealing correctness as its standard. Though there are three treatises, there are only two tracks. Refuting error saves those below from sinking into delusion; revealing correctness draws them above to the great dharma. Grasping the essentials and fundamental principles, there are only these two tracks. This forms a great school.

Question: What does this refutation of error involve?

Answer: It generally refutes all views that have attainment. Briefly explaining, it does not go beyond four views. First, refuting the heterodox view of non-Buddhists regarding a real self. Second, refuting the grasping view of Abhidharma regarding real existence. Third, breaking the emotional view of the Satyasiddhi school regarding pervasive emptiness. Fourth, destroying the views and understanding of Mahāyāna with attainment. Internal and external are completely refuted; great and small are universally broken. All views with attainment are universally eliminated and refuted. Therefore nothing is not refuted; nothing is not criticized. This is called this school's meaning of refuting error.

Question: What correctness does this revealing of correctness reveal?

Answer: Beyond refuting error, there is no separate revealing of correctness. When error is completely refuted, there is nothing attained. When attainment already does not exist, words and thoughts have no basis. However, in response to refuting error, there is also revealing correctness. If even one source is not exhausted, then conceptual elaboration does not cease. If even the slightest principle is not exhausted, then the ultimate way does not appear. Because no source is left unexhausted, conceptual elaboration thus ceases. Because no principle is left unexhausted, the mysterious way becomes accessible. Relying on words to discuss correctness, nothing fails to be clearly revealed.

Question: If so, then this meaning of revealing correctness is

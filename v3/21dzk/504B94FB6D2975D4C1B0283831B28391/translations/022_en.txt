This is called present reward benefit. In one body, two benefits are obtained.

**Great and Small Vinaya Schools**

The study of vinaya is the ladder to heavenly birth and the bridge to entering sagehood. Moral conduct is the primary cause of bodhi and the seed-nature of the Well-Gone One. Moreover, it is the foundation of samāhita (concentration) and the fortress of samāpatti (meditative attainment). Rather than embracing death from thirst, one would not drink water containing insects. How could one value avoiding bondage over injuring grass and leaves? By firmly protecting the floating bag, the path ahead can be expected. By firmly holding the virtue vessel, excellent conditions present no difficulty. To pursue such diligence depends solely on vinaya teachings; to escape such dangers relies solely on moral conduct. Therefore, let me briefly indicate one corner.

There are four names in total. First is called "vinaya" (律). Vinaya means dharma. Regarding teaching, measuring and determining severity is called vinaya. Regarding practice, taming the three karmas is called vinaya. Second is called "precepts" (戒). Regarding teaching, the dharma that prevents wrongdoing is called precepts. Regarding practice, the mind that stops evil is called precepts. Third is called "pratimoksha" (波羅提木叉). This is Sanskrit, translated as "individual liberation." It means individually liberating from transgressions and evil. Fourth is called "vinaya" (毘尼). This is Sanskrit, translated as "extinction." Regarding teaching, what can pacify disputes is called extinction. Regarding practice, it is called extinction because it cuts off samsara.

Q: "What are the distinctions between these four names?"
A: "The first two concern causes: being internally cautious is called vinaya; preventing externally is called precepts. The latter two concern results: exhausting afflictions is called liberation; the mutual disappearance of body and wisdom is called extinction."

Q: "The dharma taught by the Buddha is contained in the Three Baskets: first, the Sutra Basket (translated as 'contractual sutras'); second, the Vinaya Basket (translated as 'taming'); third, the Abhidharma Basket (translated as 'Dharma analysis'). Among these three baskets, which contains this vinaya?"
A: "It is contained in the Vinaya Basket."

Q: "How many divisions does this Vinaya Basket have?"
A: "There are five vinayas and five treatises that clarify these precepts and vinaya."

Q: "What are these five vinayas?"
A: "The five vinayas are: first, the Ten Recitations Vinaya (representing Sarvāstivāda doctrine, establishing ten types of receiving precepts); second, the Four-Part Vinaya (Dharmaguptaka doctrine); third, the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya (Mahāsāṃghika doctrine); fourth, the Five-Part Vinaya (Mahīśāsaka doctrine); fifth, the Kāśyapa Vinaya (this latter vinaya had no connection with this land and was not transmitted). The former four vinayas have come and been transmitted to this land."

Q: "What are the five treatises?"
A: "First, the Vinaya Mother Treatise; second, the Mātṛkā Treatise; third, the Samantapāsādikā; fourth, the Sarvāstivāda Treatise; fifth, the Spaṣṭārtha Treatise. These five treatises each have distinct meanings."

Q: "Why is the Vinaya Basket divided into five types with five treatises?"
A: "Five masters - Kāśyapa, Ānanda, Upāli, Anuruddha, and Upagupta - transmitted [the teachings] across generations as one Great Vinaya Basket. Upagupta had five disciples, each with different views, who divided it into five parts in the same generation, hence five vinayas."

Q: "Śrāvaka precepts number 250. Among these, the four grave [precepts] are sexual misconduct, stealing, killing, and false speech, while the remaining precepts are light precepts. For bodhisattva precepts, according to the Brahmajāla Sutra, there are ten grave and forty-eight light precepts; according to the Bodhisattva Stages, four grave and thirty-three light precepts; according to the Upāsaka Precepts Sutra, twenty grave precepts. Why do śrāvaka precepts place sexual misconduct first and other precepts after, while bodhisattva precepts place killing first and other precepts after?"
A: "In śrāvaka precepts, initially prohibiting sexual misconduct has two meanings. One explanation follows the order of which precepts were first broken. Another explanation is that śrāvaka practitioners fundamentally abhor samsara and aspire to seek bodhi, therefore sexual misconduct comes first, following the order of severity. Bodhisattva practice does not abhor samsara or delight in bodhi; great compassionate action is considered supreme, therefore killing comes first, following the order of severity."

Q: "Why do śrāvakas consider sexual misconduct most serious?"
A: "Sexual misconduct is the root of samsara, therefore it follows severity."

Q: "Why is sexual activity the root of samsara?"
A: "When husband and wife unite, they become attached to the world, descendants continue, and they enjoy worldly affairs. Through this, confusion and karma arise, continuing the wheel of samsaric rebirth. Because they desire bodhi quickly, they first separate from this."

Q: "Why must bodhisattvas take compassion as primary in their practice?"
A: "Great bodhisattva beings make the dharmadhātu their home, the six realms their relatives, and the four types of birth their children. They first delight in saving others, then seek self-salvation, therefore compassion is fundamental."

Q: "In śrāvaka precepts, if one person violates the sexual misconduct precept with one woman, are all previously received sexual misconduct precepts completely destroyed?"
A: "The precepts regarding one woman are completely broken, but the precepts regarding other women remain entirely unbroken."

Q: "When violating the sexual misconduct precept with one woman, having no sincere fear toward all women, what obstruction does the violation have? Why are the precepts regarding others not broken?"
A: "When initially receiving precepts, the wholesome precepts regarding all women in the dharmadhātu were already generated. How could violating with one person cause loss of those precepts? Therefore, the others remain completely intact. Within one precept, breaking with strong defilement destroys the precept, but violating with medium or weak defilement does not necessarily destroy the precept."

Q: "If so, how about other precepts?"
A: "Other precepts are the same."

Q: "If so, why does violating one result in 'not dwelling together'?"
A: "Because guilt is incurred from the violation, the community does not associate [with that person]. This does not refer to other wholesome [qualities]."

Q: "If so, can one who violates one [precept] serve as a human teacher?"
A: "Although violating with one person, if violating precepts with strong defilement, one cannot serve as a teacher. If violating precepts with medium or weak defilement, having other wholesome qualities, what prevents serving as a teacher?"

Q: "Based on which vinaya is this explanation made?"
A: "This is the meaning of the Ten Recitations [Vinaya]; it should be understood thus."

Q: "Bhikṣu precepts number 250. If divided comprehensively, how many divisions contain them all?"
A: "Comprehensively divided into subsidiary parts, they are contained in four subsidiary divisions."

Q: "What are the four subsidiaries?"
A: "First, the subsidiary of receiving full [ordination]; second, the subsidiary of receiving subsequent dharma training places; third, the subsidiary of protecting others' minds; fourth, the subsidiary of protecting training places as received."

Q: "What is called the subsidiary of receiving full [ordination]?"
A: "The initial declaration, the fourth karma [procedure], and briefly containing the reception of subsequent coarse training places is called the subsidiary of receiving full [ordination]. At that time one is called a great bhikṣu."

Q: "What is called the subsidiary of receiving subsequent dharma training places?"
A: "After becoming a great bhikṣu, thereafter protecting and practicing all precepts, broadly protecting the disciplinary rules within vinaya teachings is called the subsidiary of subsequent dharma training places."

Q: "What is called the subsidiary of protecting others' minds?"
A: "By accomplishing the former two, having complete deportment and complete conduct is called the subsidiary of protecting others' minds."

Q: "What is called the subsidiary of protecting training places as received?"
A: "Deeply seeing fear in subtle transgressions, etc., is called the subsidiary of protecting training places."

Q: "Regarding those 250 bhikṣu precepts, having briefly understood them and also having briefly seen their containment in four subsidiaries, among the three karmas now, which karmas are regulated?"
A: "The three of body and four of speech, combined as seven branches, complete the branches to form inherent precepts." Q: [continues...]

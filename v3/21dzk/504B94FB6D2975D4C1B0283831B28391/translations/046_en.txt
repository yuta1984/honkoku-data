Eight contemplate suchness. The inferential category conditions wisdom and eight contemplate wisdom.

Question: In the true seeing path there are uninterrupted paths and liberation paths. In uninterrupted paths there are seeing aspects and self-witnessing aspects. What does the wisdom of the resembling seeing path model itself after? Answer: Dharma-forbearance models itself after the seeing aspect of the true uninterrupted path. Dharma-cognition models itself after the seeing aspect of the true liberation path. Inferential-forbearance models itself after the self-witnessing aspect in the uninterrupted path. Inferential-cognition models itself after the self-witnessing aspect in the liberation path.

Similarly for the upper and lower truths, contemplating ten types of minds—what are their characteristics? Answer: The desire realm is considered as one, and the upper two realms as one. Contemplating the lower four truths has eight minds, contemplating the upper four truths has eight minds, therefore it is called the upper-lower eight truths sixteen minds.

Question: What are the eight minds in the lower realm? Answer: Contemplating the four truth objects, each has two minds: first is direct contemplation forbearance, second is direct contemplation wisdom. Each truth has two, so two times four equals eight. The upper two realms are similar. Entry into the noble stage is difficult to investigate in detail; one cannot obtain the detailed textual explanations from the treatises. The commentaries are similarly unclear, but can be understood through observation.

Question: What is the extensive propagation of sacred teaching seeing path? Answer: Without arising characteristics, there are only twenty-six. Establishing calm and insight separately, insight as eight, calm as one, there are nine minds. However, this extensively surveys the doctrinal principles taught by all buddhas of the ten directions and three realms, knowing the principles and explaining them for others. Details are as in the treatises.

Question: What are the characteristics of the first fourth cultivation stage? Answer: The root verse of Consciousness-Only states: "No attainment and inconceivable, this is supramundane wisdom. Because one abandons the two coarsenesses, one thereby realizes and attains transformation of the basis." After bodhisattvas arise from the previous seeing path, in order to sever remaining obstacles and realize transformation of the basis, they repeatedly cultivate non-discriminating wisdom. Because they are distant from grasped objects and grasping subjects,

it is called no-attainment and inconceivable. Because they sever the mundane, it is called supramundane.

Question: What constitutes mundane and what constitutes supramundane? Answer: The seeds (latent tendencies) of dual-grasping are the root of the mundane. Only this can be severed, therefore the name "transcendent" is established.

Question: What are the two coarsenesses? Answer: The seeds of the two obstacles of afflictive and cognitive obstructions are called coarsenesses.

Question: Why are they called coarsenesses? Answer: First, their nature lacks capability; second, they oppose fineness and lightness. Because the seeds of the two obstacles have these two qualities, they are called coarsenesses. In the ten ground stages, one causes their permanent extinction, therefore they are abandoned here.

Question: What is transformation of the basis, and how is it realized? Answer: In the ten grounds, one cultivates the ten excellent practices, severs the ten serious obstacles, and realizes the ten suchnesses. The two types of transformation of the basis are thereby realized.

Question: What are the ten grounds referred to in the ten grounds? Answer: First is the Ground of Extreme Joy. Because one first attains noble nature, fully realizes the two emptinesses, can benefit self and others, and generates great joy, it is called Extreme Joy. Second is the Ground Free from Defilement. Because one possesses pure moral conduct and is distant from the afflictive defilements that can cause subtle transgressions, it is called Free from Defilement. Third is the Luminous Ground. Because one achieves excellent samādhi and great dharma retention, and can emit boundless wonderful wisdom light, it is called Luminous. Fourth is the Blazing Wisdom Ground. Because one abides peacefully in the supreme factors of awakening, burns the firewood of afflictions, and wisdom flames increase, it is called Blazing Wisdom. Fifth is the Extremely Difficult to Conquer Ground. Because the characteristics of the two wisdoms of conventional and ultimate are mutually contradictory, making them correspond is extremely difficult to conquer, therefore it is called Difficult to Conquer. Sixth is the Manifest Ground. Because one abides in dependent origination wisdom and draws forth non-discriminating supreme prajñā, causing it to manifest, it is called Manifest. Seventh is the Far-Going Ground. Because one reaches the final edge of effortful abiding in the signless and transcends the mundane and Two Vehicle paths, it is called Far-Going.

**Upper Section:**
Eighth is the Immovable Ground. Because non-discriminating wisdom continues spontaneously and cannot be disturbed by characteristic-utilizing afflictions, it is called Immovable. Ninth is the Good Wisdom Ground. Because one achieves the subtle four unobstructed analytical knowledges and can pervade the ten directions, excellently teaching the Dharma, it is called Good Wisdom. Tenth is the Dharma Cloud Ground. Because the great dharma wisdom cloud contains the water of numerous virtues, obscures space-like coarsenesses, and fills the Dharma body, it is called Dharma Cloud.

Question: What do these ten grounds take as their essence? Answer: They comprehensively include conditioned and unconditioned merits as their self-nature.

Question: Why are they called grounds? Answer: For the practices being cultivated, they serve as excellent support and foundation, enabling growth and development, therefore they are called grounds.

Question: What are the ten excellent practices? Answer: These are the ten types of pāramitās.

Question: What are the ten pāramitās? Answer: First is giving, which has three types: material giving, fearlessness giving, and Dharma giving. Second is moral conduct, which has three types: disciplinary precepts, precepts for gathering wholesome dharmas, and precepts for benefiting sentient beings. Third is patience, which has three types: patience with enmity and harm, patience in accepting suffering, and patience in examining dharmas. Fourth is vigor, which has three types: armor-like vigor, vigor in gathering wholesome practices, and vigor for benefiting others. Fifth is meditative concentration, which has three types: abiding meditative concentration, arousing meditative concentration, and accomplishing tasks meditative concentration. Sixth is wisdom, which has three types: wisdom of non-discriminating emptiness of persons, wisdom of non-discriminating emptiness of dharmas, and wisdom of non-discriminating emptiness of both.

Ninth is powers, which have two types: power of analytical thinking and power of cultivation.

**Lower Section:**
Tenth is knowledge, which has two types: knowledge enjoying Dharma bliss and knowledge accomplishing sentient beings.

Question: What do these ten practices take as their nature? Answer: Giving takes non-greed and the three actions arising from it as its nature. Moral conduct takes the three actions when receiving and learning bodhisattva precepts as its nature. Patience takes non-hatred, vigor, analytical wisdom, and the three actions arising from them as its nature. Vigor takes diligence and the three actions arising from it as its nature. Meditative concentration solely takes equipoise as its nature. The latter five all take analytical discrimination as their nature, because they are said to be fundamental and subsequently attained wisdom.

Question: What is the meaning of pāramitā? Answer: Pāramitā means "reaching the other shore." Because it enables practitioners to reach nirvana. If what is cultivated and attained is included in the seven supremacies, there are pāramitās.

Question: What are the seven supremacies? Answer: First is the supremacy of abiding, meaning necessarily abiding in the bodhisattva lineage. Second is the supremacy of foundation, meaning necessarily depending on the great bodhi mind. Third is the supremacy of aspiration, meaning necessarily having compassion for all sentient beings. Fourth is the supremacy of undertaking, meaning necessarily engaging in all undertakings. Fifth is the supremacy of skillful means, meaning necessarily being embraced by signless wisdom. Sixth is the supremacy of dedication, necessarily dedicating to unsurpassed bodhi. Seventh is the supremacy of purity, meaning necessarily not being mixed with the two obstacles. If one is not embraced by these seven, the giving and so forth that one practices are not "reaching the other shore."

Question: Why are giving and so forth necessarily only ten without increase or decrease? Answer: In the ten grounds, counteracting the ten obstacles and realizing the ten suchnesses, there is no increase or decrease.

Question: Among the ten excellent practices, why do the first six each have three types while the latter four only have

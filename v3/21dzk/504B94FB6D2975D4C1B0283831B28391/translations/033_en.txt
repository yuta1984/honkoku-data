**Mahāyāna Yogācāra Research and Investigation Chapter, Volume 4**

**Right Page Upper Section:**
**Answer:** "True" has two meanings: 1) Ultimate meaning is called "true"; 2) The supreme meaning of Mahāyāna is called "true."

**Question:** Among these two meanings of "true," which one is taken as "true-therefore"? **Answer:** Both meanings are used together as "true."

**Question:** Why are both truths used together to be called "true"? **Answer:** There are two types of worldly [understanding]: 1) scholarly worldly understanding; 2) non-scholarly worldly understanding. To distinguish contradictions against these two worldly [understandings], the two truths are employed.

**Question:** Are these two worldly [understandings] one person or two persons? **Answer:** Only the opponent - one person becomes two. It is not two persons.

The text explains that one person can have two types of intelligence: 1) intelligence through learning (acquired through teacher's instruction about the five aggregates, twelve sense-fields, eighteen elements, three natures, consciousness-only, two truths, four truths); 2) intelligence following worldly convention (natural knowledge about family, food, etc., acquired through social circulation rather than formal learning).

The discussion then moves to the **Two Truths doctrine**:

**Lower Section:**
The **Four Types of Conventional Truth:**
1. **Worldly Conventional Truth** (also called "Having Name but No Reality Truth")
2. **Logical Conventional Truth** (also called "Following Phenomena and Distinctions Truth")  
3. **Attainment Conventional Truth** (also called "Expedient Establishment Truth")
4. **Ultimate Conventional Truth** (also called "Nominal Non-Establishment Truth")

The **Four Types of Ultimate Truth:**
1. **Worldly Ultimate Truth** (also called "Substance and Function Manifestation Truth")
2. **Logical Ultimate Truth** (also called "Cause and Effect Distinction Truth")
3. **Attainment Ultimate Truth** (also called "Relying on Gates to Reveal Reality Truth")
4. **Ultimate Ultimate Truth** (also called "Abandoning Words to Discuss Essence Truth")

The text explains the etymology: "Worldly" means concealment and destructibility; "conventional" means manifestation and following worldly flow.

**Upper Section:**
The text continues explaining the **Four Ultimate Truths:** the first three involve "boundary meaning" while the fourth involves "logical meaning."

It then details what each type encompasses:
- **First Conventional:** Names without reality (like jar, army, forest, self, sentient beings)
- **Second-Fourth Conventional:** Various levels of established phenomena
- **Four Ultimate Truths:** From the three categories of dharmas up to the one true dharma-realm

**Lower Section:**
The text discusses the **Two Truths according to Persons vs. Dharmas:**

**According to Persons:**
- Lower intelligence (ordinary people): doesn't know truth
- Middle intelligence (Two Vehicle practitioners): knows truth partially  
- Superior intelligence (Bodhisattvas): knows truth fully

**According to Dharmas:**
The text systematically explains how the same phenomena can be categorized as either conventional or ultimate truth depending on the level of analysis.

The page concludes by citing the **Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra** and **Kuiji's commentary** as textual evidence for this **four-fold classification of each truth**.

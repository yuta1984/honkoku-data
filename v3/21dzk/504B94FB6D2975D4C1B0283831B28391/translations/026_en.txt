**Chapter 3 of the Mahāyāna Yogācāra Research Divine Text**

**Upper Section**
If one raises the conditioned spoken of by true nature, then it is without substance. If the cause lacks foundation, then it is the fault of unfounded causation. Regarding the analogy of illusion, when asked whether it is conditioned or unconditioned, the answer is "it is ultimately non-existent."

Q: "If so, the first volume of the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra says 'Though all are truly non-existent, they appear as if existing.' Since it already says 'seemingly existent,' how does the emptiness school succeed? This is the fault of unestablished thesis regarding the analogy."

Q: "Regarding the conditioned mentioned in the thesis, do you raise Dharmapāla's conditioned or your school's conditioned?"
A: "I only raise the conditioned that Dharmapāla explains."

Q: "If so, regarding Dharmapāla's school's conditioned—this is what you do not accept. Dharmapāla's conditioned is neither empty nor non-empty regarding the two truths of ultimate and conventional, but you completely do not accept this. This is the fault of unestablished qualified subject. Your school's conditioned is immediately empty regarding the ultimate—how is it existent regarding the conventional? Raising what you yourself do not accept, what qualified subject is there?"

According to the Prajñāpāramitā text, creating dharma-characteristic contradiction: "True nature conditioned exists (thesis), because it arises from conditions (reason), like illusion (analogy)." If following the Prajñāpāramitā, that treatise verse should say "True nature conditioned exists, like illusion, because of dependent arising."

The Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra volume 4 quotes the Guṇastrī-sūtra. In that sūtra text, the Buddha asks Guṇastrī: "Does illusion exist?" Guṇastrī answers: "No, World-Honored One, illusion is not existence." The Buddha asks again: "If so, is illusion non-existence?" Guṇastrī answers: "No, World-Honored One, illusion is not non-existence." The Buddha asks again: "If so, is illusion seen?" Guṇastrī answers: "Illusion is seen by the eye." According to this sūtra text, illusion is neither existent nor non-existent. Since there are dissimilar instances, how can it be a positive analogy? This is the fault of unestablished thesis. Illusion is apart from existence

**Lower Section**
and non-existence, being neither existent nor empty. In relation to the uniformly empty school, illusion becomes a dissimilar instance to the thesis.

Or Master Bhāvaviveka violates what the Buddha taught. The Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra states: "Relying on all dharmas being without inherent nature, unborn and unceasing, originally tranquil, of nirvāṇa nature, naturelessness nature, [the Buddha] turns the wheel of true Dharma. This is extremely rare, supreme and unexcelled, this is truly definitive meaning." The meaning shown is that when the Prajñāpāramitā-sūtra teaches dharmas as without inherent nature, it makes this teaching relying on the three naturelessnesses, not based on dependent nature and perfected reality. Because the three natures are all imagined [constructions], it teaches naturelessness relying on imagined nature, not meaning that the two natures are all without inherent nature.

However, Bhāvaviveka teaches that the substantial nature of dependent arising is completely non-existent. Since this violates the Buddha's teaching, it becomes great wrong view. Because it diverges from the Buddha's teaching, it becomes wrong view. If the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra's words are not the Buddha's teaching, then an answer can barely be made. If one accepts it as the Buddha's teaching, no answer can be obtained.

**Tiantai School**

Q: "What is that school?"
A: "It takes Mahāyāna calm-abiding and insight as its doctrinal essence."

Q: "What is called 'calm-abiding' and what is 'insight'?"
A: "There are two types of calm-abiding: first, stopping downward; second, stopping and dwelling. This stopping and dwelling is made the school of cultivation practice, called calm-abiding. Wisdom is called insight."

Q: "Calm-abiding is stopping and dwelling, which is samādhi. Why is samādhi called calm-abiding?"
A: "Because it stops the mind in one object and prevents scattering, it is called calm-abiding."

Q: "There are three types of this: first, samādhi; second, samāpatti; third, samāpatti. What is called calm-abiding?"
A: "What is close to samādhi is called calm-abiding. The other two can be thus as well."

Q: "If so, is that calm-abiding only for concentration, or does it also extend to distraction?"
A: "Scattered samādhi calm-abiding extends to both concentration and distraction. Because it is samādhi that stops the mind in one object."

**Upper Section**
Q: "Insight is wisdom. Within the expedient and fundamental practices of the śrāvaka vehicle, within expedient practices there are three types of contemplation: first, five stopping-mind contemplations; second, distinctive characteristic foundations of mindfulness contemplation; third, general characteristic foundations of mindfulness contemplation. What contemplation among the three is the contemplation now spoken of? Within preparatory contemplations there are heat, summit, forbearance, and supreme worldly dharma. Śrāvaka vehicle people rely on selflessness contemplation to contemplate the aggregates, sense-fields, and elements. Pratyekabuddha vehicle people rely on selflessness contemplation, having seventy-seven wisdom contemplations and forty-four wisdom contemplations. In the fundamental stage there is the sixteen-aspect contemplation of the four noble truths principle. What contemplation is the contemplation now spoken of? For bodhisattva contemplations: three natures and three naturelessnesses contemplation, grasper and grasped contemplation, the various contemplations of the ten dwellings, ten practices, and ten dedications, ten suchness contemplations, seven suchness contemplations. At the Buddha's fruition stage: three foundations of mindfulness, four types of all-species wonderful wisdom contemplations, three non-protections, etc. What contemplation is called contemplation?"

Q: "Regarding samādhi, samāpatti, and samāpatti contemplations—how is it that there is meaning within calm-abiding?"

Q: "There are eight liberations, eight masteries, and ten total-field contemplations. What is called contemplation? All such matters are what Masters Enshō Gishin and others of Mt. Hiei Enryaku-ji completely know."

Q: "The Yogācāra-śāstra teaches there are calm-abiding, lifting, and equanimity. Practitioners of the three vehicles through this cultivation obtain their vehicle's fruits. Why only teach calm-abiding and insight without teaching equanimity?"
A: "Calm-abiding is concentration. Insight is the wisdom mental factor within calm-abiding. The two of lifting and equanimity are briefly not clarified. In principle they should be clearly explained."

Q: "If so, lifting and equanimity should also be clearly explained. What is called lifting and what is called equanimity?"
A: "When practitioners

**Lower Section**
dwell in calm-abiding and the concentrated mind stops down, then they cultivate lifting. Lifting means reading sūtras in a loud voice, prostrating to buddhas, walking meditation and other such practices. Such practices are called lifting. If the mind becomes scattered, one again dwells in calm-abiding. When the mind is weak, one immediately dwells in equanimity. Equanimity means only being without thought and giving rest to the mind's weakness. As practitioners thus achieve perfect causes and complete fruits, calm-abiding, lifting, and equanimity are what practitioners study."

Q: "Tiantai masters and others establish four vehicles. How are the goat, deer, and ox carts made into four?"
A: "Because the ox cart is divided in two, there are four carts."

Q: "Why divide into two?"
A: "What is taught together with goat and deer as having three is the same as goat and deer being provisional. The open ground and cart are different from those three, so they make four."

Q: "Why are goat and deer taught together, with the ox cart not being a real cart?"
A: "Only because like the two carts, there are only words."

Q: "If two are non-existent and one exists, combining them as three carts—what impediment is there? Why together two? What is accepted must be same two provisional. For example, there is a person with three young children, holding one pear in hand, with no other objects whatsoever. Calling the three children: 'You quickly come out. I will tell you of three, giving to each respectively.' The three children compete to come. The father then speaks: 'That there are three objects—this is my expedient means. There is only one pear,' immediately dividing it into three parts and giving. The Buddha is also thus. Having only the ox cart, he immediately tells the children: 'There are goat, deer, and ox. You all quickly exit the burning house of the three realms. With these three carts, each one is given.' When the children come out, he immediately speaks: 'There is only one cart. Two are my expedient means,' dividing the one ox cart and equally giving to the children. Such analogies are not absent from the world. How then does one calculate this?"

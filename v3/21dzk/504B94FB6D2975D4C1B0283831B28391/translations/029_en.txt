**Chapter 3 of the Mahāyāna Yogācāra Research Divine Text**

**Upper Section**
"Abhi" means "toward" or "corresponding." "Dharma" means "law" or "doctrine." "Kośa" means "treasury." "Śāstra" means "treatise." Combined, it is called the "Abhidharmakośa-śāstra" (Treasury of Abhidharma Treatise).

Q: "Since the arising of dharma has causes, what is the reason for this treatise's composition?"

A: "The author of this treatise, Bodhisattva Vasubandhu, was the son of a court Brahmin in Gandhāra kingdom in northern India. He renounced and entered the path within the Sarvāstivāda school. He consequently received and maintained that school's Tripiṭaka. Later he studied the Sautrāntika school and in his heart considered it true. Regarding the Sarvāstivāda doctrine he had originally studied, he sometimes harbored thoughts of acceptance and rejection. He then wished to go to Kashmir kingdom to investigate the Abhidharma school and determine what was right and wrong. Knowing that those teachers would harbor suspicion and wariness, he changed his original name and secretly went to investigate. After four years, he repeatedly used Sautrāntika doctrine to refute the Abhidharma school. At that time there was an arhat named Saṃghabhadra, which in Chinese means 'Awakened Entry.' Finding his divine abilities strange, he entered meditation to observe and came to know it was Vasubandhu. He secretly warned: 'Quickly return to your home country. An elder monk has come and repeatedly uses Sautrāntika doctrine to refute our school. However, among this assembly, those who have not yet abandoned desire are not few but many. If they know you are Vasubandhu, they may harm you.' Due to this he returned to his home country. Not long after, he composed the six hundred verses of the Abhidharmakośa and sent them to Kashmir through his disciples. When the king and great assembly of that country heard this, they were all delighted. They decorated banners and flags, and came out of the country to welcome with flowers, incense, and music. They mounted the verses on a fragrant elephant, led in procession front and back, and upon reaching the country, they read and praised it. All said it could propagate their school, and none was not joyful. At that time Awakened Entry told the assembly: 'This does not exclusively propagate your

school. Why should you rejoice? The verses contain expressions of hearsay that seem like mocking words. If you don't believe it, request a commentary and you will know for yourself.' At this time the king and assembly of monks sent envoys with a request for commentary, also offering precious pearls. The treatise author accepted the request and composed a commentary on the original verses—altogether eight thousand verses of commentary. When sent back to Kashmir, it was indeed as Awakened Entry had said. The treatise author's intention was to clarify Sautrāntika doctrine. Therefore in this treatise's verses one frequently hears expressions like 'according to tradition.'"

Q: "Why is saying 'according to tradition' called 'mocking'?"

A: "To show it was not personally heard, he used expressions of hearsay. Therefore it seems like mocking. This is precisely the origin of this treatise."

Q: "In composing treatises in the West, all interpret Buddhist sūtras. Buddhist teachings are extremely numerous—which Buddhist sūtra does this interpret?"

A: "Though Buddhist sūtras are numerous, they conform to the three dharma seals. The intention of this treatise is to interpret 'all dharmas are without self.' Though raising one interpretation, it clarifies the three seals."

Q: "What are those three dharma seals?"

A: "The three dharma seals are: first, all conditioned things are impermanent; second, all dharmas are without self; third, nirvāṇa is tranquil. The dharma taught by the Buddha is sealed by these three. If not sealed by them, all are heterodox teachings, not Buddha's teaching."

Q: "If so, there are three seals—why does this treatise only interpret 'all dharmas are without self'?"

A: "Among Buddhist teachings, some sūtras explain one, some explain two, some explain the three dharma seals. The various treatise masters have different inclinations. Some exclusively interpret one dharma seal, some raise one seal to clarify the three seals. This treatise raises one to clarify three."

Q: "Which treatises interpret one dharma seal?"

A: "The Pañcaskandha-śāstra only interprets one seal—namely, all conditioned things are impermanent. The Nirvāṇa-śāstra also interprets one seal—namely, nirvāṇa is tranquil."

Q: "Why does this treatise exclusively interpret the one 'all

dharmas are without self'?"

A: "'All conditioned things are impermanent' only clarifies the conditioned. 'Nirvāṇa is tranquil' only clarifies the unconditioned. 'All dharmas are without self' encompasses both conditioned and unconditioned. This treatise wishes to manifest that nothing is not included, so it clarifies extensively."

Q: "Since this treatise already clarifies the principle of no-self, why is the first chapter called the 'Chapter on Elements'?"

A: "Dharma has phenomena and principle. Phenomena are shallow and coarse, so elements are clarified first. Principle is subtle and deep, so it is clarified later."

Q: "How many dharma categories does this treatise comprehensively explain?"

A: "There are seventy-five dharma categories in total. What constitutes the seventy-five?"

A: "Namely: form, mind, mental factors, non-associated, and unconditioned. Among forms there are eleven. Mind dharmas briefly have one—namely, one mind-king only. Mental factors are forty-six, non-associated are fourteen, unconditioned are only three. These are called the seventy-five."

Q: "In what doctrines does this treatise differ from the Mahāyāna?"

A: "Briefly there are nineteen doctrines. First, conditioned dharma essence eternally exists. Second, conditioned and unconditioned dharmas really exist. Third, among all dharmas, what exists is ultimate, what doesn't exist is conventional. Fourth, atoms combine to form coarse matter. Fifth, atoms and coarse matter are both really existent. Sixth, six causes obtain four fruits. Seventh, unconditioned dharmas have no cause and effect. Eighth, there is non-defiled ignorance with wisdom as essence. Ninth, among the four characteristics, the arising characteristic is in the future, the three of duration, change, and cessation are in the present. Tenth, past and future atoms dwell scattered in space, present atoms combine to form coarse matter. Eleventh, the six consciousness realms arise simultaneously. Twelfth, unconditioned

are only three. Thirteenth, among the four fruits, stream-entry does not regress, the latter three fruits have regression. Fourteenth, the indeterminate have eight. Fifteenth, the path of seeing has sixteen moments. The sixteenth moment is in the path of cultivation. Sixteenth, the four characteristics and acquisition all have great and small. Seventeenth, cessation concentration is contaminated dharma. Eighteenth, initial and sustained application arise together. Nineteenth, non-associated have fourteen. Such different doctrines are numerous, not just one. Nineteen are briefly indicated. Other separate doctrinal principles should be investigated and understood by later students.

Now, regarding the first doctrine, why does conditioned essence eternally exist?"

A: "The essence is permanent, but its function is impermanent. Otherwise, what difference would there be between essence and function? All students: in this doctrine there are said to be two transmissions. One: dharma essence undergoes birth and death yet eternally exists. Two: dharma essence has no birth or death, eternally existing. Such false transmissions flow abundantly in the latter age. This is the most lamentable of lamentations. How severe is the decline of Buddha-dharma! Now I relate what I originally heard, though it need not necessarily be used. Conditioned dharma essence has no birth or death, eternally abiding without cessation. This is the original doctrine. When the age reached the semblance and final periods, people lost the doctrinal foundation—how can one not lament?

In the first chapter on elements of the Abhidharmakośa, clarifying the twelve sense bases, it states: 'Mind and mental dharmas, the meaning of gates of growth and development is the meaning of sense base.' In explanatory terms: 'Because they can give rise to and develop mind and mental dharmas, they are called sense bases—this is the meaning of being able to give rise to and develop those functions.' Master Guang's commentary, fascicle two, states: 'Mind and mental dharmas up to the meaning of those functions—this explains the meaning of sense base. The meaning of gates for mind's growth and development is the meaning of sense base. Those twelve kinds can give rise to and develop mind and so forth, hence are called sense bases. Dharma essence already exists beforehand—one cannot speak of birth. They can only give rise to and develop the meaning of those functions.' (Above is commentary text.) Since it states 'dharma essence already exists beforehand, one cannot speak of birth,' how could there be birth and death? One could also say 'dharma essence already exists beforehand, one cannot speak of cessation.' Therefore, saying dharma essence has birth and death is extreme foolishness.

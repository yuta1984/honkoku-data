Question: What constitutes the peak? Answer: Because investigation reaches its extreme, it is called peak. To reveal the meaning: bodhisattvas of this stage attain the bright-increasing samādhi. Depending on this samādhi power, they arouse superior investigation and repeatedly contemplate the non-existence of grasped objects. Because it is the peak of investigation, the name peak is established. Because the bright characteristics intensify, that samādhi is called bright-increasing. Because the stage of investigation reaches its extreme, that stage is solely peak.

Question: What is called patience? Answer: Regarding the non-existence of grasped objects, one decisively seals and maintains this understanding, and regarding the non-existence of the grasping subject, one also accords with and joyfully endures.

Question: What constitutes the highest worldly dharma? Answer: Among the dharmas of the ordinary being stage, this is supreme, therefore it is called the highest worldly dharma. Bodhisattvas of this stage depend on the uninterrupted samādhi. Depending on this samādhi power, they arouse superior accurate cognition. They seal the emptiness of dual-grasping and jointly seal the emptiness characteristics, but because all still carry characteristics, they cannot yet realize the truth.

Question: Regarding attaining the four samādhis in these four wholesome root stages, the meaning is not yet clear—what are their characteristics? Answer: First, in the warmth stage, one attains the bright-attainment samādhi. Because one depends on samādhi power, one arouses inferior investigation. Depending on this investigation, one contemplates the non-existence of grasped objects—namely the four of name, meaning, self-nature, and distinction. These four dharmas are solely transformations of one's own mind, provisionally established as existent, but actually unobtainable. Therefore one contemplates their complete non-existence.

Question: Why is the attained samādhi called bright-attainment? Answer: Because one first attains the preceding characteristic of the sun of wisdom, it is called bright-attainment samādhi.

Question: Why is it called warmth? Answer: Because this has the preceding sign of fire, it is also called warmth.

Question: Regarding the meaning of bright-increasing samādhi, what are its characteristics? Answer: Next, in the peak stage, one attains bright-increasing samādhi. Because one depends on samādhi power, one arouses superior investigation and contemplates the non-existence of grasped objects.

Question: Regarding the meaning of seal-according samādhi, what are its characteristics? Answer: Next, in the patience stage, one attains seal-according samādhi. Because one depends on samādhi power, one arouses inferior accurate cognition. In the non-existence of grasped objects, one decisively seals and maintains this understanding. In the non-existence of grasping subjects, one also accords with and joyfully endures. Since there is already no real object, how could there be real consciousness separate from the grasping consciousness? Separate from grasped objects, grasped objects and grasping subjects are established through mutual dependence, so one seals the former and accords with the latter. Therefore it is called seal-according. Because one endures the emptiness of objects and consciousness, it is also called patience.

Question: Regarding the meaning of uninterrupted samādhi, what are its characteristics? Answer: In the highest worldly dharma stage, one attains uninterrupted samādhi. Because one depends on samādhi power, one arouses superior accurate cognition and seals the emptiness characteristics of dual-grasping. From this point without interruption, one necessarily enters the seeing path. Therefore it is called uninterrupted. Among ordinary being dharmas, this is supreme, therefore it is called highest worldly [dharma].

Question: What are the characteristics of the first third penetration stage? Answer: The root verse of Consciousness-Only states: "When regarding objects of cognition, wisdom has absolutely no attainment, at that time one dwells in consciousness-only, because one is free from the characteristics of dual-grasping." When a bodhisattva, regarding the objects of cognition, through non-discriminating wisdom has absolutely no attainment and does not grasp various conceptual elaboration characteristics, at that time one is truly said to dwell in the consciousness-only true ultimate nature.

Question: Why is this stage called the penetration stage? Answer: When this wisdom arises uninterruptedly after the preparatory practices, experiencing and meeting suchness, it is called the penetration stage.

Question: Why is it sometimes called the seeing path stage? Answer: Because one first illuminates principle, it is also called the seeing path.

Question: What are called the sixteen types of grasped-grasping minds? Answer: Namely, regarding the truth of suffering, there are four types of mind: first is the forbearance of dharma-cognition of suffering, second is the dharma-cognition of suffering, third is the forbearance of inferential cognition of suffering, fourth is the inferential cognition of suffering. On each of the four truths, there are four types each, making four times four—sixteen types of mind.

Question: What are the eight in those [realms]? Answer: Contemplating the four truths of the desire realm, each having two minds: direct contemplation forbearance and direct contemplation wisdom. Contemplating one truth of suffering has two minds. Each of the four truths has two, combining to make eight minds.

Therefore they are called the grasped-grasping sixteen minds.

Question: Among the sixteen minds, which eight contemplate suchness and which eight contemplate wisdom? Answer: The dharma category conditions suchness and exists

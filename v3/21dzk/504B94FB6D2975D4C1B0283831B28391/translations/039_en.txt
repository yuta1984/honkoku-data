**Upper Section:**
They do not harm others, when they commit evil they quickly repent, constantly practice loving-kindness, know gratitude and repay kindness. Whatever they know and seek, they do not [obtain] through non-Dharma [means]. They constantly cultivate merit-producing karma, fear even light transgressions heavily, when they see or hear others suffering, [they feel it] more than their own suffering. They enjoy sharing in good deeds and delight in staying away from evil deeds. Even toward servants, they speak no harsh words, and toward those with virtue, [recognizing] they have virtue, they constantly arrive at praise and reverence. These are the **characteristics of śīla pāramitā spiritual lineage**.

If they are harmed by others, they have **no mind of retaliation**; if others do not apologize with remonstrance, they can quickly accept [this]; they never **hold grudges** and do not **harbor resentment for long**. These are the **characteristics of kṣānti pāramitā spiritual lineage**.

If by nature they are **diligent themselves**, **rising early and sleeping late**, not deeply indulging in **sleep and comfort**, toward tasks to be done they courageously and decisively enjoy acting, not **generating laziness**. They **consider expedient means** and essentially **ensure completion**. Regarding **great principles** they are **fearless** and **do not belittle themselves**. These are the **characteristics of vīrya pāramitā spiritual lineage**.

If regarding **Dharma principles**, by nature they **carefully contemplate**, **enjoy tranquility**, **love and long for liberation**, in what they do there is **no forgetfulness**, and toward **enemies [they show] compassion**. These are the **characteristics of dhyāna pāramitā spiritual lineage**.

If by nature they **possess wisdom**, though easily damaged, within **departing from evil affairs** they have **powerful discriminative thought**, by nature they **cannot commit ānantarya karma** or **sever wholesome [roots] and their karmic results**, etc. Even if **born in evil destinies**, they can **quickly escape**, and also do not **receive intense great suffering**. These are the **characteristics of prajñā pāramitā spiritual lineage**.

If one sees **having such coarse characteristics of dāna** etc., **hindrances and entanglements are light and slight**, **gross [obstructions] are thin and weak**, one **definitely knows** there is **bodhisattva original nature**.

**Question:** Such **bodhisattvas who possess the spiritual lineages of the Six Perfections**—since they are **ordinary beings** who have **not yet aroused [bodhicitta]**, who have **not yet cultivated practice**, if they **create evil karma**, do they **fall into evil destinies**? If they **create wholesome karma**, do they **revolve in saṃsāra**?

**Answer:** Such things occur.

**Question:** **Bodhisattva spiritual lineage** has **supreme power**. Why is this so?

**Answer:** Although they **possess spiritual lineage**, since they have

**Lower Section:**
**not yet encountered true good spiritual friends** who **explain bodhi** to them, even if they **do encounter** [them], it may be **incorrect teaching and transmission**, or their **learning is slow and lax**, **wholesome roots are not yet mature**, so they necessarily **revolve in birth [and death]**. If they are **creators of evil**, they also **fall into evil destinies**. However, although they **revolve**, they **quickly develop disgust and renunciation**; even if they **fall into evil destinies**, they **quickly obtain freedom and escape**. [This is] **because their spiritual lineage is superior**.

**Question:** We already **know the coarse characteristics**. How does the **actual spiritual lineage essence** exist?

**Answer:** There are **two kinds**: **First, naturally abiding spiritual lineage**; **Second, spiritual lineage accomplished through habituation**. **Naturally abiding spiritual lineage** means that **bodhisattvas** have **six sense-spheres that are excellent**, **having such characteristics**, **from beginningless** [time], **transmitted in succession**, **obtained naturally**—this is called **naturally abiding spiritual lineage**. **Spiritual lineage accomplished through habituation** means what **arises from previously habituated wholesome roots**—this is called **spiritual lineage accomplished through habituation**. The **meaning here** **takes both types**.

**Question:** **People with spiritual lineage** have **such two types of spiritual lineage**—this is already clearly known. How is **that spiritual lineage nature** known?

**Answer:** There are **three interpretations in the West**. **Master Śūramati** says: There is **no separate spiritual lineage**, but **within their bodies**, the **seeds of the two obstructions** have **the characteristic of being eliminable**. **Because of this characteristic**, we say they **have spiritual lineage**. Namely, **at whatever time** they **encounter good spiritual friends**, **hear the Dharma and arouse [bodhicitta]**, **seek great bodhi**. **Before the [first] stage** through **perfuming accomplishment** there are **four [types of] hearing-perfuming**: **First, merit-portion wholesome roots**; **Second, perfumed contaminated wholesome [dharmas]**; **Third, path-portion wholesome roots**; **Fourth, perfumed uncontaminated wholesome roots**. The **fourth wholesome roots** are called **habituated spiritual lineage**.

**Master Candrapāla** says: **Originally existing uncontaminated naturally-occurring seeds** are called **naturally abiding spiritual lineage**. When they **reach the ten faiths**, **hear the Dharma and arouse [bodhicitta]**, **depending on the manifesting mind**, they **nourish and activate the original nature**, **causing it to increase and excel**—this is called **spiritual lineage accomplished through habituation**. **At any time**, they **no longer undergo new perfuming**; regarding **one old type**, through **meaning** it is **divided into two**.

**Master Dharmapāla** says: Although the **previous ones are subjected to contaminated hearing-perfuming**,

**Left Page**

**Upper Section:**
they **nourish the original seeds**, but **these are types of originally existing [seeds]**. Therefore they **generally belong to original seeds**. Thus **before the [first] stage** there are **no uncontaminated habituated nature seed-essences**, but **arising only from nature-seeds**, they become the **non-discriminating wisdom of the initial mind of the first stage**. When **this wisdom arises**, it **immediately perfumes and accomplishes seeds**—this is the **uncontaminated habituated spiritual lineage essence**. If we **discuss contaminated habituated spiritual lineage**, there is also [such] **before the [first] stage**.

**Question:** What is the meaning of **"six sense-spheres excellent,"** etc.?

**Answer:** The **six faculties of eye** etc. serve as the **six sense-spheres**. **Ālayavijñāna** is **in that mental sense-sphere**. Among these **six sense-spheres**, [it] is **most excellent**. In this **excellent sphere**, there is **this spiritual lineage**.

**Question:** Why do we say **"transmitted in succession"**?

**Answer:** That **spiritual lineage essence** is **conditioned dharma**, **depending on ālayavijñāna**, it **continues in succession**. Therefore we say **"transmitted"**.

**Question:** Why is it called **"obtained naturally"**?

**Answer:** **Not through perfuming**, but **existing originally**, therefore we say **"naturally"**.

**Question:** We have already **revealed the forms possessed by no-nature**, but in **sutras and treatises** there is [mention of] **"all [beings] becoming Buddha"**—what is the meaning of this?

**Answer:** The **Nirvāṇa Sūtra**, volume 35, states: **"All have Buddha-nature"** and **"All lack Buddha-nature"**—both **do not grasp my meaning**. **"All sentient beings all have Buddha-nature and attain Buddhahood"**—why does the Buddha say [they] **do not grasp my meaning**? Only when [one says] **"some have and some lack"** can one **grasp the Buddha's meaning**.

The **Nirvāṇa Sūtra**, old [version] 36, new [version] 32, states: Like in the **Ganges River** there are **seven [types of] sentient beings**: **First, constantly submerged**; **Second, emerging but returning and entering again**; **Third, emerging and then dwelling**; **Fourth, emerging and seeing the four directions**; **Fifth, seeing everywhere and then moving**; **Sixth, moving and then dwelling again**; **Seventh, moving on both water and land**. In the **Great Parinirvāṇa** there are **seven [types of] sentient beings**. The **first, constantly submerged**, the commentary explains: **Those dwelling in evil dharmas** are **people without spiritual lineage**. **Constantly in birth-and-death**, therefore called **"constantly submerged"**. If **all sentient beings**

**Lower Section:**
**all have Buddha-nature** and **all accomplish the Buddha Way**, why does the sutra speak of **"constantly submerged"**? If one says **"temporarily submerged"** and calls it **"constantly submerged"**, one could say **"temporarily submerged"**.

**Question:** Regarding such **seven people**, does **one person possess all seven**, or do **seven people each [have] one**?

**Answer:** **One person possesses all seven**. Or **seven people each [have] one**. However, among these **seven people**, the **first constantly submerged one** is **ultimately without nature**—**because of constant submersion**.

**Question:** **Nirvāṇa** 26, **Ratnaketu-rāja Chapter**, has **three types of sick people**: whether they **encounter a good physician** or **do not encounter a good physician**, they **definitely do not recover**. These are **people without nature**. These are **without nature**, **ultimately icchantika**. In the **Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṃkāra**, **Master Maitreya** calls them **ātyantikas**. This **reveals ultimate absence of nature**.

Also the **Nirvāṇa Sūtra** states: "**I once taught One Vehicle, one path, one practice, one condition**. **My disciples** **did not grasp my meaning** and **proclaimed as the Buddha's words**: '**All śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, etc., all accomplish Buddhahood**.' **Two Vehicle people** all **accomplish Buddha-fruit**, yet why does the Buddha say they **'do not grasp my meaning'**?" Therefore, **indeterminate lineage people among the Two Vehicles** **definitely accomplish Buddhahood**; **determinate lineage Two Vehicle [practitioners]** **do not accomplish Buddhahood at all**. The statement **"I once taught One Vehicle, one path, one practice, one condition"** [refers to] the **Lotus Sūtra's** statement: "**In the Buddha-lands of the ten directions, there is only One Vehicle Dharma. There is neither two nor three**."

**Question:** Within **Buddhism**, **Mahāyāna** and **Hīnayāna** **teachings are each different**. Yet they are equally **within the inner Dharma**. How then are the **different ways of explaining and attaining Buddha-nature** [to be understood]?

**Answer:** The **Sarvāstivāda masters** **do not teach** the existence of **inherent Buddha-nature**; they **only teach** the existence of **cultivated Buddha-nature**. Namely, **approaching good spiritual friends**, **listening to correct Dharma**, **arousing bodhicitta**—**at that time** they **newly obtain Buddha spiritual lineage essence**. The **Vibhajyavādins** say: **Mind-nature is originally pure**, [but] is **defiled by adventitious defilements and afflictions**, therefore it is called **"mixed and defiled"**. When **separated from afflictions**, it **transforms into**...

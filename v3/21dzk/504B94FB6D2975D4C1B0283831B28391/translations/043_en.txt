**Upper Section:**
[Someone] arouses the mind [of enlightenment] and receives the bodhisattva precepts, but later regresses and falls into evil destinies. Why does such regression into evil destinies occur?

Answer: The Yogācāra treatise states there are four conditions that can cause bodhisattvas to regress from bodhicitta. First, lacking proper spiritual lineage; Second, being influenced by evil companions; Third, having weak compassion toward sentient beings; Fourth, developing fear and terror toward the great sufferings of extremely long-term saṃsāra.

Question: What kind of lacking spiritual lineage prevents initial arousal of bodhicitta? Answer: Some people without [bodhisattva] lineage, troubled by livelihood concerns, or people without lineage fearing royal constraints, or people without lineage following elders' words, or people without lineage following good friends, or people without lineage pressed by poverty, or people without lineage pressed by illness and suffering—through good spiritual guides they arouse bodhicitta, but due to lacking proper lineage, they ultimately regress.

Question: What are the remaining three conditions? Answer: Even those with proper lineage still regress due to [adverse] conditions.

Question: Does such mind-arousal have protection? Answer: Five hundred blue-robed great demon-spirit kings constantly provide protection, like shadows following the body. Through this, disasters depart and fortune arrives; those under such protection experience peace and well-being whether sleeping or awake.

Question: After arousing bodhicitta, what should one rely upon? Answer: Draw close to good spiritual friends.

Question: What constitutes drawing close? Answer: First seek good friends. When attempting to traverse dangerous paths, without guides there are no means.

Question: What are called good spiritual friends? Answer: Those who have matured the eight qualities can serve as good spiritual friends.

Question: What are the eight qualities? Answer: First, dwelling in precepts—dwelling in bodhisattva precepts without defects or violations. Second, extensive learning—accomplished in awakened wisdom. Third, having realization—attaining any supreme good from cultivation. Fourth, compassion—internally possessing loving-kindness and compassion. Fifth, fearlessness—when teaching

dharma to others, not [speaking] from念弁 due to fear and forgetfulness. Sixth, forbearance—able to patiently endure others' mockery, teasing, crude words, opposition, and all such matters. Seventh, tirelessness—with abundant and strong power, able to contemplate extensively. When teaching correct dharma among the four assemblies, speaking without hesitation and mental fatigue. Eighth, skillful guidance—speech perfectly complete, not destroying dharma-nature. Seek and choose such persons as good spiritual friends.

The Nirvāṇa Sūtra states: "Addressing the great assembly: For all sentient beings, as proximate conditions for supreme enlightenment, nothing surpasses good spiritual friends. Why? If King Ajātaśatru had not followed Jīvaka's words, he would have certainly died on the seventh day of the coming month and entered Avīci Hell."

**[Brief Display of the Cultivation Stages Gateway]** Heavenly ponds differ from earth. Flowing waters accept hundreds of streams and reach the ground of non-action. Mountains differ from mounds, accumulating countless dust particles without abandoning any. How much more so—those who aspire to great enlightenment: without accepting myriad practices, how could they realize it? Those who demonstrate benefiting others: without accumulating all virtues, how could they accomplish it? Therefore practitioners must cultivate the practices of dual benefit in the five stages, accumulate the merits of the six perfections in the ten grounds, then complete the causes of near-perfect enlightenment and ascend to the fruition of wondrous enlightenment. The benevolent gate: know this and practice diligently. Those who arise: attain awakening and practice it.

Question: What are the five stages? Answer: First is the accumulation stage. The root verse of Vijñānavāda states: "Until one arouses the cognition of conforming decisive selection seeking to dwell in consciousness-only nature, regarding the latent tendencies of dual grasping, one still cannot subdue and eliminate them."

Question: What does this verse mean? Answer: From arousing deep and firm great bodhicitta until not yet arousing the cognition of conforming decisive selection to seek dwelling in consciousness-only true supreme meaning-nature—up to this point all belongs to the accumulation stage.

Question: Why is it called the accumulation stage? Answer: To approach supreme perfect enlightenment, one cultivates and accumulates various excellent provisions, hence called the accumulation stage.

Question: Why is the accomplishment of this stage called the portion conducive to liberation? Answer: For the sake of sentient beings, diligently seeking liberation. Due to this it is also called the portion conducive to liberation. Bodhisattvas of this stage, depending on inner good friends, intentional effort, provisions, and four superior powers, although they deeply believe and understand consciousness-only meaning, they still cannot comprehend the emptiness of grasper and grasped. Mostly dwelling in external gates, they cultivate bodhisattva practices. The latent tendencies induced by dual grasping still do not have the power to subdue and eliminate, preventing the arising of dual-grasping active manifestations.

The meaning shows that within this stage there are thirty minds cultivating bodhisattva practices. "Provisions" means beneficial resources; "accumulation" means stored supplies. As stored supplies that benefit oneself, it is called the accumulation stage.

Question: What are the thirty minds? Answer: Ten dwellings, ten practices, ten dedications of merit, etc.

Question: Regarding the ten dwellings, what are their numbers? Answer: First, arousing-mind dwelling; Second, ground-purifying dwelling; Third, cultivation dwelling; Fourth, noble-birth dwelling; Fifth, skillful-means-complete dwelling; Sixth, correct-mind dwelling; Seventh, non-regression dwelling; Eighth, pure-youth dwelling; Ninth, dharma-prince dwelling; Tenth, consecration dwelling.

Question: What are the ten practices? Answer: First, joyful practice; Second, beneficial practice; Third, non-anger practice; Fourth, inexhaustible practice; Fifth, non-delusion practice; Sixth, good-manifestation practice; Seventh, non-attachment practice; Eighth, respectful practice; Ninth, good-dharma practice; Tenth, true-reality practice.

Question: What are the ten dedications of merit? Answer: First, protecting sentient beings while transcending sentient being characteristics dedication; Second, indestructible dedication; Third, equal to all buddhas dedication; Fourth, reaching everywhere dedication; Fifth, inexhaustible merit treasury dedication; Sixth, witnessing conformity with all firm good roots

dedication; Seventh, equal mind following all sentient beings dedication; Eighth, suchness characteristics dedication; Ninth, non-attached non-bound liberated mind dedication; Tenth, dharma-realm immeasurable dedication.

Question: Why are the ten dwellings called the dwelling stage? Answer: Initially arousing great bodhicitta, establishing one's mind in the six perfections, four means of guidance, four immeasurables, etc., hence called dwelling. Since the practices are not yet superior, they are not called practices.

Question: Why are the ten practices called the practice stage? Answer: Bodhisattvas of this stage correctly practice the six perfections, four means of guidance and other practices. The characteristics of what they cultivate are already superior, hence called practices.

Question: Why is it called the dedication stage? Answer: With the good that one cultivates, one dedicates toward great enlightenment and dedicates toward all sentient beings, hence called dedication.

What are the meanings and definitions of these thirty minds? The explanation of names is as in separate records; due to verbose annotations, they are not annotated here.

Question: The Saṃgraha treatise's first six [chapters] explain the four location-obstacles. Within the thirty minds, where are these obstacles eliminated? Answer: Eliminating the two-vehicle intentional obstacles, one enters the ten faith-minds. Within the two stages of ten dwellings and ten practices, there are various doubts. Within dedications, one eliminates dharma-attachment. In the four good roots stage, one eliminates discriminatory obstacles.

Question: What is called the two-vehicle intentional obstacle? Answer: Beginning bodhisattvas, seeing the sufferings of birth-and-death, hearing the bliss of nirvāṇa, become weary of the six realms of birth-and-death and wish to quickly realize two-vehicle nirvāṇa. This is called two-vehicle intention. Being able to eliminate this intention, one can enter the bodhisattva faith stage.

Question: Why must this intention be eliminated first? Answer: Such intention can obstruct the great Mahāyāna bodhisattva fruit, therefore it is eliminated first.

Question: Cultivating what contemplation can one eliminate this intention? Answer: Contemplating...

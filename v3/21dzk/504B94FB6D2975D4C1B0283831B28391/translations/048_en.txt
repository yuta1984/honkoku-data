body, and third is the transformation body. Question: What is called the transformation body? Answer: There are two transformation bodies. First is the Buddha-form transformation body, second is the five destinies transformation body. Question: What is the meaning of this? Answer: Coming down from heaven, being born in the royal palace, six years of ascetic practice, attaining enlightenment under the tree, responding to humans and devas, finally accomplishing the Buddha form. After the Buddha's passing, manifesting the five destinies bodies, which are not the Buddha form. There are the Buddha's worldly body and the post-parinirvana body, therefore there are two transformations.

Question: When one person develops bodhicitta, cultivates, and attains the fruit, why must there necessarily be three bodies in the fruit? Answer: At the time of initial arousal of bodhicitta, two kinds of wisdom arise. First is the vow to seek bodhi, second is the vow to benefit others. By seeking bodhisattva wisdom, one attains the dharma body. This is the true Buddha body, pervading the entire dharma realm with no place where it doesn't exist. It possesses the four wisdom categories and attains the four nirvanas, being peaceful, blissful, permanently abiding, and unchanging. The three dots and four virtues are perfectly complete. Through the wisdom of benefiting others, that true Buddha body transforms into two kinds of bodies. First is the sambhogakāya for others. This transforms into this body for tenth-ground bodhisattvas, etc. Second is the transformation body. This transforms into this body for pre-ground Two Vehicle practitioners and ordinary beings. Because there are two kinds of beings to be taught, there are two kinds of bodies. Combined with the original true body, they form the three bodies.

Question: Such three bodies are known to have three distinctions through wisdom, but are the three bodies attained because there are three in the cause, or are the three bodies attained without separate causes? Answer: There are separate causes and conditions for attaining the three bodies. Namely, first is the generating cause, second is the revealing cause. The generating cause refers to the naturally inherent seed essence that has existed since beginningless time, which is of superior quality. There are also the six perfections, which assist the generating cause. Thus, through these primary and auxiliary generating causes, these three bodies are attained. Question: Do the Buddha's three

**Lower Section:**
bodies come only from generating causes, or are there revealing causes? Answer: The principle dharma body Buddha is attained through the revealing cause; the others are attained through generating causes. Question: Are these so-called two causes separate or the same? Answer: One cause has two distinctions. Namely, in relation to the principle dharma body, it serves as the revealing cause; in relation to the other Buddha bodies, it serves as the generating cause. The six perfections and naturally inherent seeds are divided into two in relation to the fruit.

Question: How many dharma gates are attained among these three bodies? Answer: They fully possess the four wisdoms, four nirvanas, and other boundless dharma gates. Question: What are called the four wisdoms? Answer: First is great perfect mirror wisdom, second is equality nature wisdom, third is wonderful observation wisdom, fourth is accomplishing action wisdom.

Question: What is called great perfect mirror wisdom? Answer: "Great" means vast and extensive. "Perfect" means complete and round. "Mirror" means reflection and illumination, using metaphor as the name. Like a great bright mirror manifesting various images, this wisdom can similarly manifest the wisdom-reflections of the generated bodies and lands. Therefore it is called perfect mirror.

Question: There are eight consciousnesses in the causal stage; which consciousness is transformed to attain this perfect mirror wisdom? Answer: The eighth consciousness is transformed to attain this wisdom.

Question: What is called equality nature wisdom? Answer: "Equal" means uniform and level. "Equality" means even and same. "Nature" means true nature, getting its name from the object. Because it contemplates the equality nature of all dharmas and self-other sentient beings, it is therefore called equality nature wisdom. Question: Which consciousness is transformed to attain this? Answer: The seventh manas consciousness is transformed to attain this wisdom. Therefore it is called equality nature wisdom.

Question: What is called wonderful observation wisdom? Answer: "Wonderful" means excellent and marvelous. "Observation" means contemplative illumination. "Investigation" has careful examination, getting its name from function. It illuminates principle and wisdom of characteristics and nature, turning without obstruction, therefore it is called wonderful observation wisdom. Question: What is called accomplishing action wisdom? Answer: "Accomplishing"

**Upper Section:**
means successful completion, having the meaning of what is accomplished. "Action" means transformative creation, getting its name from function. To benefit sentient beings, it creates transformations, therefore it is called accomplishing action wisdom. The first two are possessive compounds; the latter two are descriptive compounds.

Question: What do such four wisdoms take as their essence? Answer: If taken by intrinsic nature, they take wisdom among the specific object mental factors as essence. If taken by retinue, they take the five aggregates that correspondingly arise together as essence. Question: How many dharmas do such four wisdoms accompany? Answer: Twenty-one dharmas are constantly in correspondence. Including the mind-king, there are twenty-two dharmas. Question: What are the twenty-one dharmas? Answer: Five omnipresent, five specific object, eleven wholesome, combined as twenty-one. Including the mind-king, they are twenty-two.

Question: The Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṅkāra says "Transform the five consciousnesses to attain wonderful observation wisdom. Transform the mental consciousness to attain action wisdom." Why is there discrepancy with this explanation? Answer: That Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṅkāra has translator errors. Some say it is to show function, which is not unreasonable.

Question: At what stage do such eight consciousnesses transform into the four wisdoms? Answer: The two wisdoms of wonderful observation and equality nature begin transformation in the seeing path of the first ground. Regarding these two wisdoms and perfect mirror and accomplishing action wisdoms, there are two explanations. One says only subsequently attained wisdom; one says there is also fundamental wisdom. The other three all possess both.

Question: Why doesn't the first ground transform the fifth and eighth, but only two wisdoms? Answer: Because the eighth consciousness is the root of birth and death. If it transformed in the first ground, who would hold the contaminated seeds of the ten grounds? The five consciousnesses depend on the five sense organs which are contaminated, so how could they be transformed?

Question: Why does great perfect mirror wisdom only correspond with the eighth and not others? Answer: The eighth consciousness, from beginningless time, can hold contaminated and

**Lower Section:**
uncontaminated seeds for all births without loss, constantly present in the Buddha fruit stage. This wisdom can sustain the three wisdoms, bodies, and lands. Therefore it accompanies the eighth.

Question: Why does equality nature wisdom accompany the seventh? Answer: The seventh consciousness in the causal stage, due to self-grasping, has self-other distinctions. Now without self-grasping, there is equal great compassion, etc., constantly corresponding together. Therefore it accompanies this consciousness.

Question: Why does wonderful observation accompany the mental consciousness? Answer: This sixth consciousness, in the causal stage, can cognize the individual and universal characteristics of all dharmas. In the fruition stage, this wisdom accompanying this consciousness wonderfully observes the individual and universal characteristics of all dharmas to explain for others. The merit of perfect cause cannot be measured; the virtue of complete fruit has no limit. The four wisdom mind-groups, four nirvanas, three bodies, four virtues, three mindfulness dwellings, Tathāgata's ten powers, three fearlessnesses, four kinds of fearlessness, exclusive dharmas, four kinds of all-seed purity, three dots great compassion, ten masteries, possessing the thirty-two marks of a great being, eighty subsidiary marks, countless unforgetting dharmas, four wonderful wisdoms, fully possessing one hundred forty dharmas. Fearing that people of the final age would grow weary, I abbreviate. I wish all wise ones would know this together.

I now briefly praise and describe according to my ability. The ordinary mind cannot understand or accord with principle. Offering to our sovereign, expecting a thousand generations, constantly turning the golden wheel, bringing down ten thousand leaves. All ministers and officials support the court; may the body be healthy, life long, peaceful and joyful. May all sentient beings equally gain blessings, quickly exit birth-death and realize nirvana.

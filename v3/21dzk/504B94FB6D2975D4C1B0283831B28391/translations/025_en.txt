**Chapter 3 of the Mahāyāna Yogācāra Research Divine Text**

**Upper Section**
"In that also this exists" means that within that two-fold emptiness nature, there also exists this false discrimination. If this is not existent, then by observing through that [emptiness], it becomes empty, and since the remainder is non-existent, one knows it as truly existent. If it is thus, then one can reveal the characteristics of emptiness without error.

"Therefore all dharmas are spoken of" refers to all conditioned and unconditioned dharmas. False discrimination is called conditioned, and the emptiness nature of the two grasps is called unconditioned. Based on the previous principle, it says "all dharmas are neither empty nor non-empty." Because there is emptiness nature and false discrimination, it says "non-empty." Because there is no nature of grasped and grasper, it says "empty." "Non-non-empty" means there is emptiness nature and false discrimination. "Because of non-existence" means there is no dual nature of grasped and grasper. "Because of existence, non-existence, and existence" means there is emptiness nature within false discrimination, and there is false discrimination within emptiness nature.

"This then accords with the middle way" means all dharmas are neither uniformly empty nor uniformly non-empty. Such reasoning wonderfully accords with the middle way and also well conforms to the Prajñāpāramitā and other sūtras' teaching that "all dharmas are neither empty nor existent."

Q: "What dharma is 'false discrimination exists'? Is it the imagined nature or the dependent nature?"
A: "The prose commentary states 'it means there is discrimination of grasped and grasper.' The meaning is that grasped and grasper are the objects of discrimination, and 'discrimination' is what cognizes the grasped and grasper. Therefore it is called 'existent.' The dependent mind is thus called false."

Q: "Within the dependent nature, what among the contaminated and uncontaminated is called false?"
A: "First, contaminated defiled dependent nature is mentioned and called false. In principle, uncontaminated dependent arising nature is also false."

**Lower Section**
Q: "How can we know that uncontaminated dependent nature is a false dharma?"
A: "Though not false when compared to defiled dharmas, it is a false dharma when compared to true suchness. The supreme first true suchness is real; all else is false. It also says 'the unborn is real, the born is false,' and 'unreal dharmas arise from conditions; real dharmas do not arise from conditions.' Therefore, it can be known that uncontaminated dependent nature can also be called false discrimination without impediment."

Master Fan asked: "If uncontaminated conditioned [dharmas] are truly real, why does the Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra say 'among false dharmas, formations are most false'? Therefore, even though the uncontaminated is not among formations, is it called false?"

A: "Though knowing that uncontaminated conditioned [dharmas] are called false in relation to true suchness and perfect realization, in relation to defilement they are also perfect realization, so they are not false. Through this, though defilement is false, it obtains this designation. According to this master's intention, defilement is first mentioned, so it is called false. Uncontaminated dependent nature, though false in relation to true suchness nature, is not false in relation to defilement. The principle I now state is also thus."

Moreover, the Buddha's fruition of uncontaminated dependent nature is also false. Through great compassion as condition, it also seems to exist, but in reality it is dharma without inherent nature. Since it is called without inherent nature, this is insubstantial. How is it real? Since it is called unreal, how is it not false? Therefore...

Even if there is uncontaminated dependent arising mind, all being false discrimination presents no impediment.

Q: "I hear that the Three Treatises and Yogācāra constantly have disputational doctrines. What is this dispute like?"
A: "The two schools have no dispute. The Three Treatises' intention was to establish empty medicine to break attachment to existence. Asaṅga and Vasubandhu both transmitted that school. What dispute is there within this? Only after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, in the 1,100th year, Bhāvaviveka appeared in the world and separately composed great treatises, giving rise to disputational discourse. This is not what the Three Treatises and Yogācāra disputed.

The Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra states: 'The World-Honored One in the past second period, only for those cultivating the Mahāyāna, based on all dharmas being without inherent nature, unborn and unceasing, originally tranquil, of the nature of nirvāṇa, turned the wheel of true Dharma. The World-Honored One now in the third period, universally for those setting forth toward all vehicles, based on all dharmas being without inherent nature, up to the nature of nirvāṇa, the naturelessness nature, turned the wheel of true Dharma.'

The Three Treatises school, based on naturelessness nature, teaches the emptiness of all dharmas. This already accords with the sūtra's meaning. Through this, what does Asaṅga and Vasubandhu's transmitted teaching dispute? However, Master Bhāvaviveka, not relying on naturelessness nature, separately established the emptiness school. Dispute arose from this. The two schools have no dispute.

Regarding the World-Honored One's statement in the second period about 'all dharmas being without inherent nature, etc.'—if one raises 'all empty' without relying on naturelessness, then that Master Bhāvaviveka violates the Tathāgata's teaching and has already given rise to wrong views. How could right view dispute with this?

However, 1,100 years after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, Bodhisattva Bhāvaviveka appeared in the world and composed treatises, explaining the doctrine of dharma-emptiness. The Hastavāla-nāma-prakaraṇa, one work in two volumes, violated the schools of Nāgārjuna, Āryadeva and others, and diverged from the teachings of Maitreya, Asaṅga and others. Due to this treatise, disputational discourse first arose, disputing...

...the schools of emptiness and existence. The emptiness reasoning for the conditioned refutes eighteen views; the emptiness reasoning for the unconditioned is also thus.

Q: "That treatise master said: 'Equally observing the world—improper investigation, snared by wrong views, caged by birth and death. Therefore, I rely on stopping disputes like space, cutting off all conceptual elaborations, based on the tranquil and blissful ultimate truth principle, briefly compose this treatise and extensively establish those reasonings.' He then established inferential reasoning, with the verse: 'True nature conditioned empty, like illusion, because of dependent arising. The unconditioned does not exist, truly does not arise, like sky-flowers.'

You now say 'Therefore I rely on stopping and rest in the ultimate truth principle that cuts off all conceptual elaborations,' yet without conceptual elaborations you give rise to conceptual elaborations. This is the fault of self-contradictory statement. The Nyāyamukha states: 'That self-contradictory statement makes all past words false.' Taking one's own words as correct and others' words as false—considering one's own words real and other words false—this is self-contradiction. Now you say you rely on non-elaboration yet immediately generate elaboration. Your words contradict before and after. Your establishment does not succeed. If relying on non-elaboration, there can be no elaboration, but relying on non-elaboration to generate elaboration—how is this correct?"

Q: "You constantly establish that all dharmas, in relation to true ultimate reality, have no substance whatsoever, while all dharmas, in relation to conventional truth, all have substance. Now in the subject dharma, you raise 'conditioned'—what conditioned is this? Is it conditioned of the true nature gate, or conditioned of conventional truth?"

A: "I raise conventional conditioned to make it empty."

Q: "Regarding your conditioned of the conventional truth gate—you consider that existent. How do you say 'it is empty'? This violates the thesis. If it is conditioned of the ultimate truth gate, it has no substance. Since the qualified subject 'conditioned' does not exist, this is the fault of unestablished qualified subject." 

Q: "Now...

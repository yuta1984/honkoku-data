**Upper Section:**
If [all beings] possess these faculties, how can we establish the **distinction of Five Vehicles**?

**Answer:** Among these **five faculties**, some only produce **human and divine fruits**, some only produce **fruits of the Two Vehicles**, and some only produce **bodhisattva fruits**. Each, in relation to their own vehicle, serves as the **essence of spiritual lineage**. Some commonly produce **bodhisattva and śrāvaka Two Vehicle fruits**. Some commonly produce **bodhisattva and pratyekabuddha Two Vehicle fruits**. These are **people with indeterminate lineage of Two Vehicles**. They ultimately attain **the fruit of Mahāyāna bodhi**. Some commonly produce **śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha Two Vehicle fruits**. These are **people with determinate lineage of Two Vehicles**. They ultimately do not attain **the fruit of Buddha's bodhi**. Some commonly produce **bodhisattva, śrāvaka, and pratyekabuddha fruits**. These are **people with indeterminate lineage of Three Vehicles**. They ultimately attain **the person of Mahāyāna bodhi**.

**Question:** Regarding **Three Vehicle people**, that those **determined in their own vehicles** and **indeterminate people** attain **Buddha's bodhi**—what scriptural passages [support this]?

**Answer:** The **Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra**, 593 volumes, among the **sixteen assemblies**, the **sixteenth assembly** states: When the Buddha was beside the **White Dew Pond**, **Bodhisattva Śūravīrya** requested, saying: "We only wish, World-Honored One, that you compassionately take pity on us and fully expound the **Buddha's sphere of wisdom**. If there are **sentient beings determined in śrāvaka vehicle nature**, after hearing this Dharma, they will quickly be able to realize **their own uncontaminated stage**. Those **determined in pratyekabuddha vehicle nature**, after hearing this Dharma, will quickly rely on **their own vehicle** and attain **liberation**. Those **determined in supreme vehicle nature**, after hearing this Dharma, will quickly realize **supreme perfect bodhi**. If there are **sentient beings** who, although they have not yet **entered the nature of certainty in liberation**, are **indeterminate regarding the Three Vehicle natures**, after hearing this Dharma, will all **arouse the mind of supreme perfect awakening**. We only wish the Tathāgata would answer our questions." This sutra only speaks of **people with spiritual lineage** **entering the noble path** and does not speak of **ultimate great compassion and severed wholesome [roots]**. Based on such reasoning, **Master Jīki of the Mahāyāna** [school]...

**Lower Section:**
...established a **syllogism** saying: "**The fruits of the Two Vehicles should have determinate lineage** [**Thesis**]. **Because they are what vehicles are directed toward** [**Reason**]. **Like those who have lineage** [**Example**]." Thus, **determinate lineage Two Vehicle [practitioners]** are only determined in **their own vehicles** and do not turn to **Mahāyāna**.

The **Avataṃsaka Sūtra**, volume 51, states: "On the peak of the **Snow Mountain** there is a **Medicine King Tree** named **Inexhaustible Root**. The roots of that tree extend from **160,800 yojanas** below down to the **limits of the vajra earth and water wheels**, giving birth to that **Medicine King Tree**. In **all places** it causes **growth**. Only in **two places** is it unable to **provide the benefit of growth**. Namely, the **deep pits of hell** and **within the water wheel**. Yet even regarding them, it initially has **no aversion or abandonment**. **Buddha-sons**, the **Tathāgata's wisdom**, the **Great Medicine King Tree**, is also like this. Only in **two places** is it unable to **provide the benefit of growth**. Namely, **Two Vehicle [practitioners] who have fallen into the vast deep pit of the unconditioned** and **non-receptive sentient beings with destroyed wholesome roots** who are **drowning in the waters of great wrong views and greedy attachment**. Yet even regarding them, it has never had **aversion or abandonment**." This is **the seventh characteristic of the Tathāgata's mind**. This reveals that in the bodies of **people with determinate Two Vehicle [lineage]** and **sentient beings with ultimately no lineage**, **Tathāgata wisdom does not arise**.

**Question:** The **Lotus Sūtra's** **Skillful Means Chapter** states: "In the **Buddha-lands of the ten directions**, there is **only One Vehicle Dharma**. There is **neither two nor three**. **Except for the Buddha's skillful means teachings**." How can we now speak of **determinate lineage Two Vehicle** and **ultimately no lineage** as separately **not accomplishing**? Since the **Lotus** already speaks of **excluding skillful means teachings**, those **determined in Three Vehicle natures** in the **Prajñāpāramitā** and the **two types of people** in the **Avataṃsaka** who do not give rise to **Buddha wisdom in their bodies**—these are **skillful means teachings**.

**Answer:** In response to **indeterminate lineages**, in order to **attract them** to **progress toward the One Buddha Vehicle**, [the Buddha] immediately spoke of "**no remainder**." In reality, there are **distinctions among Three Vehicles and Five Lineages**. The **Medicinal Herbs Parable Chapter** states: "It is like **one rain universally moistening all three grasses and two trees**, yet their **growth is not the same**. **Buddha's teaching** is also thus. Although it **universally pours equally**, what is **moistened** is...

**Upper Section:**
...separate. **Three Vehicles and Five Lineages** receive **moisture** each differently." The treatise states: In order to **eliminate the illness of [thinking] vehicles are the same**, the Buddha **explained this parable**. In order to **attract the indeterminate**, upon hearing the teaching of "**only one**," they **cling to [there being] no remainder**. In order to **eliminate this clinging**, [the Buddha] **explained this parable**. The **Peaceful Practices Chapter** explains the **parable of the bright pearl**. Those **given other wealth** are **determinate lineage Two Vehicle [practitioners]**. Those **given bright pearls** are **indeterminate lineage people**. Looking broadly at such scriptural passages and extensively studying **Buddha's intention**, it is evident that there are **Two Vehicle people** who **do not receive bright pearls**. Who are these people? Those who, having **completed the practices of the Ten Stages** equally, **receive the bright pearl from the topknot**—who are these people?

The **Śrīmālādevī Sūtra** states: "**Sentient beings separated from good spiritual friends**, **unlearned in non-Dharma**, are **matured only through the wholesome roots of human and divine merit**."

The **Mahālaṃkāra Śāstra**, in **Maitreya's verses**, states: "**Exclusively practicing evil conduct**, **universally severing all white dharmas**, **having no liberation portion**, **little wholesomeness and also no causes**." In the **fifth no-nature [category]**, there are **these five people**. Saying "**also no causes**" refers to **ultimately no nature**. The **first four** are **temporary**.

Based on these **sutras and treatises**, **Master Jīki of the Mahāyāna** [school] established a **syllogism** saying: "The **spoken of no-nature** **definitely exists** [**Thesis**]. **Because [it] is included in one of the two natures—existence and non-existence—as taught by sages** [**Reason**]. **Like those with nature** [**Example**]."

**Question:** Among **sentient beings**, some **have spiritual lineage** and some **lack spiritual lineage**. We already know this through **teachings**. There is also **evidential establishment through the reasoning of syllogisms**. Though we hear and know of **determinate lineage**, **no-nature**, and **no Buddha lineage**, it is not yet clear. **What people** are considered **no-nature**? **What people** are considered **people with spiritual lineage**?

**Answer:** Through **six types of characteristics**, one can know **no-nature**.

**Question:** What are the **six characteristics**?

**Answer:** **First**, being **deeply stained by self-love**, **firmly attached to worldly affairs**, **solid and immovable**. **Second**, they again **hear teachings through countless approaches** that **criticize the many faults of saṃsāra** and again **hear through countless approaches** that **praise the many virtues of nirvāṇa**, yet regarding **saṃsāra** they do not **arouse even a small portion of mind of disgust and renunciation**, and regarding **nirvāṇa** they do not **see even a small portion of mind [recognizing its] virtues**. **Third**, that person's **original nature** has **matured supreme shamelessness and lack of embarrassment**. **Fourth**, regarding **all kinds of excellent principles**, **beautiful and wondrous**, **easily understood words and eloquence**, **Four Noble Truths**, **dependent origination**, **three natures**, **consciousness-only principles**—when these are **revealed and explained**, they are **unable to obtain even a small portion of understanding** or **arouse even a small portion of [bodhicitta]**. How much less could they **attain body hair standing on end, sorrowful weeping and flowing tears**! **Fifth**, they are again **sometimes pressed by kings and bandits**, **sometimes pressed by masters**, **sometimes pressed by fear of not surviving**. Even if **temporarily** they **leave home and enter the path**, after having **left home**, they **mix together with householders and other groups**, either **arising wrong views** or **arising wrong desires**, either **for birth in heaven** or **for other rebirths**, **abandoning received precepts**, **breaking precepts and evil conduct**, **inwardly harboring decay** while **outwardly manifesting integrity**, **acting weakly like conch sounds**, **displaying the form of śramaṇas**. **Sixth**, when **performing wholesome acts**, they do so **exclusively for themselves**, **entirely for future existence**, **completely lacking supramundane mind**. Through such **six characteristics**, one can **know no-nature**.

**Lower Section:**
**Question:** Regarding such **six characteristics**, should one **possess all six** or **[just] one by one**?

**Answer:** [They can be known] **one by one**. Or **two, three, four, five, or six** are **easy to know**. If they **lack Two Vehicle uncontaminated spiritual lineage**, they should be **known thus**.

**Question:** **What people** turn into **people without bodhisattva lineage**?

**Answer:** Those **lacking the coarse characteristics of the Six Perfections**—are they **such people**?

**Question:** **What people** are **people with bodhisattva spiritual lineage**?

**Answer:** Those **with bodhisattva lineage** **definitely have the coarse characteristics of the Six Pāramitā spiritual lineages**.

**Question:** What are **those coarse characteristics**?

**Answer:** Namely, **bodhisattvas** by **original nature are joyful types** who **enjoy praise, encouragement, and transformation**. In **blameless matters**, they **speak appropriately for others**. They **do not default on others' debts**, **receive entrustments without error**. Amid **great wealth and treasures**, their **minds have no attachment**. These are the **characteristics of dāna (giving) spiritual lineage**. If **[their] nature matures**, **evil categories and evil karma** do not extremely harm...

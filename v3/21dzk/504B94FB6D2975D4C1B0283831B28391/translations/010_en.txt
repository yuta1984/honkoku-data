All can achieve perfect fulfillment. Therefore, all sentient beings should diligently cultivate and study this. Just as all cities, towns, and villages depend on the great earth to obtain secure dwelling, and all medicinal herbs, plants, groves, and forests depend on the earth to obtain growth, these ten virtuous paths are likewise. All humans and gods depend on them to stand; all śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhi, and bodhisattva practices, and all Buddha dharmas together depend on this great earth of the ten virtues to achieve accomplishment. Discussion arises from discussion. Question: "Ten" is a numerical designation—what is the meaning of "virtue"? Answer: The meaning of benefit in this world and other worlds—this is the meaning of virtue. Question: What is called "this world" and what is called "other world"? Answer: The present is called "this," and the future is called "other." Thus, virtue means the meaning of benefit—that is, benefiting oneself and benefiting others is the meaning of beneficial accordance. Question: If there is benefit in this world but harm in other worlds, or harm in this world but benefit in other worlds, are these called virtues? Answer: These are not virtues. Question: If dharmas are like this, what nature should they be called? Answer: Unwholesomeness and moral neutrality have such characteristics. One can infer and understand this.

Question: Within the ten virtues there are one hundred practices—what is this about? Answer: Regarding the ten unwholesome acts: slightly abandoning killing up to slightly abandoning wrong views is called the first ten practices. If one largely abandons killing up to largely abandons wrong views, this is called the second ten practices. If one completely abandons killing up to completely abandons wrong views, this is called the third ten practices. If one abandons killing for a short time up to abandons wrong views for a short time—meaning perhaps one day and night, or half a month to one month, or up to one year—this is called the fourth ten practices. If one abandons killing for a long time up to abandons wrong views for a long time—meaning more than one year but not until death—this is called the fifth ten practices. If one abandons killing for one's entire life up to abandons wrong views for one's entire life, this is called the sixth ten practices. If one personally abandons killing up to personally abandons wrong views, this is called the seventh ten practices. If regarding these matters one encourages others to advance, this is called the eighth ten practices. If regarding these matters one praises and describes them through countless means, this is called the ninth ten practices. If upon seeing those who abandon killing up to those who abandon wrong views, one deeply rejoices and generates great joy, this is called the tenth ten practices. Such ten times ten practices are collectively called the one hundred practices. The first three positions concern matters, the next three positions concern time, and the latter four positions concern people.

Question: How can complete abandonment and short-time practices be said to have one hundred? Or what difference is there between the ten of entire lifetime and self-receiving and teaching others? Answer: Because understanding, objects of consciousness, and aspirations differ. Question: What is the essence of such virtuous dharmas? Answer: There are eleven kinds of dharmas that, because they only arise together with virtuous minds, are called virtuous. All virtuous dharmas have these eleven as their essence. Question: What are called the eleven virtues? The root verse of Vijñānavāda states: "Virtues are faith, shame, and moral dread; the three roots of non-greed and others; diligence, tranquility, non-carelessness; equanimity of conduct and non-harming." Among these, ten dharmas pervade the three realms. Mental buoyancy lacks desire. These ten dharmas necessarily arise simultaneously when a virtuous mind arises. Due to brevity, this is stopped here.

Having briefly revealed the causes and effects of virtue, next the causes and effects of evil are revealed. Question: What are the ten evil karmas? Answer: These can be known by reversing the ten virtues. Question: Those ten evil karmas can be known by reversing virtue, but how should their resultant fruits be understood? Answer: There are two approaches: first, the approach of giving results; second, the approach of harm and benefit.

Question: What is meant by the approach of giving results and the approach of harm and benefit? Answer: The approach of giving results can give five fruits: first, giving ripening results; second, giving concordant results; third, giving dominant results; fourth, giving results in this life; fifth, giving dominant results for others. Question: What constitutes giving ripening results? Answer: If one creates the ten evil karmas, one will necessarily first sink into hell. The eight hot hells, eight cold hells, neighboring hells, solitary hells, and others are the ripening results obtained from the ten evil karmas. Briefly revealing their suffering characteristics: These various hells have no sun or moon and are extremely dark. Cauldrons of boiling liquid surge, furnace fires explode with sounds that split heaven and earth. Upon contact, all immediately becomes dust and ash; upon entry, all rots and becomes gruel. Iron balls and molten copper enter the mouth, dissolving the five organs and six viscera. Hot copper and fire pillars constantly serve as bedding; when touching the body, all immediately burns and flames. For long periods without interruption, containing poison. Even if described for ten thousand eons with a thousand tongues, it could never be exhausted. Practitioners must contemplate these sinful retributions—how can one avoid them without sorrow?

Question: Having already understood the suffering characteristics of ripening results, what are the concordant results? Answer: The suffering retributions of hungry ghosts, animals, and humans are the concordant results obtained from the ten evil karmas. Briefly revealing these evil retributions: Barely escaping hell, one next falls into the hungry ghost realm. Their retribution forms are extremely ugly and very coarse. Their necks are extremely thin like needles and awls. Their bellies and heads are extremely large, surpassing mountains. Their round eyes are deep like stars in wells. When barely approaching food, it transforms into fierce fire; when approaching rivers wanting to drink, it suddenly becomes pus and blood. Seeking water for ten thousand springs, it's already difficult to see; seeking food for a thousand autumns, how can it be easily heard? Though scheming a hundred times for temporary peace, it becomes ever more distant; though wanting to die a thousand times, this too is difficult. Barely escaping hungry ghosts, one next falls into animal birth.

The retribution of various animals in water, land, mountains, and marshes is extremely painful. Briefly revealing their characteristics: Horses and oxen bear saddles on their backs and carry loads on their necks. If slow, they are beaten; if fast, their bellies are torn. Exhausting strength and crushing bodies in spring plowing and autumn harvesting, when fruit ripens, they are completely cut off from any share. This is not what they emotionally desire. Withered grass and muddy water are never sufficient. Alas, karmic obstacles! Various birds like pheasants, herds like deer—when encountering conditions of being killed, birds lose their companions and fly about in alarmed chaos; beasts separate from their kind and compete in frantic running. Each facing final moisture, they individually shed tears. Hearing sounds of killing, they all cut their own bellies; though attempting to soar in empty space, hawks pursue them. If entering marshy thickets, dogs seek them; though taking refuge in trees for shelter, arrows are shot hitting them completely. Though heaven, earth, mountains, and forests are vast, there is no place for concealment. Looking hopefully in all four directions, there is utterly no salvation. Who with Buddha-nature would not feel sorrowful compassion for this? Whether scaled or feathered, such mixed categories have numerous suffering characteristics, so this is stopped here. Barely escaping animal birth, if born among humans, each obtains two kinds of results.

Depending on the sin of killing, two results are obtained: first, short life retribution; second, much illness retribution. Depending on the sin of stealing, two results are obtained: first, poverty retribution; second, shared wealth without autonomy. The two results of sexual misconduct: first, one's wife not being chaste and virtuous; second, wives quarreling and not following one's heart. The two results of false speech: first, frequently being slandered; second, constantly being hated by many people. The two results of divisive speech: first, obtaining destroyed retinue; second, obtaining corrupt and evil retinue. The two results of harsh speech: first, constantly hearing evil sounds; second, all one's words constantly having disputes and litigation. The two results of frivolous speech: first, when speaking correct words, people do not trust or accept them; second, one's words cannot be articulated clearly. The two results of greed...

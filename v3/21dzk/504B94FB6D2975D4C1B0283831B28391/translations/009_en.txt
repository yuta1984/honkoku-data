Why is abandoning the ten [unwholesome acts] considered good?
Answer: Life is the foundation of the body. Those who kill living bodies and extinguish life cut off the root of form and exhaust life and form. This is what living beings treasure and what spiritual beings value. Regarding one's own bodily life, there is endless greed and attachment, while toward others' lives and forms there is extreme contempt and scorn. Therefore this is now established for the first time. When a wheel-turning king appears in the world, he rules the four great continents and causes all lesser kings to practice the ten virtues. All lesser kings submit to his transformation and are able to practice the ten virtues. The ten virtues are: first, abandoning killing; second, abandoning stealing; third, abandoning sexual misconduct—these constitute the three of the body. Fourth, abandoning false speech; fifth, abandoning harsh speech; sixth, abandoning divisive speech; seventh, abandoning meaningless speech—these constitute the four of speech. Eighth, abandoning miserliness; ninth, abandoning hatred; tenth, abandoning wrong views—these constitute the three of mind. Though the words seem repetitive, they are not thorough enough, and because people of the degenerate age are far from progress, they are stated twice.

**Mahāyāna Yogācāra Research and Investigation Chapter, Volume 4**

**Right Page Upper Section:**
In **Magadha country**, in the **Veṇuvana** (Bamboo Grove), there was a **wise householder**. His reputation and virtue were uniquely high, and his way was known throughout the **Five Indies**. The sages of that time did not dare aspire to his honored status, and he was called **Bhārtṛka**. This means "**feudal lord**." His scholarly influence surpassed all others, and he rightfully deserved to receive a feudal territory. This was **Śubhagupta the treatise master**.

However, this treatise master established **one syllogism** against various **Hīnayāna [schools]**. The words of that syllogism said: "**All Mahāyāna sutras are Buddha's teachings** [Thesis]. **Because they are mutually extremely established as not included in what are not the Buddhas' words** [Reason]. **Like the Ekottara Āgama etc.** [Example]." For over **forty years**, no one dared to challenge or question [this].

**Master Xuanzang** arrived in that India and judged the syllogism, saying: "**There is an indefiniteness fallacy**. That **Abhidharmajñānaprasthāna** is self-accepted by the **Sarvāstivādin masters** as Buddha's teaching, but other **Hīnayāna** and **Mahāyāna** [followers] also [consider it] mutually extremely established as not included in Buddha's words. If so, this treatise is mutually extremely established as not included in the Buddhas' words." That Sarvāstivādin constructed an **indefiniteness [fallacy]** saying: "**Like your self-accepted Abhidharmajñānaprasthāna, which is mutually extremely established as not included in the Buddhas' words, are your Mahāyāna sutras not Buddha's words? Or like the Ekottara etc., which are mutually extremely established as not included in the Buddhas' words, are your Mahāyāna sutras Buddha's teachings?**"

This **indefiniteness fallacy** was truly difficult to escape. Therefore **Xuanzang** placed the word "**self-accepted**" above that reason, immediately blocking this fallacy.

In **Japan's sacred dynasty**, there was a **great renowned master**. His personal name was **Zenshū**. His **precept-jewel** was without flaw, and his **wisdom-mirror** had clear reflection. During the **Enryaku period**, at **Chūgū-ji Temple** he lectured on **logic** (hetuvidyā). A **questioning monk** was in the assembly and, regarding this syllogism, constructed a **definite contradiction** saying: "**All Mahāyāna sutras are not Buddha's teachings** [Thesis]. **Because they are self-accepted as extremely established and not included in Buddha's words** [Reason]. **Like the Ṣaṭpadārtha-śāstra etc.** [Example]." That **Hīnayāna [follower]** [held that] **Mahāyāna sutras are not Buddha's teachings**, while this **Mahāyāna [follower]** [held that] **Mahāyāna sutras are all Buddha's teachings**. The **proponent** and **opponent**...

**Lower Section:**
...mutually alternated, separately stating that they are definitely not Buddha's teachings. Because they are definitely not Buddha's teachings, they are not included in **extremely established Buddha's teachings**. They are not included in **extremely established non-Buddha's teachings**. The **Mahāyāna school's** intention takes the meaning of "**not included in extremely established non-Buddha's words**" and makes this the reason. The **Hīnayāna school's** intention takes the meaning of "**not included in extremely established Buddha's words**" and constructs the contradiction. Both sides are equal—what should be considered correct? **Master Daimyō** did not dare refute the fallacy.

**Question:** In **definite contradiction**, who is the winner and who is the loser?

**Answer:** **Definite contradiction**—the former is wrong, the latter is wrong, both former and latter are **indefinite dharmas**. Who can be considered winner or loser? However, the **proponent's** intention originally wanted to establish the thesis but could not achieve establishment, thus becoming the loser. **Master Wengui** said: "Like the meaning of delayed killing in chess—there are various contradictory beliefs, which are inconvenient to use."

**Question:** **Definite contradiction** has no fallacies in the **three members**. Why is it not considered correct but becomes **indefinite**?

**Answer:** The **three members** have no fallacies. The former is thus, the latter is also thus. The **witness** has a **hesitant mind** and lacks **definite measurement**, therefore this is a **doubtful reason**.

**Question:** What makes it a **doubtful reason**?

**Answer:** Both former and latter are thus.

**Question:** This syllogism was already used as a **correct syllogism** in the **Western regions**, and also used as a **correct syllogism** in the **Great Tang**. Yet now there are fallacies—what does this mean?

**Answer:** **Later scholars** seek to escape [the fallacies] through investigation.

**Question:** Someone says there is escape: "**The reason has [the fallacy of] non-establishment for one party**." What is this? Since there is "**self-accepted as not included in Buddha's words**," **Mahāyāna** does not accept [this], therefore there is **non-establishment for one party**.

**Answer:** It is not **only self-accepted**; there is additionally "**extremely established**." The **Mahāyāna** self-accepts that their **Mahāyāna sutras** are neither **extremely established Buddha's teachings** nor **extremely established non-Buddha's teachings**. Taking one side as the reason—if there is **non-establishment for one party**, taking one side as the reason, in the **original syllogism's reason** there is the **fallacy of non-establishment for one party**. **Later scholars**, think deeply!

**Briefly revealing the Eleventh Gate: The Gate of Differences in Spiritual Lineages**

**Spiritual lineage** (gotra) means the meaning of **causal nature**. **Differences** means the meaning of **multiplicity**. Since those spiritual lineages are multiple and not one, therefore [we speak of] **differences in spiritual lineages**. [This is] distinguished through **four gates**: 1) **Listing names**, 2) **Explaining names**, 3) **Revealing essence**, 4) **Questions and answers**.

Regarding **listing names**: Sometimes there are **Five Vehicles**: 1) **Human**, 2) **Divine**, 3) **Śrāvaka**, 4) **Pratyekabuddha**, 5) **Bodhisattva**. Sometimes there are **Four Vehicles**—**human and divine** as one, **Three Vehicles** as three. Sometimes there are **Three Vehicles**—**human and divine lineages** only transcend the **evil destinies** but are not **supramundane vehicles**. Therefore these are not listed. Using **supramundane vehicles**, only the **Three Vehicles** are listed. Sometimes there are **Two Vehicles**: 1) **Śrāvaka Vehicle**, 2) **Pratyekabuddha Vehicle**. There is no text that speaks of "Two Vehicles" and lists **one Hīnayāna and two Mahāyāna**. Sometimes there is **One Vehicle**—in the **Buddha-lands of the ten directions**, there is only **One Vehicle dharma**, neither two nor three.

Regarding **explaining names**: The **Human Vehicle**—**human** means **benevolence**. Or the meaning of **deliberation**—[this] is named human. Because it has the meaning of **carrying and transporting**, it is called **vehicle**. The **three karmas** of **meritorious**, **non-meritorious**, and **immutable** can transport and settle [beings] in **human and divine [realms]**. Therefore it is called **Human Vehicle**. The **Divine Vehicle**—it has the meaning of **sovereignty** and **luminous purity**, therefore called **divine**. The meaning of **vehicle** is as before.

**Question:** This **Human and Divine Vehicle** is a **skillful means of the Three Vehicles** and can be included in those vehicles. Why separately establish **Five Vehicle lineages** with **human and divine** as separate?

**Answer:** Though there are **Three Vehicle lineages** existing in **human and divine [realms]**, they are included in those vehicles. The intention of establishing [them] separately now [is that] the **spiritual lineages possessed by humans and divine beings** are only **contaminated** and are **saṃsāra dharmas**. Through **non-meritorious karma** they are born in the **three evil [destinies]**; through **meritorious karma** they are born in **human and divine [realms] of the desire [realm]**. Through **immutable karma** they are born in **divine beings of the two [upper] realms, Brahmā, Indra, the Four Heavenly Kings, and Wheel-turning Monarchs**—these four types are the **ultimate fruits**. They completely lack **uncontaminated spiritual lineages of the Three Vehicles**. Therefore [these] are listed separately. If there were **supramundane uncontaminated lineages**, they would be for the **Three Vehicles**.

**Śrāvaka** means...

**Lower Section:**
...using the **sounds of teachers and friends** as conditions to attain the fruit. Or **sentient beings who hear the Buddha's Dharma-sound**. Therefore they are named **Śrāvaka**.

**Pratyekabuddha** means not relying on **teachers and friends**, seeing the **impermanence of dharmas**, using [this] as the condition to awaken to the fruit. Therefore they are called **Pratyekabuddha**.

**Bodhisattva**—**bodhi** means **bodhi** (awakening). This is called **awakening**. **Sattva** means **sattva** (sentient being), this is called **sentient being**. **Bodhi** is the **fruit to be sought**, **sattva** are the **beings to be liberated**. Therefore [they are] called **Bodhisattva**. Together they can **carry and transport**, therefore called **vehicle**.

Regarding **revealing essence**: The **five faculties of faith etc.** are the **essence of spiritual lineage**. The **five faculties** are: 1) **Faculty of faith**, 2) **Faculty of vigor**, 3) **Faculty of mindfulness**, 4) **Faculty of concentration**, 5) **Faculty of wisdom**. The **first two faculties** are **faith** and **vigor** among the **eleven wholesome [mental factors]**. The **latter three faculties** are the **latter three** among the **particular object mental factors**.

What is **faith**? Regarding **reality**, **virtue**, and **ability**, having **deep acceptance and joyful desire**, with **mental purity** as its nature. It **counteracts disbelief** and **delighting in wholesomeness** as its function.

**Vigor** means: regarding **cultivation and abandonment of wholesome and unwholesome categories**, having **courage and strength** as its nature. It **counteracts laziness** and **fulfilling wholesomeness** as its function.

What is **mindfulness**? Regarding **previously experienced objects**, causing the **mind to clearly remember without forgetting** as its nature. **Supporting concentration** as its function.

What is **concentration**? Regarding **objects of contemplation**, causing the **mind to focus without scattering** as its nature. **Supporting wisdom** as its function.

What is **wisdom**? Regarding **objects of contemplation**, **discrimination** as its nature. **Cutting doubt** as its function.

**Question:** There are **eleven wholesome [factors]**. The **Thirty Verses on Consciousness-Only** states: "**Wholesome refers to faith, shame, embarrassment, the three roots of non-greed etc., vigor, tranquility, conscientiousness, equanimity, and non-harm**."

**Question:** Why are **faith** and **vigor** taken as **spiritual lineage**?

**Answer:** Through having the **faculty of faith**, the **wholesomeness of the Five Vehicles** arises. Through having the **faculty of vigor**, the **fruits of the Three Vehicles** are accomplished. Therefore these **two** are taken—in principle all can exist.

**Question:** Do **all sentient beings** fully possess these **five faculties**?

**Answer:** [They] fully possess all [of them].

**Question:** Do all sentient beings possess these five...

There is one [king]. There are many ministers. This is also the same. What assists in accomplishing the mind's affairs is called mental factors (caitasika), therefore mental factors are many while the mind-king is only one.

Question: Why is it called "mental factors that belong to mind" (caitta dharma)?

Answer: Because of four meanings, they are called mental factors. First, they are possessed by mind. Second, they constantly arise in dependence upon mind. Third, they correspond with mind. Fourth, they are bound to mind. Therefore they are called mental factors, like a king having ministers or a person having wealth. Ministers possessed by the king, wealth possessed by a person, etc.

Question: Are the mental factors and that mind-king one or many?

Answer: The three schools explain differently. The Sarvāstivāda school holds that mind and mental factors are definitely different and not the same. The Sautrāntika school holds that mind and mental factors are definitely one without difference. The Mahāyāna says: depending on the conventional, differences are explained—not the same as the Sautrāntika school. Depending on ultimate reality, they are neither identical nor separate, like the sun and its light—not the same as the Sarvāstivāda school.

Question: Depending on the conventional means that mind and mental factors definitely have differences. When they cognize objects, what distinctions are there?

Answer: Mind only grasps the general characteristics of objects. Mental factors also grasp the particular characteristics of those same objects.

Question: What are general characteristics? What are particular characteristics?

Answer: Regarding one blue color, what the mind-king grasps is called general. The mental factor of perception (saṃjñā) grasps the particular characteristics of this. That is, one blue color serves as the general characteristic. Regarding that general characteristic, there are pleasant aspects, unpleasant aspects, and aspects that are neither. The mental factor of contact (sparśa) grasps these three aspects. Regarding the general blue object, there are also agreeable aspects, disagreeable aspects, and neutral aspects. The mental factor of feeling (vedanā) grasps these three aspects. Regarding the blue general characteristic, there are also aspects that serve as causes for verbal expression. The mental factor of perception grasps these particular characteristics. Regarding the blue general characteristic, there are correct causes, incorrect causes, and neutral cause aspects. The mental factor of volition (cetanā) grasps these three aspects. The aspects that those mental factors do not grasp are what attention (manaskāra) grasps. The mind-king only grasps that blue general characteristic. Mental factors grasp both general and particular characteristics. The other mental factors are the same as these omnipresent ones in grasping objects.

Question: Why do mental factors grasp both general and particular characteristics?

Answer: Generally, mental factors assist in accomplishing the mind's affairs. Regarding what the mind-king grasps, they grasp those particular characteristics and accomplish that function, like a painter depending on a template to fill in colors.

The Madhyāntavibhāga verse states:
"Mind and mental factors of the three realms are false discrimination. Comprehending objects in general is called mind; comprehending particulars is called mental factors."

In total there are four objections. The verse states:
"If consciousness has no real objects, then place and time determination, continuity non-determination, and function should not be established."

This is the text of one verse with four lines. Among the four lines, the first line's text restates the Mahāyāna position. The fourth line "should not be established" is the actual objection.

The first objection states: If you say there is consciousness but no real objects, then place determination should not be established. By what cause does this consciousness arise in some places and not in all places? To clarify the objection's meaning: by what conditions does consciousness of Mount Zhongnan arise at this mountain location and not arise elsewhere? Because the objects of this and other places are truly nonexistent. They establish a logical argument: [Consciousness] should arise when not cognizing Mount Zhongnan just as when cognizing it (thesis), because you maintain objects are truly nonexistent (reason), like cognizing Mount Zhongnan (example). This refers to direct perception consciousness. If it were inferential consciousness, it would also arise at this place. This is the objection about place determination.

The second objection states: Why does consciousness arise at this place at certain times and not at all times? This clarifies that time determination is not established. Since there are already no real objects yet you allow this consciousness nature, why does consciousness cognizing Mount Zhongnan location arise at one time and not at all times, when objects at other times are equally nonexistent? They establish a logical argument: [Consciousness] should arise when not cognizing Mount Zhongnan at [certain] times (thesis), because you maintain there are no real objects (reason), like when cognizing Mount Zhongnan at [certain] times (example). This also objects to direct perception consciousness, not inferential consciousness. This is the time determination objection.

The third objection states: If there are multiple continuities at the same place and time, why don't they determinately follow one consciousness arising? This is the objection about continuity non-determination. The third objection states: If consciousness has no objects and there are multiple continuities at the same place and time, there should be both those who see and those who do not see. To clarify the objection's meaning: Now regarding empty space, like a person with eye disease seeing hairs, flies, etc., this consciousness does not arise in those without eye disease. They establish a logical argument objecting: With multiple continuities at the same time interval, at one object-place, definitely one should see while others cannot see (thesis), because you maintain consciousness-only (reason), like multiple continuities at the same time interval having some who see and some who don't see flowers in space (example). This is the objection that the third line's continuity non-determination should not be established.

The fourth objection states: If consciousness has no objects, by what conditions do the hairs etc. seen by those with eye disease have no hair-functions, while other hair-objects do have functions? To clarify the objection's meaning: Like hairs and flies seen by people with diseased eyes—their substance is completely nonexistent and their functions are also nonexistent. If objects are not real, then the functions of hairs etc. seen by people without eye disease should also completely fail to be established. They establish a logical argument objecting: Hairs etc. seen by those with eye disease should have real functions (thesis), because consciousness arises though there are no real hair-objects etc. (reason), like other hairs etc. (example). This is the objection that the fourth line's functions should not be established.

Question: Seeing these four objections, they all seem reasonable. Should the established consciousness-only doctrine completely fail to be established?

Answer: Now we open the broad purport of Mahāyāna to dispel the narrow objections of Hīnayāna. Answering the four objections in general, we compose a verse:
"Place and time determination like dreams; body non-determination like ghosts seeing pus-rivers equally; like dreams, though damaged, there is function."

This one verse uses three analogies to explain the previous four objections. First answering the initial objection: Like in dreams, though there are no real objects, one sees villages, gardens, men, women and other things at certain places, not at all places. Establishing a logical argument to challenge: Your seeing villages, gardens etc. at this place in dreams should not be place-determined (thesis), because you allow dream objects are not really existent (reason), like other places not seen in dreams (example). Other unseen places, analogizing to seen places, the logical inference is also the same.

Someone objects: This logical argument's thesis has two contradictions with both common understanding and one's own school. Now you Mahāyānists already establish place determination. Worldly beings also see place determination. Why does the logical argument's thesis establish "your seeing villages, gardens etc. at this place in dreams should not be place-determined"?

Answer: By placing the word "your" we make this distinction. Having clarified this principle, we in return explain the opponent's objection with a logical argument: When not dreaming, though objects lack reality, places are also determined (thesis), because we allow objects lack reality (reason), like what is seen in dreams (example). This reason saying "allow" avoids the fallacy of unestablished [reason].

Answering the second objection: At that very place, sometimes seeing villages, gardens etc., not at all times...

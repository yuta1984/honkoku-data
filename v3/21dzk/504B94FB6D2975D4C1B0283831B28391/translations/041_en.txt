**Upper Section:**
All **dharmas arise from this**. Just as in the **form realm**, **conditioned [phenomena] initially arise gradually** and **bear the burden of all sentient beings**, this **mind is also likewise**. It can **serve as bearer and support** for the **immeasurable varieties of the five destinies**. Also, just as the **space-realm contains limitlessly**, the **great bodhicitta is also thus**. Just as **all conditioned [phenomena] throughout space are renounced**, just as **bodhi is sought and realized**, just as **sentient beings are deeply contemplated**—**arousing bodhicitta in this manner** is **difficult [to achieve] even as a single moment's inferior merit-aggregate**, how much more so the **benefits and merits of arousing mind and cultivating practice over many eons**!

**Question:** **Due to having the power of complete spiritual lineage**, one **arouses mind and cultivates practice**. If there is **no spiritual lineage**, would one **arouse such mind** and **cultivate such practice**?

**Answer:** **People without spiritual lineage** **do not arouse mind at all**. They also **do not practice**. Even if they **encounter wholesome conditions** and **arouse bodhicitta** and **cultivate bodhisattva [practices]**, these **do not become causes of bodhi** and also **do not become bodhisattva practices**.

**Question:** **By what do we know** that even if one **arouses this mind** and also **cultivates these practices**, they **do not become causes** and are also **not correct practices**?

**Answer:** The **first four [verses] of the Madhyamaka-śāstra**, **Yogācārabhūmi volume 35**, the **Bodhisattvabhūmi-sūtra**, and the **Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṃkāra** state: "**Again diligently practicing the bodhisattva path**, if one is **not originally Buddha-nature**, one **should not obtain Buddha-fruit**." The **prose commentary of the Madhyamaka-śāstra** states: "**Because of originally having no-nature**, just as **iron has no gold-nature**—even with **various forging and refining**, it **ultimately does not become gold**." **Yogācārabhūmi volume 35**, the initial **Spiritual Lineage chapter of the Holding Yoga Section**, states: "**What is called 'holding'**? Namely, **bodhisattvas' own-vehicle spiritual lineage**, **initial arousal of mind**, and **all bodhisattva-constituent dharmas**—**these are [called] holding**. **Why**? **With bodhisattvas' own-vehicle spiritual lineage** **as foundation** and **as establishment**, having **capability** and having **great power**, able to **realize unsurpassed

**Lower Section:**
**perfect enlightenment**. **Therefore**, that **own-vehicle spiritual lineage** is called the **bodhisattvas' capability-nature holding**. **With bodhisattvas' initial arousal of mind** **as foundation and establishment**, in the **six pāramitās of giving, morality, etc.**, able to **diligently cultivate merit and wisdom provisions**. **Therefore**, that **initial arousal of mind** is called the **bodhisattvas' practice and preliminary-practice holding**. **With bodhisattvas' all practiced bodhi-constituent dharmas** **as foundation and establishment**, they **perfect unsurpassed correct enlightenment**. **Therefore**, that is called the **holding of perfect great enlightenment**. **Individuals dwelling without spiritual lineage**, **because of lacking spiritual lineage**, even though they **have arousal of mind and practice of preliminary practices** **as foundation**, they are **definitely incapable of perfecting unsurpassed correct enlightenment**." The **meaning of the Holding Yoga in the treatise** has **three types of holding**: **First, spiritual lineage holding**, also called **capability-nature holding**. **Second, mind-arousal holding**, also called **practice and preliminary-practice**. **Third, bodhi-constituent holding**, also called **holding of perfect great enlightenment**. Such **three holdings** serve as **causes** for some and as **fruits** for others. **People without spiritual lineage**, already **lacking these three holdings**, how would they **obtain enlightenment**? The **text of the Bodhisattvabhūmi-sūtra** is also **the same as this text**. If so, the **Great Teacher Śākya** **established no-spiritual-lineage**, and the **future Maitreya** also **establishes thus**—**on whom can one rely to believe**? Yet do not **all sentient beings** **possess Buddha-nature**? If according to what is **stated in the Nirvāṇa Sūtra**: "**All sentient beings all have Buddha-nature** and **will attain bodhi**"—**relying on such text** to **establish the existence of Buddha-nature**—why is there **no proof-text**? **Bodhisattva Śubhagupta's Buddhabhūmi-śāstra** states: "**All sentient beings all have Buddha-nature**, **depending on true-suchness principle-nature and a small portion

**Upper Section:**
**of wisdom-nature in all**—the **Buddha made such statements**." The **treatise-master has already explained**—why not **trust and use** [this]? Also, **through four causes**, **people with spiritual lineage** **arouse bodhicitta**: **First, by seeing and hearing Buddha's spiritual powers, etc.** **Second, by hearing bodhisattva dharmas**. **Third, by seeing and hearing the decline of Buddha-dharma**, then **thinking**: "**Buddha-dharma dwelling in the world can eliminate sentient beings' great suffering-aggregates**. **I will uphold this dharma**, cause it to **dwell long in the world**, and **rescue sentient beings' suffering**." **Fourth, seeing sentient beings' confusion, shamelessness, stinginess, jealousy, worry, suffering, evil conduct, indulgence, laziness, and lack of faith** in **future eons**, then **thinking**: "**In the turbid world there is much evil**. **I should arouse mind** to cause **others to learn from me** and **generate bodhicitta**." **Through such seeing and hearing**, **such contemplation**, **thereby arousing great bodhicitta**.

**Question:** **Having aroused great bodhicitta**, **from what practices does one begin to truly cultivate**?

**Answer:** **Having already aroused mind**, one should **contemplate all present Buddhas of the ten directions**. **Formerly** they were **the same as us**, dwelling in **ordinary-being-hood**. **During limitless eons** they **first aroused mind**, **cultivated thus**, **completely perfected the causes of difficult practices**, and **already fulfilled and realized the fruits that are difficult to obtain**. **Since I am already a good woman**, why do I **belittle myself** and **not aspire for the great enlightenment fruit**? **Mahāyāna-saṃgraha, initial sixth**, states: "**Immeasurable sentient beings of the ten directions** **moment by moment have already realized the Sugata fruit**. **Since they are already great beings**, **I am also thus**—I should **not belittle myself and become discouraged**." One should also **contemplate**: "**We have also heard the bodhisattvas' teaching** that **Buddha's attained fruit is immeasurable and limitless**. Some **good great beings** having **already obtained [this], sought realization and accomplished great benefit**—**how can we**, **eyes subdued in sinfulness, wastefully rotting**, **vainly waste Buddha-nature**?" One should also **contemplate**: "**After Buddha's parinirvāṇa**, **over a thousand years have passed**, the **dharma-flavor gradually weakens**. **This dharma eliminates all worldly suffering-aggregates**. **I now arouse mind and cultivate**, **protect

**Lower Section:**
and **uphold this dharma**, cause it to **dwell long in the world**, and **rescue sentient beings' suffering**." One should also **contemplate**: "**The present time** is **the end of the semblance-dharma age**. **Sentient beings are mostly evil**. **The present time** is **the beginning of the final dharma age**. **Sentient beings have little good, wrong views flourish, and mind-arousal is difficult**. **I now arouse mind** to cause **sentient beings to learn and benefit**, causing them to **arouse mind**, **quickly turn away from birth-death**, and **swiftly approach enlightenment**."

**Question:** **Having contemplated thus**, **what practices does one cultivate**?

**Answer:** **Making offerings to the Three Jewel-field** and **offerings to the Three Jewels**—**in total there are ten types**: **First, śarīra**; **Second, caitya**; **Third, present**; **Fourth, non-present**; **Fifth, self-performed**; **Sixth, teaching others**; **Seventh, material reverence**; **Eighth, vast**; **Ninth, undefiled**; **Tenth, correct conduct offerings**.

**Question:** **Since there are already ten**, why must **all ten be complete**?

**Answer:** Though there **are ten types**, the **objects of offering** are **only two types**: **First, śarīra**—this means **body**. There is the **Buddha's dharma-body**. **Second, caitya**—this means **stupa**. There are **sacred shrines built for the Tathāgata**. **Among the eight**, the **first seven** are **material offerings**, the **last one** is **correct offering**. **Among the first seven offerings**, **first, 'present'** means **directly facing Buddha's body**, **directly approaching caitya**—called **present offerings**. **Toward all non-present Buddha stupas**, **forming Tathāgata visualization** and **forming caitya visualization**, **establishing offerings**—this is called **non-present offerings**.

**Question:** **After parinirvāṇa**, if **bodhisattvas create images** or **build caityas** and **extensively establish offerings**—**among present and non-present**, **which offerings include these**?

**Answer:** They are **included in non-present offerings**, because **Buddha has passed into parinirvāṇa**.

**Question:** **Regarding offerings**, because **Buddha has passed into parinirvāṇa**, it is acceptable [to be] **non-present**. **Among caityas**, if one **faces relics**, [they are] **Buddha's body**

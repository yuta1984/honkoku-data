Why only two? Answer: The first six have both fundamental wisdom and subsequently attained wisdom separately, but the latter four have only subsequently attained wisdom.

What are the ten serious obstacles? Answer: First is the obstacle of ordinary being nature. This refers to the discriminatively arising aspects among the two obstacles, because ordinary being nature is established based on those seeds. This is completely severed in the seeing path of the first ground. Second is the obstacle of wrong conduct. This refers to a portion of innate cognitive obstacles and the mistaken three actions arising from them. Third is the obstacle of dullness and stupidity. This refers to a portion of innate cognitive obstacles that causes the forgetting of heard, contemplated, and cultivated dharmas. Fourth is the obstacle of subtle affliction manifestation. This refers to a portion of innate cognitive obstacles such as self-view attachments that arise with the same essence, therefore establishing the name of afflictions. Fifth is the obstacle of inferior vehicle nirvana. This refers to a portion of innate cognitive obstacles that causes one to become weary of birth-death and enjoy cessation, becoming like the Two Vehicles. Sixth is the obstacle of coarse characteristics manifestation. This refers to a portion of innate cognitive obstacles that grasps at the manifestation of coarse characteristics of defilement and purity. Seventh is the obstacle of subtle characteristics manifestation. This refers to a portion of innate cognitive obstacles that grasps at the manifestation of subtle characteristics of arising and ceasing. Eighth is the obstacle of making effort in the signless. This refers to a portion of innate cognitive obstacles that prevents signless contemplation from arising spontaneously. Ninth is the obstacle of not wanting to act in benefiting others. This refers to a portion of innate cognitive obstacles that makes one unwilling to diligently practice benefiting sentient beings and prefer cultivating self-benefit. Tenth is the obstacle of not attaining mastery over all dharmas. This refers to a portion of innate cognitive obstacles that prevents one from attaining mastery over all dharmas.

Question: What are the ten suchnesses? Answer: First is universal suchness, second is supreme suchness, third is excellent flow suchness, fourth is non-appropriation suchness, fifth is no-difference in category suchness, sixth is no defilement-purity suchness, seventh is no-difference in dharmas suchness, eighth is no increase-decrease suchness, ninth is suchness as basis for wisdom mastery,

Tenth is suchness as basis for karmic mastery. Question: If the nature of nirvana's suchness is one nirvana dharma realm without differences, why make it ten? Answer: Although nirvana's suchness nature actually has no differences, ten types are provisionally established according to excellent virtues. Question: The nirvana suchness realized in the first ground is called universal, but how does nirvana suchness have ten more distinctions? Answer: Although one already comprehends everything in the first ground, the capacity to realize is not yet perfect. To make it perfect, subsequent establishments are made, therefore there are separately ten.

Question: When such bodhisattvas courageously cultivate the ten excellent practices, sever the ten serious obstacles, and realize the ten nirvanas in the ten grounds, what difference does this make? Answer: It is to realize the two transformations of the basis. Question: What are the two transformations of the basis? Answer: First is the transforming basis, second is the transformed basis. The transforming basis has two: first is the subduing path, second is the severing path. The transformed basis has two: first is the seed-holding basis. This means the root consciousness can hold seeds, therefore it is the basis for everything. The noble path transforms it to abandon defilement and attain purity, therefore it is called transformation of the basis. Second is the basis of delusion and awakening. This means suchness is the nature of all dharmas, therefore it is the basis for everything. The noble path transforms it to abandon defilement and attain purity, therefore it is called transformation of the basis. These two types are called the two transformations of the basis. When the verse states "thereby realizes and attains transformation of the basis," this refers to the fruit of these two transformations of the basis.

Question: What are the characteristics of the fifth, the ultimate stage? Answer: The root verse of Consciousness-Only states: "This is the uncontaminated realm, inconceivable, good, permanent, blissful liberation body. The great sage is called Dharma." The transformation of the basis attained in the previous cultivation stage is the characteristic of this ultimate stage. This refers to the fruit of the previous two transformations of the basis. This is included in the ultimate uncontaminated realm. All contaminations are permanently exhausted, and the nature is pure and

perfectly luminous, therefore it is called uncontaminated. "Realm" means repository, because it contains great merits within. Or it means cause, because it can generate beneficial and blissful matters for the five vehicles.

Question: Why is it called inconceivable? Answer: Because it transcends the path of discursive thought and conceptual discussion.

Question: Why is it called good? Answer: Because it is the nature of pure dharmas. The pure dharma realm is distant from arising and ceasing, extremely peaceful, therefore. The four wisdom mind-groups have wonderful functions without limitations, extremely skillful, therefore. Both are called good.

Question: Why is it called permanent? Answer: Because there is no time limit. The pure dharma realm has no arising or ceasing, its nature has no change, therefore it is called permanent. The four wisdom mind-groups, because their basis is permanent and because they are never cut off, are also called permanent.

Question: That the pure dharma realm is called permanent is indeed so. Why are the four wisdom mind-groups called permanent? Answer: Because they are never cut off, they are also called permanent, but they are not inherently permanent.

Question: Why are they not inherently permanent dharmas? Answer: Because they arise from causes. What arises returns to cessation—this is categorically stated. No form or mind is seen to be non-impermanent. Due to these three reasons, they are not permanently abiding. Making a logical inference: "The four wisdom mind-groups should not be permanent" (thesis). "Because they arise from causes" (reason). "Like other conditioned phenomena" (example). "The four wisdom mind-groups should not be permanent" (thesis). "Because what arises necessarily ceases—this is categorically stated" (reason). "Like other minds, etc." (example). "The four wisdom mind-groups should not be permanent" (thesis). "Because no form or mind is seen to be non-impermanent" (reason). "Like other minds, etc." (example). The Nirvana Sutra says: "Permanent dharmas have no cognition, like empty space. The Tathagata has cognition, therefore is impermanent." To clarify the meaning: "permanent dharmas have no cognition" refers to the pure dharma realm, the principle dharma-body Buddha. This is inherently permanent without change. "The Tathagata has cognition, therefore is impermanent" means the four wisdom mind-groups are called "having cognition," and because they have cognition, they are considered impermanent. Also it says: "The Tathagata, World-Honored One, is neither permanently abiding nor momentarily ceasing." To clarify the meaning: the four wisdom mind-groups are not permanently abiding, the pure dharma realm does not momentarily cease. The Nirvana Sutra says: "If one says the Tathagata is impermanent, one's tongue will fall out." What does this mean? When Shakyamuni Tathagata entered nirvana between the twin trees, if sentient beings see the paramitas and say the Buddha is impermanent, that person's tongue will fall out. Because this is a manifestation, it is not impermanent. There is momentary cessation but no interruption, always present on Vulture Peak. However, in reality there is no death and the tongue root does not decay.

Briefly revealing the gate of perfect cause and complete fruit. Because the cause of the ten grounds is already perfect and the fruit of the three bodies is complete, it is called perfect cause and complete fruit.

Question: Among the sequential stages of cultivation there are five sequential stages. Which stages are considered cause and which stage is considered fruit? Answer: Among the five stages, the first four stages are cause stages, and the latter one stage is the fruit stage.

Question: If so, having explained the five stages with cause and fruit already completed, why is there additionally this gate? Answer: In the cause of the ten grounds, one severs the ten serious obstacles, eliminates the twenty-two delusions, and cultivates the ten excellent practices and ten suchnesses. This is what is accomplished in the cause stage. In the fruit of the three bodies, there are four nirvanas, four arising categories, Buddha-land meanings, and also one hundred forty exclusive dharmas, etc. Now clarifying these dharmas as the complete fruit, therefore there is a separate gate.

Question: What are the three bodies in this complete fruit? Answer: First is the transformation body, second is the response body, third is the dharma body. These are called the three bodies. According to the Treatise on Buddha Lands, Consciousness-Only treatises, etc., first is the self-nature body, second is the enjoyment

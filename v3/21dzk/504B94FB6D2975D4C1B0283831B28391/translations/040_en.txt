become **uncontaminated**. Therefore **uncontaminated dharmas** are **not without causeless nature**. Namely, the **Mahāsāṃghika**, **Ekavyāvahārika**, **Lokottaravāda**, **Kaukkuṭika**, etc., are called **Vibhajyavādins**. They **establish inherent Buddha-nature** and **take mind as the original nature**. Now we refute this, saying: When you say "mind," do you **call the emptiness-principle "mind"**? Or do you **call the cognizing mind "mind"**? If you **call the emptiness-principle of mind "mind"**, why do you **take that emptiness-principle as the cause of original lineage seeds**? **Emptiness-principle** serves as **the foundation for dharmas** and is **not causation**. If it is **cognizing mind**, in the **ordinary being stage**, it **exists only as contaminated**. How does it **produce the uncontaminated**? If it is **contaminated yet becomes uncontaminated**, it could **produce contaminated dharmas**. If the **Sarvāstivāda masters** [say there is] **no original Buddha-nature**, how do they **produce Buddha-fruit**? If **during cultivation**, **Buddha-nature is just produced**, since [they say] there is **already no-nature**, why does it **just now arise**? If **previously there was none and now there is**, then **now there is and later there is none**—namely, **there is no Buddha-fruit**. If **during cultivation**, **from what does it arise**? You **establish that dharma-essence eternally exists**—is **Buddha-nature dharma-essence not eternally existing**? **Where is dharma-essence** that it **becomes cultivated nature**?

Through **much wholesome speech and much hearing-perfuming power**, there is **entry into the path of seeing**. At the **beginning of such path of seeing**, **uncontaminated wisdom newly perfumes its own seeds**. **This perfumed seed exists** and is called **habituation-accomplished spiritual lineage**.

**Question:** Previously **cultivating contaminated much hearing-perfuming**, why are **the perfumed seeds** not called **habituation**?

**Answer:** [They are] **conventional designations** and **not true spiritual lineage**. **Because [they are] contaminated**, they **do not become Buddha-nature**.

**Question:** Do these **two types of spiritual lineage**, both being **uncontaminated wholesome**, **depend upon the contaminated eighth [consciousness]**?

**Answer:** **Because [it is] contaminated**, it **does not become [their] self-essence**. **Only through storing** is it called **"dependence"**.

**Question:** That **eighth consciousness**, **from beginningless [time]** until the **completion of the seventh stage**, is called **ālayavijñāna**. **From the completion of the tenth stage** until the **end of the tenth stage**, it is called **vipākavijñāna**. Why do **uncontaminated seeds** get **stored by it**?

**Answer:** This is **contaminated** and also **karmic maturation**. Yet **in one lifetime**, this is the **true substantial self-essence of realm-destiny birth**, having **birth without interruption**, therefore it **serves as holder**.

**Question:** If so, can that **holder-consciousness** **cognize those seeds**?

**Answer:** In the **contaminated stage**, it **cannot cognize** [them].

**Question:** Why does it **hold [them] itself** yet **not cognize them**?

**Answer:** The **holder-consciousness** is **only contaminated**. The **held seeds** are **only uncontaminated**. **Contaminated and uncontaminated** have **already different essences**, therefore it **does not cognize** [them].

**Question:** If the **holder-consciousness cannot cognize them**, wouldn't this be **non-vijñapti-mātra mind-object**?

**Answer:** Though it **does not cognize them**, it **can hold [them]**, therefore it is **not [non-]mind**.

**Question:** The **holder eighth consciousness** **cognizes three types of objects**: **First, faculties and faculty-supports**; **Second, external vessel-world**; **Third, seeds of all dharmas**. Since it **cognizes seeds**,

**Upper Section:**
why does it **not cognize uncontaminated seeds**?

**Answer:** **Because their natures are each different**, it **does not cognize the uncontaminated**.

**Question:** The **holder eighth consciousness** is **only of neutral nature**. The **held seeds** **eliminate neutral, wholesome, and unwholesome**—does it **not cognize these**?

**Answer:** Those **neutral, wholesome, and unwholesome** are **equally contaminated** and **equally birth-death dharmas**, therefore it **cognizes those**. **Uncontaminated wholesome dharmas** are **not birth-death dharmas**, therefore it **cannot cognize them**.

**Question:** **Vijñapti-mātra has five types**: **First, consciousness self-characteristic vijñapti-mātra**; **Second, consciousness-associated vijñapti-mātra**; **Third, consciousness-transformed vijñapti-mātra**; **Fourth, consciousness-states vijñapti-mātra**; **Fifth, consciousness true-nature vijñapti-mātra**. Now **uncontaminated seeds**—**within these five types**, **which vijñapti-mātra includes them**?

**Answer:** **Consciousness self-characteristic vijñapti-mātra**—**because [they are] seeds of uncontaminated consciousness self-characteristics**. Also **consciousness-transformed vijñapti-mātra**—**because [they are] types of transformations**.

**Question:** **Good men and women** who **possess such two types of spiritual lineage**—how do they **arouse [bodhicitta]**?

**Answer:** **Washing and purifying**, **approaching stupas and monasteries**, **before Buddha images**, **separately before bodhisattva images**, **separately arousing earnest pure body**, performing **excellent veneration and praise**, **respectful offerings**, **petitioning those with wisdom, practice, and knowledge**: "**For the sentient beings of the dharmadhātu**, I **aspire for unsurpassed bodhi**. That **bodhi is without illness, without heat and afflictions**—may **the Venerable One among those who have arisen** **listen and permit**. **At that time, O Arising and Obtaining One**, **O Good Great Hero**, **arouse great compassionate mind**, **generate great loving mind**, **cause [me] to arouse that mind** and **cause [me] to cultivate that practice**." The words state: "**May I definitely** **attain unsurpassed perfect enlightenment**, **be able to accomplish all benefits for sentient beings**, **ultimately establish [them]** in **perfect nirvāṇa** and in the **Buddha's vast wisdom**." **Arousing the Four Great Vows**: "**Though birth-death is limitless, I will definitely cut [through it]**; **though sentient beings are numberless, I will definitely save [them]**; **though vows are immeasurable, I will definitely cultivate [them]**; **though Buddha-fruit is inexhaustible, I will definitely realize [it]**." Also **arousing the Ten Great Vow-minds**:

**To manifest the Buddha's ten powers and fearlessnesses**, I **arouse bodhicitta**.

Also **generating ten types of great compassionate mind**:

**Observing sentient beings as without refuge and without rescue**, [I] **generate great compassionate mind**.

**Observing sentient beings' natures as unharmonious and disobedient**, [I] **generate great compassionate mind**.

**Observing sentient beings as poor and without wholesome roots**, [I] **generate great compassionate mind**.

**Observing sentient beings practicing unwholesome dharmas**, [I] **generate great compassionate mind**.

**Observing sentient beings sleeping through the long night**, [I] **generate great compassionate mind**.

**Observing sentient beings bound by desire-bonds**, [I] **generate great compassionate mind**.

**Observing sentient beings submerged in the ocean of birth-death**, [I] **generate great compassionate mind**.

**Observing sentient beings long afflicted by illness and suffering**, [I] **generate great compassionate mind**.

**Observing sentient beings without desire for wholesome dharmas**, [I] **generate great compassionate mind**.

**Observing sentient beings losing the Buddha-dharmas**, [I] **generate great compassionate mind**.

**Practitioners** who **wish to realize bodhi** and **create great benefit** should **truly first arouse this bodhicitta and compassionate mind**. Just as **when the great ocean first has one drop**, it **can serve as a dwelling place for all jewels**, the **initial arousing of mind** is **also like this**. **Five Vehicle wholesome** [dharmas]...

He-karishidzaiten (Other-Transformation-Bliss Heaven). Such detailed interpretations are extensive, so I stop here.

Having already clarified the two realms of humans and heavenly beings above, the remaining three evil realms and eight difficult places have not yet had their characteristics explained. Now I will explain them. First, let me clarify the hell realm. Below this Jambudvipa there are eight hot great hells: 1) Sañjīva Hell (Equal-Living Hell), 2) Kālasūtra Hell (Black-Line Hell), 3) Saṃghāta Hell (Crushing Hell), 4) Raurava Hell (Screaming Hell), 5) Mahāraurava Hell (Great Screaming Hell), 6) Tapana Hell (Burning Hell), 7) Pratāpana Hell (Great Burning Hell), and 8) Avīci Hell (Uninterrupted Hell).

Question: How are these eight hells arranged?
Answer: From this human world's ground, descending past 32,000 yojanas, there is the Equal-Living Hell. From this Equal-Living Hell, descending past 4,000 yojanas, there is the Black-Line Hell. From here, descending 2,000 yojanas, there is the Crushing Hell. From here downward are five hells, each separated by 2,000 yojanas downward. These eight hells are all 10,000 yojanas wide. The Uninterrupted Hell is 128,000 yojanas deep from this ground level. Mount Sumeru enters the water 84,000 yojanas, but this surpasses that by 42,000 yojanas. The distance between Equal-Living Hell and Uninterrupted Hell totals 48,000 yojanas. For brevity, I stop here.

Besides these, there are also eight cold hells: 1) Arbuda Hell (Blister Hell), 2) Nirarbuda Hell (Burst Blister Hell), 3) Aṭaṭa Hell, 4) Hahava Hell, 5) Huhuva Hell, 6) Utpala Hell (Blue Lotus Hell), 7) Padma Hell (Red Lotus Hell), and 8) Mahāpadma Hell (Great Red Lotus Hell). From this ground level, descending 32,000 yojanas, there is the Blister Hell. From here, separated by 2,000 yojanas each downward, are the remaining seven hells. These cold hells are also each 10,000 yojanas wide. All such hells exist because beings in this human world created evil karma and fell to receive suffering.

The causal relationships, distinctions in names, and characteristics of the suffering endured can be seen in detail in the Yogācārabhūmi and other sūtras. Having clarified the dwelling places of the hell realm, next I clarify the dwelling places of the hungry ghost realm. Directly below the southern edge of this Southern Continent (Jambudvipa), descending past a depth of 500 yojanas, is the capital of King Yama. Its length and width are also 500 yojanas. This capital serves as the main dwelling place for hungry ghosts, and they are scattered throughout other places as well.

Question: Is this King Yama also of the ghost realm?
Answer: He is included in the ghost realm.
Question: Then why is he called the Dharma King?
Answer: Because he can benefit all sentient beings, he is named Dharma King.
Question: How does he benefit them?
Answer: When sentient beings are brought before the king, in order to make them remember, he manifests a body similar to theirs and tells them: "You should receive the karmic results of the actions you yourselves created." Through this cause and condition, these sentient beings each understand their own created karma and receive the results themselves.

Question: There are messengers of King Yama - what kind of people are these?
Answer: They arise from the superior power of sentient beings' karma, like transformations, and are not sentient beings.
Question: Do people born in hell remember past lives or not remember them?
Answer: Some remember and some do not. If there are sentient beings who do not remember past lives, King Yama immediately teaches and instructs them, enabling them to remember.
Question: What kind of sentient beings remember past lives in hell, and what kind cannot remember?
Answer: Three types of people cannot remember: 1) Extremely foolish people, namely those born in borderlands; 2) Extremely indulgent people, namely those who receive desires; 3) Extremely wrong-viewed people, namely those who slander cause and effect. The king makes such people remember, generates minds of shame and remorse, and frees them from hell's suffering.

Having briefly shown the separate dwelling characteristics of the ghost realm, next I clarify where asuras dwell. There are five categories: 1) The extremely weak ones now dwell in mountains and lands of the human world. In the great mountains of this western land, there are great deep caves, which are mostly dwelling places of asuras. 2) Under the great ocean north of Mount Sumeru, 21,000 yojanas down, is an asura palace where Rāhu Asura dwells. Next, 21,000 yojanas down is also an asura palace where Vīra Asura dwells. Next, 21,000 yojanas down is also an asura palace where Puspamalya Asura dwells. Next, 21,000 yojanas down is an asura palace where King Vemacitra Asura dwells. According to this, going down 84,000 yojanas is deeper than Mount Sumeru. When there are discrepancies between the text of the起世経 (Qishijing) and this commentary, later students should examine them. The thirty-six places of the desire realm have been briefly clarified.

Question: Where do beings of the animal realm dwell?
Answer: There are three dwelling places: earth, water, and air. They intermingle with human and heavenly realms without separate dependent places.

Next, explaining the characteristics of the form realm: The form realm is named "form realm" because it is the basis separated from desire. The detailed meaning is as before. The form realm has four dhyānas and eighteen heavenly places. The first dhyāna has three heavens: Brahmakāyika Heaven, Brahmapurohita Heaven, and Mahābrahmā Heaven. Because they are owned, transformed, and ruled by Mahābrahmā, they are named Brahmakāyika. Because they stand in rows as attendants before Mahābrahmā, they are named Brahmapurohita. Because they arise from extensive goodness, they are named Brahmā Heaven. This Brahmā is great, so it is named Mahābrahmā. Because he obtains the intermediate concentration, he is first to be born and last to die, having superior威德, so he is named Mahābrahmā. Being luminous, pure, and sovereign, they are collectively called heaven. Dhyāna means dhyāna, which is called "calm contemplation."

The second dhyāna has three heavens: Parīttābha Heaven (Little Light), Apramāṇābha Heaven (Immeasurable Light), and Ābhāsvara Heaven (Pure Light). Within their own ground, their light is the least, so they are named Little Light. Their brightness becomes superior and difficult to measure, so they are named Immeasurable Light. Pure light pervades everywhere in their ground, so they are named Pure Light.

The third dhyāna has three heavens: Parīttaśubha Heaven (Little Purity), Apramāṇaśubha Heaven (Immeasurable Purity), and Śubhakṛtsna Heaven (Pervading Purity). Within their own ground, this purity is the least, so they are named Little Purity. This purity increases and is difficult to measure, so they are named Immeasurable Purity. This purity is universally pervasive, so they are named Pervading Purity.

The fourth dhyāna has nine heavens: Anabhraka Heaven (Cloudless), Puṇyaprasava Heaven (Merit-born), Bṛhatphala Heaven (Great Fruit), Asaññasatta Heaven (Non-perception), Avṛha Heaven (No Affliction), Atapa Heaven (No Heat), Sudṛśa Heaven (Good Appearance), Sudarśana Heaven (Good Vision), and Akaniṣṭha Heaven (Ultimate Form). Initially departing from clouds, it is named Cloudless. Merit becomes superior, so it is named Merit-born. Among ordinary beings, their merit is most superior, so it is named Great Fruit. These three heavens are mixed dwellings of ordinary and noble beings. Because they are disgusted with perception and obtain birth in that heaven, it is named Non-perception. This one heaven is solely a dwelling place for ordinary beings. From here upward are five heavenly places named Pure Abodes. These are solely dwelling places for noble beings. Noble beings free from desire wash away the defilements of afflictions with the water of the path, so it is named pure. It is the dwelling place of pure bodies, so it is named Pure Abodes. These heavenly places are purely where noble ones abide. "Affliction" means complexity or extensiveness. Among those without complexity, this is the first, so it is named No Affliction. Afflictions arising in lower grounds are named "heat." This...

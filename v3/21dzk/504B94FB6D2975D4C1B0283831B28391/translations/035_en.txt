...included in the first three [realms]. Because it is not included in the eye [faculty]. [Reason] Like bottles and water. [Example]

The Mahāyāna proponent constructs an **indefiniteness fallacy** saying: "That extremely established form, like eye-consciousness, is self-accepted as included in the first three. Because it is not included in the eye, is it not a form that does not separate from eye-consciousness? Or like self-accepted Buddha-forms in other realms, self-accepted as included in the first three and not included in the eye - is that extremely established form non-separate from eye-consciousness yet still form?"

To prevent such [arguments], the term "self-accepted" is placed.

**Question:** Why does that Sarvāstivāda master say "[something] does not separate from eye-consciousness yet is not form, etc."?

**Answer:** That opponent, the Hīnayāna Sarvāstivādin, says: "When eye-consciousness perceives form, eye-consciousness has an aspect resembling form. Like the perceived-aspect (相分) in Mahāyāna. This is merely not the characteristics of form-mind. Therefore it is said 'does not separate from eye-consciousness but is not form.'"

**Question:** Given that the term "self-accepted" prevents later fallacies, what does "included in the first three" mean?

**Answer:** The eighteen elements (dhātu) are grouped as **"six threes"** - that is, 3×6=18.

**Question:** What are the "six threes"?

**Answer:** 
1. Eye-element, form-element, eye-consciousness-element
2. Ear-element, sound-element, ear-consciousness-element  
3. Nose-element, fragrance-element, nose-consciousness-element
4. Tongue-element, taste-element, tongue-consciousness-element
5. Body-element, touch-element, body-consciousness-element
6. Mind-element, dharma-element, mind-consciousness-element

These constitute the "six threes." "Included in the first three" refers to inclusion in the first three among the six threes. "Eye-element" refers to the eye-faculty. "Form-element" refers to form grasped by the faculty. "Eye-consciousness-element" refers to eye-consciousness itself.

**Lower Section:**
The text explains why elements (dhātu) are so called - because they "uphold" or "maintain." Different masters offer various explanations:
- **Zhen Master**: Function upholds substance
- **Fan Master**: Substance upholds substance  
- **Ji Master**: Consciousness-substance upholds its own characteristics

**Xinluo Heung** judges that **Master Ji's explanation is correct**.

The discussion then addresses why in the **"first three,"** the argument establishes that **form-objects** (境) "do not separate from consciousness," but does not establish that **faculties** (根) "do not separate from consciousness":

**Answer:** Faculties are **cause**, consciousness is **effect**. Cause-effect relationships definitely neither merge nor separate. Therefore faculties are not established as "not separating from consciousness." Although objects are also cause and consciousness effect, **objects are transformations of consciousness** - they exist **within mind**. Faculties, as **supporting bases**, are **not mental transformations** and exist **outside mind**. Hence the different treatment.

**Upper Section:**
The text criticizes Heung's judgment and provides Master Ji's two interpretations of why consciousness is called an "element."

It then addresses **logical classification** in Buddhist logic (因明): everything must be classified as either **similar instances** (同品) or **dissimilar instances** (異品). The eye-faculty serves as a **dissimilar instance** because, while it has a cause-effect relationship with consciousness (neither merging nor separating), it lacks the **"absolutely non-separate"** characteristic that defines the thesis.

**Lower Section:**
The text explains why **both qualifications** - **"included in the first three"** AND **"not included in the eye [faculty]"** - are necessary in the logical argument. Without "not included in the eye," **three fallacies** arise:

1. **Indefiniteness fallacy** (不定過): The argument becomes ambiguous
2. **Contradiction with dharma's own characteristics** (法自相相違過)  
3. **Definite contradiction fallacy** (決定相違過)

**Example of indefiniteness:** "Is extremely established form, because it's included in the first three like eye-consciousness, non-separate from eye-consciousness? Or because it's included in the first three like the eye-faculty, is extremely established form actually separate from eye-consciousness?"

**Example of dharma-characteristic contradiction:** "Thesis: Extremely established form truly does not separate from eye-consciousness. Reason: Because included in the first three. Example: Like the eye-faculty."

The text notes these may be **pseudo-fallacies** rather than genuine logical errors, leaving the determination to later scholars.

...consciousness? Or like the five threes, because it is not included in the eye [faculty], does it separate from eye-consciousness? Therefore this problem exists. Using the **superior doctrine of Mahāyāna**, how does one distinguish the truth and prevent contradicting the fallacies of scholars?

**Answer:** That Hīnayāna scholar, using his own Hīnayāna doctrine, considers form to be separate. If one raises the **superior truth of Mahāyāna**, one immediately understands the superior doctrine of Mahāyāna. Therefore it does not contradict.

**Question:** Using the **ultimate truth** (paramārtha-satya) to distinguish the truth, how does it not contradict non-scholars?

**Answer:** That is to say, it exists in characteristics and is ultimate truth; therefore the thesis states that characteristics are separate. Through conventional usage one understands thus, so it does not contradict them. Therefore raising the **two truths** has profound reasons.

**Question:** The **superior doctrine of Mahāyāna** is what those Hīnayāna [scholars] do not accept. How can one use that doctrine to distinguish contradictions?

**Answer:** [The thesis] that **Mahāyāna sutras are Buddha's teachings** has been established. Through **Maitreya's seven reasons** and **Yogācāra's five reasons**, [this] has been completed. Therefore the superior doctrine has become commonly accepted.

**Question:** If so, using the doctrine that objects do not separate [from consciousness] was already established before. Establishing it again now would be the **fallacy of already established**.

**Answer:** There are **four types of reasoning** (yukti): 1) **Natural reasoning** (dharmatā-yukti), 2) **Dependent reasoning** (apekṣā-yukti), 3) **Functional reasoning** (kārya-kāraṇa-yukti), 4) **Evidential reasoning** (upapatti-sādhana-yukti). The first three established through reasoning that mind grasps the internal. Now using **evidential reasoning** to establish [it], therefore it's not the fallacy of already established.

**Question:** What does that evidential reasoning mean?

**Answer:** Using premises to establish the conclusion—this is evidential reasoning. Carefully establishing it can be accomplished through instruction.

**Question:** For the fallacy of non-scholars who don't understand ultimate [truth], what is the distinguishing [principle]?

**Answer:** I, using non-scholarship, follow conventional flow. Understanding through superior principles, it can be thus, so it doesn't contradict. In that border country of **Silla**, there was **Master Sungyeong** who constructed the **definite contradiction fallacy**. He entrusted the fallacy to his disciple **Master Ryeong-yu** who went to **Ci'en Temple** in the **Great Tang**...

...and presented it to **Master Dacheng Ji** (Kuiji). The contradictory statement said: "**Truly, extremely established form definitely separates from eye-consciousness** [Thesis]. **Because it is self-accepted as included in the first three and not included in the eye** [Reason]. **Like the eye-faculty** [Example]."

**Master Dacheng Ji** said: "The **thesis-basis** is commonly accepted, but the **reason uses a self-reason**, and the **example has the fallacy of unestablished conclusion**."

**Question:** Why is the thesis-basis commonly accepted?
**Answer:** Because there is the term "extremely established," it is commonly accepted.

**Question:** Why does it use a self-reason?
**Answer:** That extremely established form is not included in eye-consciousness—this is what you alone assert. In our **Mahāyāna school**, form is precisely the **perceived-aspect** (nimitta-bhāga) of eye-consciousness. What could not be included? There is the **fallacy of non-establishment for one party**. That the eye-faculty separates from eye-consciousness is what you alone accept. [But] Mahāyāna establishes that ear-faculty is cause, consciousness is effect—they neither merge nor separate. Why don't you [accept] this? There is the **fallacy of unestablished conclusion**.

**Question:** Does this **consciousness-only syllogism** have its **original syllogism** in sutras and śāstras?

**Answer:** There are **six sutras and eleven treatises**. [The text] still establishes the syllogism. However, in the **seventh volume of the treatise**, one sutra is quoted as the foundation. The **Ghanavyūha Sūtra** verse states: "*The objects of mind, mentality, and consciousness all do not separate from self-nature. Therefore I teach that everything is consciousness-only, nothing else.*"

Based on this scriptural passage, the **seventh volume of the treatise** establishes syllogisms: "**Extremely established eye-consciousness etc.**, because they are one of the five, like others, do not intimately perceive forms etc. separate from themselves. **Other consciousnesses**, because they are consciousness, like **eye-consciousness etc.**, also do not intimately perceive dharmas separate from themselves. **These intimate objects of perception** definitely do not separate from this, because they are one of two, like **that which perceives**. **Objects of perception**, like **associated dharmas**, definitely do not separate from **mind and mental factors**."

**Master Ci'en** said: "These are **four syllogisms**. The **first general syllogism** states: **Extremely established eye-consciousness etc. do not intimately perceive forms etc. separate from themselves** [Thesis]. **Because they are one of the five** [Reason]. **Example: Like others** [Example]." What this reveals is: among the five...

...consciousnesses, taking one eye-consciousness, therefore saying "extremely established eye" to distinguish what is not commonly accepted. In **Mahāyāna school** there are **Buddha's eye-consciousnesses in other realms**. In **Hīnayāna school**, **Buddha's undefiled eye-consciousness** and **final-birth bodhisattvas' unwholesome eye-consciousness** are not extremely established by both self and others. Therefore the term "extremely established" is used.

"**Not intimately perceiving forms etc. of eye-consciousness separate from itself**"—this term "intimate perception" distinguishes **forms external to one's own mind in other bodies** and **original objects** transformed by the **eighth consciousness etc.** for eye-consciousness. These are also **indirect objects of perception**.

In the reason, "**because they are one of the five consciousnesses**"—this treatise text is abbreviated. [It means] "**like the other four consciousnesses of ear etc.**" The **ear etc. four consciousnesses**, because they are included as one among the five consciousnesses, do not intimately perceive **forms separate from themselves**. "**Forms separate from self**" means they are objects of eye-consciousness. **Ear etc.** only perceive **sounds etc. not separate from themselves**.

Thus the **remaining four consciousnesses**, mutually compared, have **four syllogisms** likewise.

The **second syllogism** states: "**Other consciousnesses also do not intimately perceive dharmas separate from themselves** [Thesis]. **Because they are consciousness** [Reason]. **Like eye-consciousness etc.** [Example]." The term "extremely established" applies here. The **seventh and eighth consciousnesses** are not established by others. [We] call **the sixth consciousness** "**the remainder of the five consciousnesses**." If we separately stated "**the sixth**," [we] would immediately fear others using the **seventh and eighth consciousnesses** as an **indefiniteness fallacy**. Therefore we just generally say "remainder," separately taking **the sixth**, with the meaning including **the seventh and eighth** also within.

Like **eye-consciousness etc.**, [they] also do not intimately perceive **dharmas separate from themselves**. Therefore [they serve] as examples. This means perceiving objects **not separate from one's own consciousness** as objects.

The **third syllogism** states: "**The intimate objects of perception of these six consciousnesses definitely do not separate from these six consciousnesses** [Thesis]. **Because they are included as one among the two aspects of perceiver and perceived** [Reason]. **Like that perceiving seeing-aspect** [Example]." The **seeing-aspect** does not separate from consciousness—it is precisely...

**Lower Section:**
...the **function of consciousness**, therefore serving as a **functional example**.

The **fourth syllogism** states: "**All conditioned and unconditioned [dharmas] that are merely objects of perception definitely do not separate from consciousness** [Thesis]. **Because they are objects of perception** [Reason]. **Like associated dharmas** [Example]." **Associated dharmas** are objects of perception in essence.

Also: "**All objects of perception of one's own consciousness definitely do not separate from my perceiving mind and mental factors** [Thesis]. **Because they are objects of perception** [Reason]. **Like associated dharmas** [Example]."

**Question:** Among these four syllogisms, which one serves as the **original consciousness-only syllogism**?

**Answer:** Explicitly [it] depends on the **latter two**, but in principle [it] encompasses **all four syllogisms**.

**Question:** In the commentary text it says: "**The sixth consciousness** is the remainder of the five consciousnesses. If we separately stated '**the sixth**,' we would immediately fear [others] using the **seventh and eighth consciousnesses** as an **indefiniteness fallacy**. We just generally say 'remainder,' separately taking **the sixth**, with the meaning including **the seventh and eighth** also within." How do the **seventh and eighth** become an indefiniteness fallacy?

**Answer:** [The indefiniteness would be:] Like **eye-consciousness etc.**, because they are consciousness, does the **sixth consciousness** not intimately perceive **dharmas separate from itself**? Or like **your seventh and eighth**, because they are consciousness, does the **sixth consciousness** intimately perceive **dharmas separate from itself**?

**Question:** Who accepts that the **seventh and eighth** perceive **dharmas separate from themselves**? How is this indefinite?

**Answer:** The **seventh and eighth consciousnesses** have not yet established that they perceive **dharmas not separate from themselves**, therefore [they] become indefinite.

**Question:** Regarding those **seventh and eighth**, [we] are now about to establish that [they] perceive **dharmas not separate from themselves**. How do those two become indefinite?

**Answer:** After establishment there is no indefiniteness fallacy; before establishment there is still indefiniteness.

**Question:** In the **subject** (dharmin) of the thesis, including the **seventh and eighth**, the **Hīnayāna** does not accept [them]—isn't this **unestablished subject**? How does one escape that fallacy? Also the **partial non-establishment for one party fallacy** in the reason—how is this avoided?

**Answer:** Because [they] are not explicitly stated in words, there is no such fallacy. In **implicit acceptance**, how could there be such fallacies? The reason's **non-establishment for one party** is also likewise. In the **Central Indian region**, **Magadha**...

"Cai" refers to Ratnākara, and Jingming (Pure Name) is Vimalakīrti. Master Dōeki agrees with this. Some say: Baogai (Jewel Canopy) refers to Elder Ratnaketu, and Fa (Dharma) refers to Elder Dharmarakṣa. Some say: Bao (Jewel) refers to Elder Ratnākara, who offered a canopy to the Buddha, hence named Jewel Canopy. Fa Jingming (Dharma Pure Name) refers to Vimalakīrti. Fa (Dharma) means standard or rule, namely the dharma he understood. Jing (Pure) means stainless. Ming (Name) means reputation. This means this householder extensively understood all dharmas, had no defilements of afflictions, and his reputation was heard throughout the ten directions.

Sūtra: At that time King Prasenajit, using his spiritual power, created 80,000 kinds of music. The eighteen Brahmā heavens and six desire [realm] heavens also created 80,000 kinds of music. The sound moved the three-thousand [world system], extending to the ten powers and Ganges sands of Buddha lands. Where there are conditions, it manifests. From those other Buddha lands, Bodhisattva Dharma-spear from the south with 500 million great assemblies came together to enter this great assembly. Bodhisattva Jewel-pillar from the east with 900 million great assemblies came together to enter this great assembly. Bodhisattva Ākāśa-nature from the north with 11 billion great assemblies came together to enter this great assembly. Bodhisattva善住 from the west with ten Ganges sands of great assemblies came together to enter this great assembly. The six directions were likewise, making music similarly, and together creating immeasurable music to awaken the Tathāgata.

The new version says: King Prasenajit, receiving the Buddha's spiritual power, extensively created music. The gods of desire and form realms each played immeasurable divine musical instruments. The sound pervaded the three-thousand great-thousand world system. At that time the World-Honored One again emitted immeasurable, countless lights. The illumination was of mixed colors, and in each light appeared jeweled lotus flowers. Each flower had a thousand petals, all golden in color. Above were transformation Buddhas proclaiming essential dharma teachings. This Buddha's light universally manifested in the ten directions' Ganges sand Buddha lands where there were conditions. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: The third "awakening the Tathāgata" has three parts: first, this realm creates music; next, other realms create music; finally, they jointly create music. Master Jizang says: Even entering the second dhyāna, one is not moved by sounds.

Now saying "awakening the Tathāgata" clarifies that the Buddha has responsive conditions. 

Sūtra: The Buddha immediately knew the time, obtained [knowledge of] sentient beings' faculties, immediately arose from meditation, and sat upon the lotus lion throne like a vajra mountain king. The new version moves the text about arising from meditation and sitting on the throne to the beginning of the next chapter.

The fourth section "Buddha ascending the flower throne": "Knowing the time" - Master Jizang says this is the time when the Mahāyāna dharma can be expounded. "Obtaining sentient beings' faculties" means knowing that beings' capacities are mature. "Sitting upon the lotus lion throne like a vajra mountain king" - Master Jizang says: The lotus is soft and wishes to manifest wondrous characteristics. Regarding the lion throne, as the Śāstra commentary says: It is not a real lion, nor a wooden or stone lion. Because the Tathāgata is a lion among humans, wherever he sits, whether seat or bed, all are called "lion." "Like a vajra mountain king" - just as Mount Sumeru is established in the great ocean and not moved by the four winds, this represents how the Tathāgata's wisdom is established in the dharma-nature void-space and not moved by the four kinds of heterodox teachers. Master Dōeki says: Lotus is the characteristic of the seat; lion is the place of fearlessness.

Sūtra: The great assembly rejoiced, each manifested immeasurable spiritual powers, and the great assembly dwelt on earth and in space.

The fifth section "great assembly's joy": Regarding "earth and space," Master Jizang says: Those with spiritual powers stay in space; those without spiritual powers are on earth. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: Other realms depend on space, this realm depends on earth. Or perhaps real assemblies depend on earth, transformation assemblies depend on space. Or saints depend on space, ordinary assemblies depend on earth. Or perhaps through other-power, embracing the ordinary, they are also in space. Following pleasure and following powers, they are divided between two places.

Renwang Huguo Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, Chapter Two: Contemplating Emptiness

This chapter and the following six chapters constitute the main body [of the sūtra]. According to various masters' opinions, it is broadly divided into four parts. The first three chapters clarify the protecting prajñā, also called inner protection. The next chapter "Protecting the State" clarifies the protected state territory, also called outer protection. Some say it clarifies the methods of protecting the state. The next chapter "Scattering Flowers" demonstrates ritual offerings, causing people to make offerings. Some call it offering for testimony and faith. Some say scattering flowers as offering represents joy from hearing the dharma. Some call it grateful offering. The next chapter "Upholding" clarifies the virtuous conduct of those who propagate the sūtra. Some call it creating teachings for observance. Regarding the first three chapters, they are divided into three: The "Contemplating Emptiness" chapter clarifies protecting the Buddha fruit. The "Teaching and Transformation" chapter clarifies protecting the causes of the ten grounds. Protecting the fruit is not without causes to achieve the fruit. Protecting causes is not without fruit to clarify causes. The "Two Truths" chapter distinguishes the non-duality of the two truths. Some say: The first two chapters clarify the essence of prajñā - namely the two wisdoms. The last chapter clarifies the truths that are the objects of wisdom. Some say: The two truths clarify what the two protections depend upon. Regarding the first two chapters: The emptiness chapter is real wisdom; teaching and transformation is expedient wisdom. Master Liangben says: States have pure and defiled aspects, divided into two protections. The previous three chapters clarify inner protection, protecting the bodhisattvas' pure lands.

Sūtra: Chapter on Contemplating Emptiness. The new version calls it "Chapter on Contemplating the Tathāgata."

Master Jizang says: Contemplating emptiness means all buddhas and bodhisattvas use signless wisdom to illuminate the signless wondrous realm. Inner and outer are both mysterious, conditions and contemplation are both quiescent. Hence it is called "contemplating emptiness." Also: Contemplation is non-grasping right contemplation. Emptiness is an alternative name for the true characteristics of all dharmas, dharma-nature, and original limit. It is not the emptiness seen by the two vehicles. According to Master Wŏnch'ŭk's understanding: If following Sanskrit pronunciation, emptiness has two meanings. First is śūnya, translated as "empty." This manifests 

[Page 15, Lower]
the meaning of non-existence. As the Yogācāra teaches: conditioned and unconditioned are called "existence"; the absence of self and what belongs to self is called "non-existence." Second is śūnyatā, here meaning "emptiness-nature" - namely the true-thusness revealed by the two emptinesses. Now in this text, where śūnyatā appears, the sound śūnya is explained. In my view: According to Tiantai's understanding, this sūtra should have the emptiness teachings of the Shared, Distinct, and Perfect teachings. As the commentary on the Emptiness chapter of the Suvarṇaprabhāsa says: Emptiness should have four types: extinguishing form to enter emptiness, form itself being emptiness; extinguishing extremes to enter emptiness, extremes themselves being emptiness. Also: Emptiness empties existence and empties non-existence. Emptying existence means emptying the substantial existence of the twenty-five [categories]. Emptying non-existence means emptying the nihilistic non-existence of the two vehicles. Both extremes being pure is called emptiness. In those four emptinesses in that commentary, now the first one should be excluded. Also, the sixty fascicles extensively explain the emptiness teachings of the three teachings. Students should preserve this themselves - I cannot elaborate extensively.

Sūtra: At that time the Buddha addressed the great assembly... to the end of the chapter.

Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: Within inner protection, it is again divided into two parts: first, briefly opening the two protections; later, from "At that time, great king..." onward, extensive explanation through questions and answers. Master Dōeki says: The inner protection text has three parts: first, the Tathāgata's promise to speak; second, Moonlight's request and questions; third, the Tathāgata's correct answer. Master Jizang says: This chapter is divided into three sections: first, addressing the great assembly; second, from "At that time, great king..." onward, questions and answers; third, the assembly's benefits from the gathering. In my view: In dividing the text here, Masters Wŏnch'ŭk and Dōeki encompass three chapters, and Master Jizang also divides the first chapter. Each has their reasoning and they do not contradict each other. Readers should consider this.

Sūtra: At that time the Buddha addressed the great assembly, knowing that the sixteen great kings intended to ask about the causes and conditions for protecting the state territory, I...

Think well on this. The Kaikōkaishi (Wisdom-Light Bodhisattva) is called Zenchikebosatsu (Good Wisdom Bodhisattva) in the new version. Regarding "Gōsha Butsuzō" (Buddha-treasures numerous as the sands of the Ganges), Master Soku says: "In this stage, one attains the four eloquences, therefore one can comprehend in a single thought the sacred teachings of the Buddha's Tripiṭaka numerous as the sands of the Ganges." The Kanjō Bosatsu (Consecration Bodhisattva) is called Hōun Bosatsu (Dharma Cloud Bodhisattva) in the new version. Master Soku says: "The Huayan states: 'Just as when a crown prince of a wheel-turning king achieves royal characteristics and water from the four great seas is taken to pour upon the crown of the prince's head, he is immediately called the Consecrated Great King. The bodhisattva is likewise - at the time of receiving office, the buddhas pour wisdom-water upon this bodhisattva's crown and name him Consecrated Dharma King. This is called the bodhisattva entering the Great Wisdom Office Stage.'" Regarding "Beginning to Enter the Diamond, etc.," Master Zō says: "This clarifies the diamond mind initially reaching firmness, therefore it says 'Beginning to Enter the Diamond, Understanding All.'" The twenty-nine lifetimes refers to leaving one lifetime out of thirty lifetimes, with the Buddha stage completing them all. Master Soku's explanation of the twenty-nine lifetimes is the same as Master Zō's. "Understanding all" means having completed the elimination of obstructions, or having completed the illumination of objects. Master Hin says: "Mental obstructions are permanently absent, illuminating understanding is perfectly complete - this is called 'Understanding All.'" Regarding "Equal Wisdom Consecration" (the new version says "Immovable Good Wisdom Dharma Cloud Stage"), removing the previous remaining habits of ignorance-conditioning and ignorance-habit characteristics causing afflictions (the new version says "removing previous existing ignorance habits, ignorance-habit characteristics, consciousness all transforming"), Master Eki says: "The previous remaining habits of form and mind. Ignorance-conditioning afflictions refer to ignorance as the fundamental root, the support of other delusions, therefore called 'conditioning cause.'" Master Zō says: "Ignorance consists of old afflictions; the four abodes consist of guest afflictions." Regarding "the principle of the two truths being exhausted, etc.," the new version says "the principle of the two truths is perfect with nothing unexhausted." Master Zō says: "Subject and object both merge into obscurity,境 and wisdom are both tranquil, therefore it says 'principle exhausted, all complete.'" Master Eki says: "The principle of the two truths being exhausted means all afflictions are extinguished."

Sūtra: "Perfect Wisdom... to... Subtle Wisdom Remains"

Perfect wisdom without characteristics, king of the three realms - the new version says "Perfect Enlightenment without characteristics, king of the three realms." Master Eki says: "Perfect wisdom is the reward

body; without characteristics is the dharma body; king of the three realms is the response body." Regarding "thirty lifetimes completed, equal great enlightenment" (the new version says "thirty lifetimes completed, wisdom perfected"), Master Soku says: "Enlightening equally regarding all realms is called 'equal great enlightenment.'" Regarding "great tranquility, non-action, diamond treasury" (the new version says "tranquil illumination, non-action, true liberation"), regarding "all rewards exhausted, limitless compassion" (the new version says "great compassion manifesting responses, none can equal"), Master Zō says: "All rewards exhausted means both conditioned existence and inconceivable transformation are both exhausted. Limitless compassion refers to objectless great compassion." Master Eki says: "All rewards being exhausted means there are no more tasks to be done; only through objectless great compassion does one skillfully transform beings as Buddha-work. The previous bodhisattvas made eliminating delusions their work; this one makes compassionate transformation their work." Master Soku takes the first two lines as wisdom-virtue, the next line as elimination-virtue, and the final line as compassion-virtue. Regarding "the ultimate truth is constantly secure" (the new version says "pellucidly immovable, constantly secure"), regarding "exhausting the source, completing nature, subtle wisdom remains" (the new version says "light pervading illumination with nothing illuminated"), Master Soku says: "Exhausting the mundane source of birth and death, completing the true nature of nirvana achieves subtle enlightened wisdom, therefore it says 'subtle wisdom remains.'" Master Eki says: "Exhausting the true, completing the mundane, subtle wisdom remains (I say: exhausting the source of transmigration, completing the nature of birth and death - does the characteristicless subtle wisdom alone remain?)."

Sūtra: "Three Worthies... to... Dwelling in Pure Land"

I say: "Does this generally conclude the five stages?" Masters Zō and Hin seem similar. Regarding "dwelling in karmic reward, etc.," Master Zō says: "Dwelling in karmic reward means dwelling in the lands of conditioned segments and inconceivable transformation (the commentary has the character 'reward'). Also, the three worthies dwell in the reward land of conditioned segments together. The ten sages dwell in the true reward unobstructed (the commentary has the character 'reward') land. Buddha alone dwells in the constantly tranquil light land." Regarding "all sentient beings temporarily dwelling in reward, etc." (the new version says "all sentient beings all temporarily dwell, ascending the diamond plain, constantly immovable"), Master Zō says: "The previous two are all impermanent birth and death." Master Soku says: "All sentient beings, though having no beginning, yet have a time of ending, called 'temporarily dwelling in reward.' Only Buddha alone has a beginning but no end, called 'dwelling in pure land.'"

Sūtra: "Tathāgata's Three Actions... to... Concluding Verse"

Master Eki says: "This is the third general concluding praise. Six lines of text in four parts: first establishing reverence, next two lines praising the three actions, next two lines praising benefiting beings, final line concluding. Also saying 'the Dharma King's compassionate covering' is body-secret; 'the mouth speaking the dharma' is speech-secret; 'mind-wisdom tranquil illumination' is mind-secret." Regarding "covering and protecting the great assembly with limitless light" (I say: Buddha is like a tree among humans, having compassionate light that covers and protects the great assembly?), "constantly speaking dharma with the mouth" - the new version says "the mouth constantly speaks dharma."

Sūtra: "At that time the great assembly... to... limitless karmic rewards"

The new version says: "At that time the great assembly of a hundred million koṭi Ganges sands, hearing Buddha the World-Honored One and King Prasenajit explain the fourteen tolerances and limitless merit, gained great virtue and benefit. Hearing the virtue-dharma and awakening to understanding virtue, they entered the no-birth tolerance and entered the correct position." I say: "Observing the text generally, it seems like three categories of benefit: first, the three destinies of gods, Brahmā, and spirits attain no-birth tolerance; second, the eight divisions and asuras undergo bodily transformation and receive the Way; third, those in three, four, five lifetimes, etc., attain entry into the correct position. What is called 'certifying the nature of sages, etc.' refers to the merit obtained by those entering the correct position. However, Master Zō says there are three sections of attaining benefit: first clarifying gods and humans attaining benefit; down to the second, the three destinies gaining benefit; from 'three lifetimes' down, the third, attaining the Way with varying speed, gaining benefits sooner or later (I say: the text of the three destinies of gods, Brahmā, and spirits is already made into one category - what deep meaning is there in making them separate categories?)." Master Eki makes four benefits: first, hearing-wisdom benefit (from 'at that time the assembly' to 'dharma benefit'); second, attaining certification-Way benefit (from 'immediately thereupon' to 'no-birth tolerance'); third, transformation-reward benefit (from 'eight divisions' to 'receiving the Way'); fourth, proceeding-to-Way benefit (from 'three lifetimes' to 'karmic rewards' - I say the initial hearing-wisdom benefit does not accord with the sūtra text's meaning; first it generally raises all those attaining benefits). Master Soku, following the original record, makes seven benefits: first, hearing-wisdom benefit (from 'at that time the assembly' to 'merit treasury'); second, thinking-wisdom benefit ('attaining great dharma benefit'); third, cultivation-wisdom benefit (from 'immediately thereupon' to 'no-birth tolerance'); fourth, present peaceful (the commentary says 'joyful') dwelling (from 'eight divisions' to 'receiving the Way'); fifth, correct position (from 'three lifetimes' to 'correct position');

【Page 49 Lower】
sixth, pure eye position (the four characters 'certifying sage-nature' are what the two vehicles attain); seventh, future joyful dwelling (attaining all limitless rewards, gaining birth-rewards, subsequent-rewards, and limitless fruits - I say this is also still undecidable). Regarding god-kings and Brahmā-kings, Master Eki says: "Gods refer to the six desire-realm gods; Brahmā refers to the eighteen Brahmā heavens." Regarding the three destinies attaining no-birth tolerance, Master Zō says: "The three destinies of humans, gods, and spirits - not the three evil paths, as the three evil paths are not capable of receiving the Way." Master Eki says: "Spirits and gods, these three destinies, etc., attain no-birth dharma tolerance. Based on this, saying 'eight difficulties' refers to speaking about the majority - it doesn't necessarily completely obstruct the Way." Master Soku's meaning says: "This is not the no-birth tolerance of the ground levels; this attains cultivation-wisdom. The Sarvāstivāda school does not permit evil destinies to attain cultivation-wisdom; now the Mahāyāna school also attains cultivation-wisdom (I say: the text says 'three destinies' without saying 'good and evil' - what fault is there in accepting different meanings? However, the Tiantai school does not obstruct evil destinies from attaining the Way)." Regarding the eight divisions and asura kings, all masters agree: "Below where the four heavenly kings dwell (Master Eki says: in Mount Gandhamādana) there are four: first Rāhu; second Vimalacitra; third Pāli; fourth Virūḍhaka. Below Mount Sumeru there are four: first Dānava (the commentary says 'perhaps'); second Puloman; third Pārāvata; fourth Thaumallū." Regarding correct dwelling, Master Zō says: "The correct position of person-emptiness is from the ten understandings upward; the correct position of dharma-emptiness is from the first ground upward." Master Eki says: "Awakening to the principle of no-birth is called the correct position."

Sūtra: "Buddha told those who had attained the Way... to... practicing prajñāpāramitā" (From here the sūtra text is extremely difficult to understand, therefore carefully citing the sūtra and quoting commentary)

Master Eki says: "Great section three: the Tathāgata's述讃 text has three parts: first describing and praising; second from 'Good sons, these ten...' down, exhortation to practice; third from 'At that time the assembly...' down, celebrating compliance (I say: the division of text and interpretation of meaning here, Masters Eki and Soku are largely the same, with minor differences not having leisure to elaborate extensively; showing the essentials as appropriate)."

Sūtra: "Buddha told those who had attained... to... the merit of divisions and meanings"

Master Eki says: "The initial text has two parts: first praising the people, second describing the teaching." Regarding "those who attained the Way, the fruition-reality, heavenly assembly," Master Soku says: "Those listening

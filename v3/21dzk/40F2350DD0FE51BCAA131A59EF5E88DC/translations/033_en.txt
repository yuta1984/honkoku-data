In order to transform sentient beings, although illuminating the two truths, one sees that Buddhas and sentient beings are one without two. Those who are deluded doubt, saying: "Sentient beings and Buddhas are vastly separated. Why do you say they are one without two?" Therefore, it next explains: "Through sentient beings' emptiness, one places bodhi emptiness." Those who are deluded, attached to bodhi's true emptiness, doubt saying: "Sentient beings' emptiness is the meaning of false dharmas being like illusion. Bodhi emptiness is the meaning of true dharmas transcending falsity. How can one obtain and place bodhi emptiness through sentient beings' emptiness?" Therefore, it next explains: "Through all dharmas' emptiness, therefore emptiness is empty." How could there be distinctions between bodhi emptiness and sentient beings' emptiness? Why? Because prajñā is characteristicless, both truths are empty and quiescent. In prajñā emptiness, ignorance (conventional) and sarvajñā (ultimate) have no self-other characteristics—there is only one suchness. Taking delusion as other and enlightenment as self, therefore one obtains the five eyes, illuminates ultimate meaning, sees with nothing seen, and the two truths have no duality. Therefore, when bodhisattvas cultivate various practices, they practice with nothing practiced, without any attachment to anything. Those who are deluded also say: "If Buddhas and sentient beings are the same one suchness, why transform sentient beings to make them become Buddhas?" Therefore the Buddha explains: "Although one suchness is the same, delusion and enlightenment are still different. One suchness is completely the same. Therefore, although the two truths are one, they are two; although two, they are one," up to "all Buddhas, all dharmas are suchness." Master Zang says: "The wisdom eye sees with nothing seen. Speaking of 'five eyes' refers to them comprehensively." Master Ce says: "Generally mentioning the five eyes, the intention takes the latter three."

Scripture: "Addressed the Buddha saying 'how'..." up to "pāramitā"

I privately say: This clarifies textual prajñā. Master Ce says: "The second question-answer. First question, then answer." Master Ye says: "First question, then answer. Third, 'Great King, suchness suchness' below encourages cultivation."

Scripture: "Addressed the Buddha saying 'how do the Tathāgatas of the ten directions and all bodhisattvas, without departing from letters, practice various"

dharma-characteristics" (The new version says: "King Prasenajit addressed the Buddha saying: How do the Buddhas of the ten directions and all bodhisattvas, without departing from letters, practice true characteristics?")

Master Ce says: "The meaning of this question is: If in the suchness of all dharmas there are no letters, how do the Buddhas depend on letters to cultivate various dharma-characteristics?" Master Ye says: "Śāriputra of the Lesser Vehicle says: 'I have heard that liberation has nothing to be spoken. Therefore I don't know what to say.' The goddess of the Greater Vehicle says: 'Verbal expressions and letters are all liberation characteristics. The nature of letters is separate, having no letters—this is liberation.' 'Without departing from letters, practicing various dharma-characteristics' means various dharma-characteristics are precisely true characteristics. True characteristics are without characteristics. How could one practice without depending on letters?" Master Zang says: "Above it explained that bodhisattvas are in ultimate meaning. What do they transform while constantly speaking the twelve divisions to transform sentient beings?" (I privately say: According to this, one should say that above it also explained textual prajñā emptiness, therefore making this question)

Scripture: "Great King, the dharma wheel..." up to "pāramitā"

Master Ce says: "Second, the Tathāgata's correct answer. Also separately there are two parts. First clarifying teaching emptiness, later clarifying cultivation emptiness."

Scripture: "Great King, the dharma wheel..." up to "not practicing emptiness"

The new version says: "The Buddha said: Great King, letters means: sūtras, verses, prophecies, chanted verses, self-spoken teachings, conditional originations, parables, past events, birth stories, extensive teachings, unprecedented events, and discussions—all the proclaimed sounds, speech, language, letters, and phrases are all suchness. There is nothing that is not true characteristics. If one grasps letter-characteristics, then it is not true characteristics."

Master Ce says: "There are three parts. First, separately clarifying the emptiness of the twelve divisions. Next, 'these names and flavors' below generally distinguishes teaching emptiness. Later, 'if one grasps' reveals non-emptiness. Speaking of 'dharma wheel' has two aspects: first teaching, second practice. Here teaching is spoken of as the dharma wheel." Master Ye says: "The Tathāgata's verbal expressions can destroy afflictions—all are called dharma wheel. Sūtra

is called 'dharma foundation.' Geya is called 'repeated recitation.' Vyākaraṇa is called 'prophecy.' Gāthā is called 'chanted verses'—because long prose is not recited, it's called 'non-recited verses.' Udāna is called 'unsolicited teaching.' Nidāna refers to 'conditional origination'—establishing precepts due to circumstances is also called 'precept scriptures.' Avadāna is called 'parables.' Jātaka is called 'birth stories'—the past birth events of all Buddhas. Therefore 'dharma realm' means lineage—for explaining one's own past lineages. Itivṛttaka (the new version says 'Itivṛttaka'; various masters say 'Itivṛttaka'; however the sounds are interchangeable and should be examined) is called 'past events'—explaining disciples' past life events. Vaipulya is called 'extensive'—correct principle is called 'square,' complete inclusion is called 'extensive.' Adbhutadharma is called 'unprecedented.' Upadeśa is called 'discussion.' (Taking the essential points in brief excerpt)

Master Zang says: "Dharma realm suchness—in the Western country it's called Itivṛttaka. Here it should be called 'past events.' The Buddha explains the boundaries of dharma realms. Also because it explains the events of the past eighteen elements. Past events suchness—in foreign countries it's called Jātaka, here it's called 'birth story scriptures.' Because it explains one's own birth story events. The previous past events scripture explains the eighteen elements of self and others." The rest is the same as Master Ye.

Master Ce says: "Itivṛttaka is called 'dharma realm' and also named 'birth stories.' Realm means birth. Jātaka is called 'past events.'" The rest also agrees with Master Ye. Tiantai's explanation is like the Lotus Profound Meaning.

Regarding "sound fruits": Master Ce says: "Names etc. are provisional; sound substance is real. Because names etc. are provisionally established depending on real sounds above, they are called 'sound fruits.' Such letters and recorded phrases are all suchness." Master Ye says: "Accumulating sounds forms names, accumulating names forms phrases, accumulating phrases express meaning, up to gathering letters to form recorded phrases."

Scripture: "Great King, suchness suchness letters..." up to "pāramitā"

【Page 65 Lower】
The new version says: "Great King, those who cultivate true characteristics cultivate like letters. True characteristics are precisely the wisdom mother of all Buddhas, the fundamental wisdom mother of all sentient beings. This is called the essence of all wisdom. For Buddhas not yet accomplished and future Buddhas, it serves as wisdom mother. For Buddhas already accomplished, it becomes all wisdom. What is not yet attained serves as nature; what is already attained serves as wisdom. The prajñā of the three vehicles is unborn, unceasing, with self-nature constantly abiding. For all sentient beings, this serves as enlightened nature. If bodhisattvas are not attached to letters, do not depart from letters, have no letter-characteristics yet are not without letters, and can cultivate thus without seeing cultivation characteristics, this is called cultivating letters and being able to attain prajñā's true nature. This is prajñāpāramitā."

Master Ye says: "Encouraging cultivation. One fascicle is the same." Master Ce says: "Cultivation emptiness." Master Zang says: "Regarding 'suchness suchness letters, etc.'—previously hearing that the twelve division scriptures are suchness, therefore knowing that letters are precisely suchness. Suchness is precisely prajñā. Prajñā is Buddha's mother, therefore called 'wisdom mother.'" Master Ce says: "Or possibly, 'suchness' is an indication, also revealing the twelve. Because letters are not one, it repeatedly says 'suchness suchness.'"

I privately say: Regarding this passage, various masters' explanations are not clear. Humbly examining, according to the new and old scriptures' meaning: This text has three parts. First, briefly encouraging cultivation of the wisdom mother. Second, "all sentient beings" below distinguishes the wisdom mother's cause and effect. Third, "if bodhisattvas" below properly clarifies the method of cultivating the wisdom mother. (The method follows Master Zang's commentary meaning) From "all sentient beings" to "sarvajñā essence" properly distinguishes cause and effect. True characteristics as one dharma has different names in cause and effect. The cause is called "wisdom mother" because it should give birth to wisdom children. Because the essence is not yet manifest, one seeks function to establish the name when wisdom essence appears before one. Scholars should think carefully. From "Buddhas not yet accomplished" to "sarvajñā" repeatedly explains the previous cause and effect. All sentient beings, because they will become Buddhas, have their possessed true characteristics called wisdom mother. This is not "wisdom is mother" but "mother of wisdom." Wisdom mother is also

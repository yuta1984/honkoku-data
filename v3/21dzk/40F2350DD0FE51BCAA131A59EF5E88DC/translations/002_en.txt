King. Regarding "National Protection," the benevolent king is the agent of protection (nō-go) and the nation-land is the object of protection (sho-go). When the benevolent king governs the way according to the dharma, the ten thousand people find comfort and happiness, and the nation-land becomes peaceful. If we view the benevolent king from the perspective of prajñā, then prajñā is the agent of protection. By maintaining prajñā, the benevolent king becomes peaceful. When people take the dharma as their foundation, the benevolent king is the agent of protection and prajñā is the object of protection. Now, both the benevolent king and prajñā are agents of protection, and the nation-land is the object of protection. Prajñā in Chinese pronunciation means wisdom. Pāra is called "the other shore," and mitā is called "arriving." Abandoning characteristics and meeting reality is called "arriving at the other shore." Also, the cause being able to reach the fruit is called "arriving at the other shore." It should be called "arriving at the other shore," but preserving the Sanskrit original, it is called pāramitā. Sūtra is called sūtra, which is translated as "dharma foundation." Teaching serves as the foundation of principle. The originating conditions are called "introduction" (jo). When categories of meaning follow each other, this is called "chapter" (hon). Being first among the eight chapters, it is called "number one." Second is revealing the sūtra's essence: the five patience levels and ten stages serve as the essence. Third is clarifying the sūtra's principle: correct contemplation of no-birth serves as the principle. From ancient times it has been said: "Shake the fur coat and hold the collar, lift the net and raise the main rope." When there is the essence of the coat and net, the fur and mesh naturally extend. The difference between principle and essence has this meaning. Fourth is distinguishing the sūtra's function: internal and external dual protection serves as the function. Internal protection means explaining for the bodhisattvas the conditions for protecting the Buddha-fruit and the conditions for protecting the practices of the ten stages. External protection means explaining the conditions for protecting the nation-land. Making the nation obtain peace, preventing the seven disasters from arising, not generating calamities, and making the ten thousand people peaceful is called external protection. Fifth is clarifying the doctrinal characteristics: Now, following Bodhiruci, we divide the teachings by partial and complete. This present sūtra is Mahāyāna complete teaching. Master Jizang clarified this based on Tiantai. However, in the interpretations there are similarities and differences. Scholars should adopt or discard as appropriate. Among this master's five categories, name and function are generally acceptable. Regarding the three of essence, principle, and teaching, I personally follow our own school: true reality serves as the essence. From beginning to end, one sūtra clarifies dharma-nature.

Therefore, cause and effect serve as the principle. The five patience levels taught are the Buddha's cause and effect, so among the four teachings, it clarifies the three teachings of Shared, Distinct, and Perfect. Among the five flavors, this is the fourth, the teaching of refined ghee. Also, the four characters "Introductory Chapter, First" do not correspond to Tiantai's five categories. However, contemporary interpreters of sūtras all place them in the explanation of names. Because of the teaching, now as one dharma, we rely on this to interpret the sūtra. Dōeki says: This sūtra, when its essence is unified, is precisely the true reality of all phenomena. Although myriad beings exist abundantly, there is nothing that is not real when immediate to phenomena. This master also uses the five mysterious principles. Also, regarding explaining names, he says: "Benevolent King Prajñā" etc. are specific names, while "sūtra" is a general name. Prajñā has three aspects: first, true reality; second, contemplative illumination; third, written words. Pāramitā is called "ultimate accomplishment of matters" and also called "arrival at the other shore."

The commentary by monk Liangben of Qinglong Temple, who received dictation for the new translation by Amoghavajra Tripiṭaka, states: In interpreting the sūtra title, the meaning encompasses both general and specific. "Benevolent King National Protection" indicates the purpose of the requesting lord; "Prajñāpāramitā" clarifies the profound mystery of realm and wisdom. "Introductory Chapter, First" is the specific heading of the eight chapters. It also states: Benevolence is the head of the five constants; king unifies and crowns the three powers. Protection means compassionate power saving the times; nation is the dwelling castle. Prajñā is pure wisdom that breaks through the troublesome cage of consciousness waves; pāra is the other shore, which is the dwelling of coolness. Mitā has the meanings of separation and arrival. Sūtra means linking and maintaining; introduction is the originating cause; chapter means categorical gathering; "first" means sequence; "one" is the beginning of numbers. Because person and dharma are both manifest, it is thus stated.

Third is entering textual structural interpretation.

Sūtra: From "Thus have I heard" to the end of the sūtra.
Master Jizang says: The first chapter is the introductory section, the next six chapters are the main doctrine, and the final chapter is circulation. Dōeki agrees. Wŏnch'ŭk's commentary takes the final two chapters as circulation. Liangben's commentary on the Entrustment Chapter states: The ancient worthies—Dharma Master Ch'ŭk of Sŏmyŏng Temple, Dharma Master Hyŏnbŏm, and Dharma Master Hyejŏng of Kiguk Temple—all consider this chapter as the circulation section. Tiantai Zhizhe, Dharma Master Dao'an, and Great Dharma Master Anguo all consider this chapter as the main doctrine section. Although all principles have their foundations, now we follow the meaning of Tiantai and others. Examining the Enzōroku, it states: The four-fascicle Ninnō Sūtra Commentary by Great Master Zhizhe has its name on the stele before his tomb but has not been obtained. We always lament losing this wish-fulfilling jewel. Now, relying on Ben's transmission, we barely know the three sections. However, there exists a one-fascicle commentary in the world, traditionally said to be Tiantai's commentary, but the textual meaning seems inappropriate. Many scholars do not trust it. It combines eight chapters into three sections: the first chapter as introductory explanation, the next five chapters as main explanation, and the final two chapters as circulation. The textual divisions are not uniform—sometimes one chapter for circulation, sometimes two or three chapters, arranged according to individual preference. Now I think that taking two chapters as circulation differs from the Tiantai meaning transmitted by Ben. Taking sometimes one chapter, sometimes two or three for circulation is unclear. Various masters agree that there are two types of introduction: general and specific. From "Thus" to the end of "listing the assembly" is the general introduction. From "At that time, the Ten Epithets and Three Insights" down to the end of the chapter is the specific introduction. Master Jizang says: Now using four pairs to encompass the meaning, nothing is left out. First is the pair of verification-faith and origination; second clarifies the pair of general and specific introduction; third clarifies the pair of Tathāgata introduction and Ānanda introduction; fourth clarifies the pair of pre-sūtra and post-sūtra introduction. Ānanda personally receiving the intention is called verification-faith; because it initiates the main doctrine, it is called origination.

[Page 3, Lower]
What is common to all sūtras is called general introduction; because each origination differs, it is called specific introduction. What the Buddha speaks himself is called Tathāgata introduction; Ānanda's verification-faith is called Ānanda introduction. What the Buddha taught is called pre-sūtra introduction; what Ānanda later compiled and verified is called post-sūtra introduction. Tiantai's Lotus Sūtra Commentary states that the general introduction has five, six, or seven elements. The record states that five, six, or seven elements means: five as in the text; six separates Buddha and place; seven separates "I" and "heard." Master Jizang says: Various masters' explanations are not fixed—sometimes five, sometimes seven. Now following the Vajra Immortal Treatise, we make distinctions with six phrases: First, "thus" expresses the characteristic of faith; second, "I heard" clarifies that Ānanda received the intention and verified it, transmitting without creating; third, "one time" clarifies the time period of hearing the sūtra; fourth, "Buddha" clarifies the transformation lord; fifth, "dwelling place" clarifies that teaching and listening have location; sixth, "fellow listeners" verify that there is no falseness or error. Regarding the fellow listener assembly, various masters agree: first twelve assemblies, then a general conclusion. The twelve assemblies are: 1) śrāvakas, 2) pratyekabuddhas, 3) bodhisattvas, 4) holders of five precepts and worthies, 5) faithful laywoman, 6) seven worthy householders, 7) various brahmās of the form realm, 8) six heavens of the desire realm, 9) sixteen great kings, 10) five destinies, 11) other regions, 12) transformations. Also, the twelve are divided into three: the first ten are of this land, the next one is of other regions, the last one is transformations.

Sūtra: Together with the great bhikṣu assembly of eight hundred million, up to "all accomplished"
The new version states: Together with the great bhikṣu assembly of 1,800 people, all arhats. It only praises the virtues of arhats. Regarding the first śrāvakas, both learners and no-more-learners all being arhats, Master Ch'ŭk says: There are two types of arhats: first, practicing arhats who are learners; second, dwelling arhats of the fourth fruit. Therefore, the Satyasiddhi Treatise states: There are two types of arhats, called dwelling and practicing. Or they may partially possess the meaning of "worthy of offerings" and so forth. Most masters...

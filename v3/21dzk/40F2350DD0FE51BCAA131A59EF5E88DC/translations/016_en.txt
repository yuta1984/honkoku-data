patience acquired immeasurable merits and great dharma benefits). Fourth is the Tathāgata's approval. Fifth, from "Good son, these fourteen" onward praises the function and encourages cultivation (from here below does not necessarily belong to the approval; Master Liangbian's intention is similar). Sixth, from "At that time among the various assemblies" onward is the assembly's respectful practice.

Sūtra: The Buddha said "Great King" up to "the king transforms all sentient beings."

Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: In answering the two questions there are two parts. First correctly answering the previous question while also answering about benefiting others. Later, from "addressing the Buddha saying" onward correctly answers the latter question while also answering about self-benefit. Master Wave says: The initial five patiences answer the first question; the latter ten grounds answer the second question.

Sūtra: The Buddha said "Great King" up to "the fourteen patiences are complete."

Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: In the foregoing, first establishing the doctrine; next from "Good son" onward explaining extensively in sequence; later from "sentient beings' fundamental karma" onward concluding after explaining. Master Dōeki also divides similarly into three parts. However, from "sentient beings' fundamental karma" onward belongs to the extensive explanation text, and from "these Buddhas" onward constitutes the general conclusion. This should be understood below.

Sūtra: The Buddha said "Great King" up to "cultivating prajñāpāramitā."

The first fascicle says: The upper, middle, and lower levels of patience of submission (furen) are: habitual seed-nature as lower, inherent seed-nature as middle, path seed-nature as upper. These three are the thirty minds. The upper, middle, and lower levels of patience of faith (shinren) are: first ground as lower, second ground as middle, third ground as upper. The upper, middle, and lower levels of patience of accordance (junren) are the fourth, fifth, and sixth grounds respectively. The upper, middle, and lower levels of patience of no-arising (mushōren) are the seventh, eighth, and ninth grounds respectively. The upper and lower levels of patience of cessation (jakumetsu) are: lower is the tenth ground, upper is Buddha-fruit. Master Dōeki says: Being able to subdue afflictions is called patience of submission; being able to purify the four faiths is called patience of faith; afflictions becoming harmonized is called patience of accordance; realizing the non-arising of dharmas is called patience of no-arising; awakening to the non-extinction of dharmas is called

[Page 30, Lower]
patience of cessation. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: Not yet having attained the uncontaminated and being unable to realize internally, only being able to subdue and remove but not permanently cut off is called patience of submission. Because of attaining uncontaminated faith it is called patience of faith. Proceeding toward patience of no-arising is called accordance. Peacefully dwelling in the principle of no-arising is called patience of no-arising. Contemplating first-meaning cessation, true suchness is called patience of cessation. Master Jizang says: Patience of accordance is the proximate condition for no-arising. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: However, these five patiences differ among various sūtras. If we follow the Fundamental Karma Necklace Sūtra, it opens into six natures: first is habitual seed-nature, second is inherent seed-nature, third is path seed-nature, fourth is sage seed-nature, fifth is equal awakening nature, sixth is wondrous awakening nature. In sequence: ten dwellings, ten practices, ten dedications, ten grounds, diamond mind, and Tathāgata ground. Extensively opened there are forty-two worthies and sages - namely ten dwellings, ten practices, ten dedications, ten grounds, equal awakening, wondrous awakening. According to the Good Precepts Sūtra and Yogācāra fascicle 47, the bodhisattva grounds are opened into thirteen dwellings: first is seed-nature, second is understanding and practice, ten grounds as ten, Buddha ground as one. However, regarding this explanation of the three patience of submission positions, there are briefly three interpretations. One fundamental explanation says: ten faiths as habitual seed-nature, ten understandings as inherent seed-nature, ten practices as path seed-nature, from ten dedications onward belonging to the path of seeing. Because the sūtra explains faith etc. as their nature, and also below says "ten faiths, ten cessations, ten firm minds," we know ten faiths as habitual seed-nature. One says: In this sūtra ten faiths are habitual, ten understandings and ten practices are inherent, ten dedications are path seed-nature. One says: These three grades of patience of submission are like the Necklace Sūtra's three kinds of patience of submission. Though there are three explanations, the latter explanation is good. The various sacred teachings do not contradict reason. Master Jizang in explaining inherent seed-nature says: This sūtra's inherent seed-nature is in ten understandings and ten practices. The Flower Garland takes ten faiths as habitual seed and ten practices as inherent seed. According to the Flower Garland,

[Page 31, Upper]
ten understandings are ten dwellings - first called arousing mind dwelling up to consecration dwelling; ten practices are joyful practice up to true practice (I say: This master takes ten faiths as habitual seed-nature). Also in explaining the later Upholding chapter, he takes ten dwellings as habitual seed-nature and ten practices as inherent seed-nature (I say: One master's explanations contradict each other). Master Dōeki says: Various sūtras explain ten faiths and ten dwellings separately; this sūtra discusses them together. The final mind of ten faiths is the initial mind of first dwelling. Receiving the name from the beginning, therefore it only speaks of faith. The first fascicle's meaning says: Because faith-roots are not yet established, it speaks of "phase-faith"; because faith-roots are already established, it is called faith. I say: Because the sūtra text is unclear, there are many different interpretations. Examining new and old sūtras, the names faith and dwelling seem interchangeable. Taking dwelling as habitual - this meaning is good. Tiantai's Lotus Profound Meaning fascicle 4 says: "Question: From the seventh and eighth grounds contemplating permanent dwelling and breaking ignorance - what ground-position is this? Answer: This is neither Shared nor Distinct teaching. Why? The Shared teaching from beginning to end does not clarify contemplating the permanent - how could it break ignorance in the middle? The Distinct teaching knows permanent dwelling from the initial mind and can already break it at the first ground. How can it be said that ignorance is first broken at the eighth ground? This is the meaning of Distinct embracing Shared." Also in clarifying Distinct teaching positions it says: "The Flower Garland clarifies forty-one grounds - meaning thirty minds, ten grounds, Buddha ground. The Necklace clarifies fifty-two positions. The Benevolent King clarifies fifty-one positions. The new Golden Light Sūtra presents ten grounds and Buddha-fruit. The Victorious Heavenly King Prajñā clarifies fourteen patiences. The Great Treatise only clarifies ten grounds. The Nirvāṇa clarifies five practices and ten merits." Also in the fifth clarifying Perfect positions it says: "Question: How do we know the moon metaphor analogizes positions? Answer: The Benevolent King clarifies fourteen patiences - thirty minds as three prajñās, ten grounds as ten prajñās, equal awakening as one prajñā. The fourteen prajñās are in bodhisattva minds, all called patience. Turning to Buddha mind they are called wisdom. This is the same as the fifteenth day clarifying

[Page 31, Lower]
wisdom positions." Profound Meaning fascicle 5 says: "The Great Nirvāṇa says: Moon-Love samādhi from the first day to the fifteenth day." Also in clarifying Perfect ten faiths it says: "The Benevolent King Prajñā says: Ten-good bodhisattvas arouse great mind, permanently separating from the three realms' suffering wheel ocean. This is also this position." The ground-positions explained in the present sūtra should be considered by matching and explaining the three teachings.

Sūtra: Good son, sentient beings numerous as Ganges sands with initial arousal phase-faith cultivate patience of submission, giving rise to habitual seed-nature in the Three Jewels. The ten minds are: faith mind, vigorous effort mind, mindfulness mind, wisdom mind, concentration mind, giving mind, precept mind, protection mind, vow mind, dedication mind. This is called bodhisattvas with no partial transformation - sentient beings have already transcended all good grounds of the two vehicles. All Buddhas and bodhisattvas nourish the ten minds as the sacred embryo.

The new translation says: "At the initial patience of submission position, arousing habitual seed-nature, cultivating ten dwelling practices with initial arousal mind characteristics." The first fascicle says: The first clarifies the lower grade of patience of submission. Namely, the initial ten minds first become empty understanding, attaining without retreating from true understanding seeds. Therefore called seed; because good does not retreat and disappear, called nature. Speaking of "initial arousal phase" - those outer ordinary beings cut off corrupt minds and cultivate great practices, yet still have retreat and loss, not yet being able to say this is the path to reach this ground. Because mind is accomplished it is called initial arousal; not yet being truly established, therefore given the name "phase." Because faith-roots are already established it is called faith. Up to cultivating these ten minds, one is able to realize the first ground, being born in Buddha's family therefore called sacred embryo. Master Dōeki says: ... and precepts are called faith; exclusively vigorous therefore called advancement; constantly right mindfulness therefore called mindfulness; clearly seeing dharma-principle called wisdom; not being scattered therefore called concentration; material and dharma giving called giving; maintaining the three collections purely called precepts. Protection mind - other sūtras call it dharma-protection mind. Vows are the four universal vows.

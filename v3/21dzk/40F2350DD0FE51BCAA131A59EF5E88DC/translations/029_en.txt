Master Kō cites important passages. The lower fascicle of the Fundamental Activities Necklace Sūtra says: "All sentient beings' consciousness initially arises one thought and abides in conditions. Following the ultimate truth-principle, what arises is called good; opposing the ultimate truth-principle, what arises is called delusion. Using these two as dwelling-grounds, they are therefore called 'inborn good and inborn delusion.' Taking these two good-delusions as root, all subsequent good-delusions arise. All subsequent dharmas that conditionally produce good-delusion are called 'cultivated good-delusion.' From the names of the two attainments, therefore good-delusion and the two minds arise desire-realm delusions called 'desire-realm dwelling-ground.' Arising form-realm delusions is called 'form-realm dwelling-ground.' Because mental delusions arise, it's called 'formless-realm dwelling-ground.' Using the four dwelling-grounds to arise all afflictions, they become the 'initially arising four dwelling-grounds.' Before these four dwelling-grounds, no dharmas arise further. Therefore it's called 'beginningless ignorance dwelling-ground.' Diamond wisdom knows this initially arising single characteristic has an end, but doesn't know whether there are dharmas or no dharmas before its beginning. How can one come to know the inborn single dwelling-ground and cultivated three dwelling-grounds? Only Buddha knows the beginning and knows the end." The Awakening of Faith says: "Mind's birth-and-death depends on tathāgatagarbha, therefore there is birth-and-death mind. What is called 'neither-arising-nor-ceasing' harmonizes with 'birth-and-death,' being neither one nor different. This is called ālaya consciousness. This consciousness has two kinds of meaning, able to embrace all dharmas and generate all dharmas. What are the two? First, enlightenment meaning; second, non-enlightenment meaning." It also says: "What is called non-enlightenment meaning refers to not knowing true-suchness dharma-oneness as it really is. Therefore non-enlightened mind arises and has thoughts. Thoughts have no self-nature and don't separate from original enlightenment. Like a confused person who becomes lost depending on directions—if separated from directions, there would be no confusion." Examining the commentary's meaning: "Non-enlightenment has two kinds: first, fundamental non-enlightenment, namely ignorance; second, branch non-enlightenment, namely ignorance karma-characteristics, etc. Initially saying 'because of not knowing true-suchness dharma-oneness as it really is'—

【Page 56 Lower】
fundamental ignorance is like being confused about directions. 'Non-enlightened mind arises and has thoughts' means karma-characteristic's moving thoughts are deviant. Like there being no separate deviant west apart from leaving true east. Therefore it says 'thoughts have no self-characteristics and don't separate from original enlightenment.'" The treatise also says: "Furthermore, depending on non-enlightenment, three kinds of characteristics arise, corresponding to that non-enlightenment and inseparable from it. What are the three? First, ignorance karma-characteristic: depending on non-enlightenment, mind moves and is called karma. When enlightened, it doesn't move. When moving, there is immediately suffering. Effects don't separate from causes. Second, able-to-see characteristic: depending on movement, one is able to see. Without movement there is no seeing. Third, sense-realm characteristic: depending on able-to-see, sense-realms falsely appear. Separated from seeing, there are no sense-realms. Due to having sense-realm conditions, six moving characteristics are again produced." The commentary says: "This reveals beginning-and-end non-enlightenment. Saying 'corresponding to that non-enlightenment and inseparable' means that root and branches interdepend, therefore called 'corresponding'—not like the meaning of king-and-mental-factors correspondence. This is because it's non-corresponding defiled mind. Saying 'ignorance karma-characteristic' means depending on ignorance, movement is called karma-characteristic. Therefore the meaning of arising-movement is the meaning of karma. Therefore it says 'mind's movement is called karma.' 'When enlightened, immediately no movement' means raising the opposite to reveal by contrast. That is, at the time of initial enlightenment there are immediately no moving thoughts. Therefore knowing that present movement is immediately suffering. Karma-characteristic is original suffering; ignorance is original accumulation. Thus cause and effect exist simultaneously. Therefore it says 'effects don't separate from causes.' However, this karma-characteristic, separated from moving thoughts, is extremely subtle. Able and object are not yet differentiated. That fundamental ignorance should also be known as such" (taking the meaning). It also says: "These three are all differentiations possessed by the ālaya consciousness stage." The treatise also says: "What is called mind-nature constantly having no thoughts is therefore called 'unchanging.' Because of not penetrating the one dharma-realm, mind doesn't correspond. Suddenly thoughts arise, called ignorance." (That treatise extensively explains the mind's true-

【Page 57 Upper】
suchness gate and mind's birth-and-death gate; the meaning of that birth-and-death gate is the same as this sūtra's intention. Scholars should investigate further). The commentary says: "This clarifies that this ignorance is most extremely subtle, not yet having the distinctions of able-object king-and-mental-factors. Therefore it says 'mind doesn't correspond.' Only this root has no separate defiled dharmas. What could be more subtle than this and exist before it—because of this meaning, it explains 'suddenly arising.' As the Fundamental Activities Sūtra says: 'Before the four dwelling-grounds, no dharmas arise further. Therefore it's called beginningless ignorance dwelling-ground.' It also says: 'This explains ignorance according to the gate of subtle-coarse interdependence. It also says suddenly arising—not explaining sudden arising according to temporal periods.' It also says: 'Ignorance dwelling-ground has two kinds of meaning. If discussing the cultivated dwelling-ground gate, from the first ground up one can attain gradual elimination. If regarding the inborn dwelling-ground gate, only Buddha's bodhi-wisdom can eliminate it.'" (That commentary clarifies the Mahāyāna's secret four characteristics; those four characteristic-stages are generally combined into one unity. Scholars should investigate). I privately examine the Commentary on the Vimalakīrti's "Observing Sentient Beings" chapter, which says: "Good and non-good take the view-of-single-place dwelling-ground as root. The view-of-single-place dwelling-ground takes desire-love dwelling-ground as root. Desire-love dwelling-ground [text possibly missing] as root. Form-love dwelling-ground takes existence-love dwelling-ground as root. Existence-love dwelling-ground takes ignorance dwelling-ground as root. Ignorance is called 'non-dwelling.' Non-dwelling has no root." There are also extra-realm four dwellings and intra-realm four dwellings. Also explaining the five dwellings, the distinct and perfect teaching meanings differ. That commentary's explanation of the sūtra text "non-dwelling, no root" says: "The Mahāyānasaṃgraha explains: 'Ālaya consciousness is the root of all worldly birth-and-death.' Therefore that treatise says: 'This consciousness from beginningless time is what all depends upon.' This ignorance has no further dependence. Therefore it says 'non-dwelling, no root.' This is precisely beginningless ignorance. Its power is greatest, what Buddha's bodhi-wisdom can eliminate. Down to 'non-dwelling is immediately no root' means correctly speaking that ignorance depends on dharma-nature, dharma-nature is immediately ignorance—not two, not different. How could nature again depend on nature? One should

【Page 57 Lower】
know that ignorance has no root. Therefore the ten dwellings see the end but don't see the beginning. All buddhas and tathāgatas see the end and see the beginning. If observing sentient beings, entering emptiness and reaching the non-dwelling root, this penetrates to the bottom, exhausts the source, and reaches middle-way principle. Since it says 'non-dwelling, no root,' this is immediately sentient beings, empty space, buddha-nature—the three truths above are all empty." It also says: "From the non-dwelling root, all dharmas are established—namely all worldly and transcendental, conditioned and unconditioned dharmas all arise from the non-dwelling root. Why? If one is deluded about non-dwelling, then the three realms and six paths exist in confusion, establishing all worldly dharmas. If one understands non-dwelling, this is immediately beginningless ignorance returning to the root, returning to the source, manifesting truth and becoming sage. Therefore there are four kinds of transcendental sage dharmas. Therefore through non-dwelling, all dharmas are established." It also says: "Question: If ignorance depends on dharma-nature, then dharma-nature becomes the beginning. How can it be called beginningless? Answer: Ignorance depending on dharma-nature is having a beginning. Dharma-nature is not affliction. One cannot point to dharma-nature as the root of afflictions. Therefore it says 'non-dwelling is therefore rootless.' If depending on dharma-nature to establish all dharmas, ignorance doesn't emerge from dharma-nature; dharma-nature immediately becomes the root of ignorance. This takes dharma-nature as root. Now the sūtra investigates and examines the root of afflictions. Dharma-nature is not affliction, therefore it says 'non-dwelling, no root.' Since there is no root, one cannot self-dwell. One dwells depending on others. If explaining self-dwelling, viewing dharma-nature as other, one can also explain this as dwelling depending on others. Explaining self-dwelling is the distinct teaching's meaning; depending-on-others dwelling is the perfect teaching's meaning." It also says: "Question: Do non-dwelling and having-dwelling have opening and closing? Answer: If unified, ignorance is merely dharma-nature; dharma-nature is non-dwelling, ignorance is also non-dwelling. Therefore it says 'non-dwelling.' If opening dharma-nature and producing ignorance, ignorance depends on dharma-nature. One can also say 'having dwelling.' Having dwelling means depending on..."

permanent. The ultimate is empty of inherent nature arising from conditions, therefore it is non-arising. The ten firm minds - Master Dōeki says: Because they cannot be made to retreat or be destroyed, they are called firm.

Sutra: Furthermore, the faith-patience bodhisattvas, namely those practicing in good penetrating illumination, sever the bondage of form-afflictions of the three realms and can transform [beings in] hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of Buddha-lands, manifesting hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of bodies with immeasurable spiritual powers and merits, constantly taking the fifteen minds as primary: the four means of gathering, four immeasurable minds, four great vows, three liberation gates. From the good awakening ground to sarvajña, this bodhisattva takes these fifteen minds as the fundamental seeds of all practices.

Good penetrating illumination (the new translation says: joyful ground, ground free from suffering, light-emitting ground). Severing form-afflictions of the three realms (the new translation says: able to sever the bondage of form-afflictions of the three obstacles). Master Liangbian says the three obstacles are greed, hatred, and delusion, severed in sequence by the three grounds. The first fascicle says: "These three grounds equally observe the faults and suffering of form-bodies in the three realms, severing and eliminating form-delusions. This is discussed from one perspective; the principle is not necessarily so. It is just that form and mind are relatively prominent, and when discussing delusion in relation to this, difficulty and ease arise." Master Dōeki says: "Question: What delusions are called 'form'? Answer: Being deluded by the characteristics of arising-ceasing, existence-nonexistence, defilement-purity etc. of form is called delusion." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Delusions that take form and mind as objects are called form-mind delusions. Or from analogy... form-mind delusions." Master Liangbian says: "Being able to generate form-karma or taking form-objects as conditions is called form-afflictions." Being able to transform hundreds of Buddhas etc. - Master Dōeki says: "First ground: hundred Buddha-lands; second ground: thousand Buddha-lands; third ground: ten thousand Buddha-lands. The correspondence of hundreds, thousands, ten thousands of bodies and dharma-gates can be known." Four means of gathering (as before), four immeasurables (as before), four

great vows - the new translation says: "Possessing the four great vows, severing all entanglements and coverings, constantly transforming sentient beings, cultivating Buddha's knowledge and vision, accomplishing supreme awakening." Various masters say: "Causing those not yet liberated to be liberated, etc." Three liberations (as before). Master Jizang says: "First is conceptual faith - light-hair bodhisattvas; second is long-lasting faith - the three worthies; third is realized faith - first ground and above."

Sutra: Furthermore, the accordance-patience bodhisattvas, namely [those in] superior vision present dharma, able to sever the bondage of mind and other afflictions of the three realms, therefore manifest one body in Buddha-lands of the ten directions, transforming sentient beings with immeasurable, ineffable spiritual powers.

Superior vision present dharma (the new translation says: blazing wisdom ground, hard-to-conquer ground, manifest ground). Severing mind and other afflictions of the three realms (the new translation says: able to sever the bondage of mind-afflictions of the three obstacles). The first fascicle says: "Here observing emptiness, able to sever attachment to mind-delusions... and other mental factors." Manifesting one body etc. - Master Dōeki says: "One body means the dharma-nature body. 'In the ten directions' abbreviates the text. According to the text below: fourth ground - ten billion, fifth ground - hundred billion, sixth ground - trillion." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Question: Why does faith-patience speak of 'hundreds of bodies etc.' while this accordance-patience only speaks of 'one body'? Answer: Faith-patience clarifies transformation bodies; this explains the real body. Question: Can a bodhisattva's body reach the ten directions simultaneously? Answer: One view says it can, because it is inconceivable. Another says it cannot - a real body cannot be in many places. For now we follow the latter explanation."

Sutra: Furthermore, the no-arising patience bodhisattvas, namely [those with] far, immovable, observing wisdom, also sever the habitual afflictions of mind, form, etc. of the three realms, therefore [have] ineffable, ineffable merit and spiritual powers.

Far, immovable, observing wisdom (the new translation says: Furthermore, no-arising patience bodhisattvas: far-reaching ground, immovable ground, universal wisdom ground). Severing habitual afflictions of mind, form, etc. of the three realms (the new translation says: able to sever the habitual energies of form-mind of the three obstacles). The first fascicle says: "Those who explain differ. Some say severing three-

[Page 35, Upper]
realm delusions, all the rest are called accumulations. Also said: The number of categories of accumulations of the three poisons equals beginninglessness, exhausted only at the ten grounds. Also said: In actual discussion of severing accumulations, clear wisdom is at the seventh ground. However, this sutra does not yet clarify the five dwelling-ground delusions, therefore it comprehensively bundles delusions outside the three realms and calls them all habitual energies." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Previously having already severed form-mind afflictions, now severing the subtle ones is called form-mind and other habits." Master Dōeki says: "Primary [afflictions] were severed before; only remaining habits are severed."

Sutra: Furthermore, extinction-patience - Buddha and bodhisattvas equally use this patience to enter diamond samādhi. Practicing in lower patience is called bodhisattva; practicing in upper patience is called sarvajña. Together observing the ultimate truth, severing the mind-habits and ignorance of the three realms to exhaustion, taking the characteristics as diamond exhausted-characteristics and no-characteristics to be sarvajña, transcending conventional truth and ultimate truth, beyond these is the eleventh ground sarvajña-awakening. Neither existent nor non-existent, perfectly clear and pure, permanently dwelling and unchanging, equal to the true limit and dharma-nature, with unconditioned great compassion teaching and transforming all sentient beings, riding the sarvajña vehicle to come and transform the three realms. Good sons, the afflictions of all sentient beings do not transcend the three-realm store, the fruition-retribution twenty-two faculties of all sentient beings do not transcend the three realms, the response-transformation dharma-bodies of all Buddhas also do not transcend the three realms. If there are no sentient beings outside the three realms, what would Buddhas transform? Therefore I say: "Outside the three realms there is separately one sentient being realm-store" - this is explained in the non-Buddhist Great Existence Sutra, not what the seven Buddhas taught. Great King, I constantly teach: those who have severed and exhausted the three-realm afflictions and fruition-retribution of all sentient beings are called Buddha. Self-nature purity is called awakening; sarvajña-nature is the fundamental karma of sentient beings.

Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "The text has four divisions: first, establishing names and assigning positions; second, clarifying the elimination of obstacles; third, distinguishing differences regarding truths; fourth, from 'unconditioned' below, the scope of those to be transformed." Master Dōeki says: "First, jointly explaining two categories; later, from 'transcending' below, separately explaining the Buddha-realm." Buddha and bodhisattvas equally use this patience (the new translation says: extinction-patience means Buddha and bodhisattvas equally depend on this patience). Entering diamond samādhi, practicing in lower patience is called bodhisattva (the new translation says: diamond-like concentration, dwelling in the lower patience position is called bodhisattva). In upper patience

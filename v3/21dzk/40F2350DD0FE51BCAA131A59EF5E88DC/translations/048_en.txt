Scripture: "In the later five turbid ages" up to "at that time the true dharma will not perish for long"
Master Ce says: The seven admonitions are divided into seven parts: First, admonishing the faults of various dharma-destroying acts. Second, admonishing the destruction of the four assemblies' practices. Third, prohibiting and admonishing non-reliance on dharma. Fourth, admonishing self-destruction. Fifth, admonishing exploitation. Sixth, admonishing self-blame. Seventh, admonishing false beliefs. Master Ye's interpretation agrees with this. The first scroll says: The first one is general, the latter six are specific. I say: The seven admonitions are similar and it's difficult to distinguish their differences. Although the various masters present different names, the meanings haven't been distinguished. Now examining the sutra text, the general direction is the same. This also admonishes kings, ministers, and disciples of the four assemblies - all who fail to practice good, practice evil, destroy dharma and destroy countries, causing themselves and others to invite disasters and experience suffering in the present and future. However, extending the admonitions to seven shows earnest repetition. Perhaps there's something represented, namely representing the meaning of eliminating seven difficulties and generating seven blessings, etc. But to distinguish the seven differences in general terms, it's as the first scroll says: the first one is general, the latter six are specific. Although the general applies to all evils, the text briefly raises five categories: First, relying on high nobility to control the four assemblies and not allowing renunciation, spiritual practice, etc. Second, establishing統officials to control the masses, etc. Third, setting up high seats for laypeople on monks' ground. Fourth, making soldiers and slaves into monks. Fifth, receiving separate invitations, etc. Regarding the "separate six": the first one has no separate matter. It also raises the fault of relying on high nobility to control the four assemblies from the general section, using it to admonish about the conditions that harm people and destroy countries. The second admonishes the fault of binding monks, etc. Although the meaning appears within the general section, the words begin here. The third, destroying dharma, etc., also doesn't depart from the general meaning. Here it separately admonishes those who protect and uphold Buddha-dharma and the faults of self-destruction, etc. The fourth, 統officials, etc., is also in the general text. The fifth also admonishes about the blame of self-creating and self-receiving regarding the gravity of previously committed sins. The sixth admonishes the evil teachings of fame-seeking monks and the false beliefs of ignorant kings.

Scripture: "In the later five turbid ages" up to "at that time the true dharma will not perish for long"
Master Ce says: First, admonishing the faults of various dharma-destroying acts. Regarding "turbid," Master Ce says: Turbid means dregs and defilement. Therefore the Abhidharmakośa volume twelve says: "At the end of kalpa destruction, lifespan and so forth become base and lowly like dregs and filth, therefore it's called turbid." Also, the Abhidharmakośa-vyākhyā volume thirty-two says: "What is the meaning of turbid? Because it's extremely base and lowly. Because it should be abandoned. Because it's like dregs and filth." Regarding "clearly creating restrictive laws, etc.," Master Ce says: The text about dharma destruction has two parts. First, restricting the four blessings: first restricting renunciation, second restricting spiritual practice, third restricting image-making, fourth restricting stupa construction. Second, establishing four wrong teachings: first establishing統officials to control the masses, registering and recording monks without following monastic law - this fault; second setting up high seats for laypeople on monks' ground; third making soldiers and slaves into monks, thereby violating the characteristics of the noble field of merit; fourth receiving separate invitations loses the characteristics of the sangha field of merit - this is heterodox dharma. Therefore monks should be supported. The Dharma Practice Sutra says: "If among my disciples there are those who receive separate invitations, such persons will definitely lose the first fruit, second fruit, third fruit, and fourth fruit. They cannot be called monks, cannot walk on the king's land, cannot drink the king's water. Five hundred great demons constantly obstruct their path. Such monks will not see Buddha for seven kalpas." Buddha doesn't extend his hand to them, they don't receive donors' offerings. Five thousand great demons constantly follow behind them, calling them "great thieves in the Buddha-dharma." Monks should not do this. Requesting monks in order is the dharma of the seven Buddhas. In the sequential sangha there are Buddha-transformed monks, four path-fruit monks, bodhisattva monks, seven noble monks, and ordinary monks. Wanting to enable donors from the four directions to encounter such sangha, don't receive separate invitations. Monks who are acquaintances working together with one mind, making vegetarian

gatherings for friendly monks to seek blessings. Readers should think well about this.

Scripture: "Great king, destroying..." up to "inexhaustible through endless kalpas"
The new version says: Great king, the causes and conditions for destroying countries are all your own creation - relying on your威power, controlling the four assemblies and not allowing cultivation of merit. Various evil monks receive separate invitation dharma. Monks who are acquaintances work together with one mind, mutually creating friendly vegetarian gatherings to seek blessings - this is heterodox dharma. Master Ce says: Second, admonishing the destruction of the four assemblies' practices. Master Ye says: Like a dragon dwelling in pond water that never runs dry, when the Three Jewels exist in the world, blessings and benefits are boundless. Therefore destroying the dharma practices of the four assemblies immediately causes suffering for the people. Master Zang says: Controlling the four assembly disciples means creating secular laws beyond the five categories and seven groups, governing monks and others, using the anger of dharma-protecting good spirits to cause illness and destroy the country. Regarding "explaining the five turbidities, etc.," in the new version this comes after the seven admonitions and resembles general text.

Scripture: "Great king, at dharma's end..." up to "dharma extinction will not be long"
Master Ce says: Third, prohibiting and admonishing non-reliance on dharma and vinaya. Master Zang says: "Like prisoner law" means the extreme of vinaya dharma. There's only expelling the renunciant community. Now practicing secular law, dharma extinction will not be long.

Scripture: "Great king, after my parinirvāṇa..." up to "it's also like this"
Master Ce says: Fourth, admonishing self-destruction. Up to as in the Lotus Face Sutra: Buddha told Ānanda: "Like when a lion dies, whether in sky, on earth, in water, or on land, all sentient beings dare not eat that lion's body and flesh. Only the lion's body itself produces various worms that eat the lion's flesh in return. Ānanda, my Buddha-dharma cannot be destroyed by others. It's the various evil monks in my dharma who destroy the Buddha-dharma that I accumulated through three great asaṃkhyeya kalpas of

diligent practice and hardship." Regarding "their lifespan decreases daily reaching thousands and hundreds of years," I say: This passage's meaning is difficult to understand. The new version lacks this passage. The various masters don't explain it. Now following the meaning I say: In the decreasing kalpa, lifespan decreases by one year per hundred years. Now in the final age when dharma perishes, calamities increase and decrease lifespans, daily decreasing to quickly reach one portion of those hundred years. Or it could be said: This passage should belong to the following sentence, meaning after Buddha's parinirvāṇa reaching thousands and hundreds of years, people destroy Buddha's teachings. "Six relatives" - Master Ce says: Parents, brothers, husband and wife. "Disasters and strange occurrences, misfortunes from beginning to end, rampant" - Master Ye says: Disasters, strange occurrences, and calamities gradually increase daily, continuing from beginning to end. Regarding "if born as humans, etc.," Master Ye says: Disparaging true dharma receives inferior rewards. Regarding "like echoes, etc.," Master Ye says: Like shadows and echoes, inescapable. Regarding "like a person writing at night, etc.," Master Ben says: Fire represents karma-creation, characters represent perfuming. Although fire and karma cease, the character-seeds don't perish. Regarding "three realm retribution, etc."

Scripture: "Great king, in the future..." up to "Buddha-dharma will not last long"
The new version says: Great king, in future ages all kings, princes, and ministers wrongfully establish registration records with my disciples, setting up officials as administrators, major and minor sangha supervisors, unreasonably exploiting them. You should know that at such times the Buddha-dharma will not last long. Master Ben says: In Western countries, renunciants don't establish registration records and also have no supervisors. All supervision within the sangha is nonexistent. Master Ce says: Fifth, admonishing exploitation. The text has four parts: first wrongful control, second "if my..." below on exploitation, third "establishing supervision..." below on registration and recording, fourth "at that time..." below showing faults. The registration and recording text has four sections: first official registration,

second administrative registration, third sangha registration, fourth "belonging to prisoner and slave soldier law."

Scripture: "Great king, in the future..." up to "not Buddha, Dharma, Sangha"
Master Ce says: Sixth, admonishing self-blame. Regarding "not Buddha, Dharma, Sangha."

Scripture: "Great king, in the future..." up to "will not perish for long"
The new version says: Great king, in future ages all kings and disciples of the four assemblies should rely on the path constantly practiced by all Buddhas of the ten directions to establish and circulate it. But evil monks... Master Ce says: Seventh, admonishing false beliefs.

Scripture: "At that time the sixteen..." up to "this is a world without Buddha"
Master Ce says: Second, clarifying acceptance and upholding. The text has two parts: first the kings sorrowfully accept the admonitions and uphold them; second the gods lament.

Scripture: "At that time countless..." up to "end of sutra"
The new version says: Maitreya, Lion Moon, and other countless bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, Śāriputra, Subhūti, and other countless śrāvakas... Master Ye says: Concluding the assembly, paying respects and withdrawing. Master Zang says: The assembly heard the dharma and joyfully practiced it. Master Ce says: Using the teaching for acceptance and upholding.

Fourth, Questions and Answers for Investigation: Question: The later translations of this sutra altogether have four versions: first, the Jin dynasty Dharmarakṣa translation in one scroll; second, the Yao Qin Kumārajīva translation in two scrolls; third, the Liang Paramārtha translation in one scroll; fourth, the Tang Amoghavajra translation in two scrolls.

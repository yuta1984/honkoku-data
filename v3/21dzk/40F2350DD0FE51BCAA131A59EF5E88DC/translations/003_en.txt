They employ these meanings. There are only other interpretations, but there is no leisure to elaborate on them extensively. In my private view, there is a saying by former worthies: The four characters "all arhats" should belong to the following sentence. That is, reading the text as "all possess the conditioned merits, unconditioned merits, ten knowledges of no-more-learners, eight knowledges of learners, etc., of arhats." Although the text is inconvenient, there is no fault in the meaning. Generally, the text of this sūtra should not follow the example of other sūtras. The ten knowledges of no-more-learners are: knowledge of suffering, knowledge of origination, knowledge of cessation, knowledge of the path, knowledge of dharma, knowledge of analogy, conventional knowledge, knowledge of others' minds, knowledge of exhaustion, and knowledge of no-rebirth. Regarding the eight knowledges of learners, according to one fascicle, persons of the third fruit have not yet attained knowledge of exhaustion and knowledge of no-rebirth. Master Jizang agrees. Regarding the six knowledges of learners, according to one fascicle, persons of the first two fruits have not yet attained fundamental concentration and lack knowledge of others' minds and conventional knowledge. Master Jizang says: The two persons of stream-enterer and once-returner exclude knowledge of others' minds, having not yet attained fundamental dhyāna. Therefore they exclude conventional knowledge. What existed previously is not newly obtained. The three roots, according to most masters, are the three uncontaminated roots. Regarding the sixteen mental states, Master Jizang and others say: The sixteen mental states are precisely the sixteen states including patience with the dharma of suffering. The sixteen practices are precisely the sixteen truth-contemplations of suffering, impermanence, etc. Master Dōeki and others separately discuss the mental states, merely pointing to the sixteen practices. Regarding dharma-provisional, empty-real contemplation, etc., Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: As in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā, first is dharma-provisional, meaning what can constitute the five aggregates, arising from conditions. Second is reception-provisional, meaning what is constituted by the aggregates. Continuity-provisional means receiving the five aggregates. Third is name-provisional, meaning having only names without real substance. Eliminating the three false provisionals and contemplating the principle of true characteristics is called empty-real contemplation. Master Jizang says: Dharmas such as the five aggregates are called dharma-provisional; the five aggregates constituting sentient beings is reception-provisional; taking the names upon these two provisionals is called name-provisional. Having no substance and depending on others is called provisional. Empty-real contemplation means: dharma-provisional is real, and the two provisionals are empty.

[Page 4, Lower]
Name-provisional is empty. Dharma and reception are real. Also presenting another interpretation: attachment becomes empty, forgetting and destroying objects becomes real. Master Dōeki says: The five aggregates are originally non-existent and falsely gather through conditions, hence called dharma-provisional. The loving mind falsely attaching is called reception-provisional; falsely grasping distinctions is called name-provisional. Due to awakening it is called provisional; due to delusion it is called real. Master Liangben says: Reception refers to the aggregate of sensation, savoring and being attached to birth-and-death, with only the power of sensation being strong. The three emptiness contemplation gates, all masters say, are emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. Next, the new version says: There are also eight hundred bhikṣuṇīs, all together being arhats.

Sūtra: There are also eight hundred million great sage pratyekabuddhas, neither eternalist nor nihilist, all accomplished in the Four Noble Truths and twelve links of dependent origination. (Not in the new version)

Second are the pratyekabuddhas. Regarding great sage pratyekabuddhas, according to one fascicle: Originally learning the Buddha-dharma, appearing in ages without buddhas, practicing the immortal way, because their spiritual roots matured, they became pratyekabuddhas. Master Jizang says: The first great pratyekabuddha, in his causal stage, was a king who took various court ladies into a garden for recreation. After briefly resting and sleeping, while not yet asleep, the forest was exquisite with luxuriant colored leaves. Suddenly the court ladies decayed. The king immediately reflected: "I too will soon be like this." Using the external to understand the internal, he immediately became a great pratyekabuddha. Hence called great sage pratyekabuddha. Second, after the Buddha departed from the world, dwelling quietly in a meditation hall, sitting in lotus posture, independently awakening and contemplating, suddenly achieving the way, this is called solitary-awakened pratyekabuddha. Third, there are seven-life stream-enterers who, relying on previous liberation-conducive wholesome roots, are reborn seven times in human and heavenly realms and, without receiving an eighth birth, immediately become lesser pratyekabuddhas. Among the three types of pratyekabuddhas, the first is greatest. Because they attain supernatural powers from dependent origination, they are called great sage pratyekabuddhas. Also it says: Question: Pratyekabuddhas appear in ages without buddhas. Why are they now among the fellow listeners? Answer: The various great sages in the snow mountains awakened to dependent origination and attained the way. Now hearing the Tathāgata emit light and shake the earth, they followed the light and came.

[Page 5, Upper]
Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: They constantly enjoy tranquility, like mountain dwellers, hence called great sages. There are three types of sages: first buddhas, second solitary awakened ones, third those with five supernatural powers. The Lotus Sūtra Commentary says: Those with natural wisdom do not seek to appear in the world simultaneously with buddhas, nor do they attain fruition after seeing buddhas. Hence, as stated in sūtras, when Śākyamuni appeared in the world, five hundred pratyekabuddhas came out from the mountains to the Buddha's place. Therefore, the Ninnō Sūtra contains an assembly of solitary awakened ones. They first completed the way and later encountered the World-Honored One. Unlike śrāvakas who attain the way at the Buddha's place.

Sūtra: There are also nine hundred million bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, all arhats, accomplished in all merits of real wisdom, skillful means wisdom, practicing the sole great vehicle, four eyes, five supernatural powers, three insights, ten powers, four immeasurable minds, four eloquences, four means of attraction, and vajra-like concentration of cessation.

The new version says: There are also countless, numberless bodhisattva-mahāsattvas with real wisdom equally and permanently severing the obstacles of afflictions, skillfully employing skillful means to generate great vow-practices. Third are the bodhisattvas. "All arhats" means, according to one fascicle: Most of these are in the fourth stage of reliance. Even if they have not yet reached the ten stages, they are still practicing arhats. Master Dōeki says: According to the text below, those who attain patient acceptance of non-arising at the seventh stage are called arhats. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: Separately praising merits makes ten categories: first, skillful means and true wisdom; second, practicing the sole great vehicle; third, four eyes; fourth, five supernatural powers; fifth, three insights; sixth, ten powers; seventh, four immeasurables; eighth, four eloquences; ninth, four means of attraction; tenth, vajra-like concentration of cessation. "Practicing the sole great vehicle" means, according to Master Wŏnch'ŭk: The Four Noble Truths and dependent origination are practiced by both great and small vehicles, but the six pāramitās are practiced only by bodhisattvas.

[Page 5, Lower]
Hence it is called "sole great vehicle." Either dharma-emptiness or unshared prajñā. Master Jizang says: Not mixing with the two vehicles is called practicing the sole great vehicle. Also, there are two types of bodhisattvas: first, those transformed through three vehicles; second, those of the pure great vehicle. The four eyes are physical, divine, wisdom, and dharma eyes, not yet having attained the Buddha-eye. The five supernatural powers are divine powers, divine eye, divine ear, knowledge of others' minds, and knowledge of past lives, excluding the power of ending outflows. The three insights are knowledge of past lives, divine eye, and ending of outflows. Master Dōeki explains the difference between powers and insights: Generally seeing phenomena is called supernatural power; penetrating the principles of causation and karma is called insight. I ask privately: Why do supernatural powers exclude the sixth while insights add the second? Answer: Master Jizang says: Logically, the three insights are what buddhas attain. Bodhisattvas, according to their capacity, aspire to and practice the Buddha's merits. Master Dōeki says: Presumably they harmonize their light, hence supernatural powers lack the sixth; real wisdom exhausts the source, hence insights include all three. Master Liangben says: Speaking in terms of their own stage, hence the three insights are taught. Generally discussing later stages, there is no ending of outflows. Regarding the ten powers, according to one fascicle: If cause and effect are not-two, bodhisattvas can also possess the Buddha's ten powers and four fearlessnesses. If not-two yet two, bodhisattvas have their own powers and fearlessnesses, as clarified in the Avataṃsaka. Master Jizang says: The bodhisattvas' ten powers are: first, power of firm resolve; second, power of great compassion; third, power of great loving-kindness; fourth, power of vigor; fifth, power of meditative concentration; sixth, power of wisdom; seventh, power of not being weary of saṃsāra; eighth, power of patient acceptance of non-arising dharmas; ninth, power of liberation; tenth, power of non-obstruction. Master Dōeki lists the ten powers including tenable and untenable positions. The four immeasurable minds are loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity. The four eloquences are dharma, meaning, expression, and delight. The four means of attraction are giving, kind speech, beneficial action, and cooperation. Regarding vajra-like concentration of cessation, Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: The final moment of the tenth stage can eliminate the two obstructions, hence called concentration of cessation. Vajra has two meanings: first, able to cut - as concentration, nothing cannot be broken, like vajra.

I have never spoken falsely. This morning when I went out from the palace, I saw a Taoist priest. He was begging from me in front of my carriage procession. I promised to give to him when I returned. Please have compassion and grant me seven days. After giving to that Taoist priest, I will return and face death." Spotted Foot immediately released him. When the king returned to his kingdom, the Taoist priest was there alone. He joyfully made offerings. The Brahmin explained verses for the king. (And so forth) It also says: The King Sudāsoma at that time is my present body. The Spotted Foot King is the present Aṅgulimāla. The various people who were devoured by Spotted Foot during those twelve years are these present people who were killed by Aṅgulimāla. These people have constantly been killed and harmed by Aṅgulimāla throughout lifetimes. Regarding the heretical teacher Rāhu and others:

Master Ben says: "Charnel ground" refers to the dwelling place. "Mahā" is translated as "great." "Kāla" means "black heaven." The upper phrase is Sanskrit, the lower phrase is Tang Chinese. The Great Black Heaven deity is a god of battle and war. If one worships this deity, it increases his divine power, and all undertakings are victorious. Therefore offerings are made. How do we know this? The Tripiṭaka Master quotes a separate Sanskrit text saying: The Peacock King Sutra explains that east of the capital city of Uśīra Kingdom there is a forest named Śmaśāna, which means "corpse forest." This forest extends one yojana in all directions. There is a Great Black Heaven deity, which is a transformed body of Maheśvara. Together with countless retinues of spirits and demons, he constantly roams through the forest during nighttime. He possesses great spiritual power and many precious treasures. He has invisibility medicine, longevity medicine, and various magical medicines for flying through the sky. He trades with people, only taking the blood and flesh of living humans. First agreeing on weights and measures, he trades for medicines and such. If people wish to go there, they must first use dhāraṇī to protect their bodies, then

go to trade. If they do not use protective mantras, those spirits and demons will hide themselves and steal human blood and flesh, causing the weight to decrease. They immediately take blood and flesh from that person's body. As they take, it disappears accordingly. It does not fulfill the prior agreement. Even taking all the blood and flesh of one person, if the weight is insufficient, the medicine cannot be obtained. If one uses protective mantras, they can obtain precious implements and various medicines. Whatever they wish to accomplish will be achieved. For those who make offerings, only human blood and flesh will do. If he has great power, he immediately protects people. Their actions become brave, and in battle and such methods they all achieve victory.

Scripture: "That King Pūrṇamaṇḍala" up to "patient acceptance of the unborn"
Examining Master Ce's meaning: The text explaining the ability to protect from difficulties has three parts. First, Pūrṇamaṇḍala requests leave. From "that Spotted Foot" below, second, granting leave for one day. If following the Bhadrakalpika Sutra, he grants seven days. From "At that time King Pūrṇamaṇḍala" below, third, being able to protect according to time.

Scripture: "That King Pūrṇamaṇḍala" up to "granted him one day"
I say: The two texts of requesting and granting can be understood.

Scripture: "At that time King Pūrṇamaṇḍala" up to "patient acceptance of the unborn dharma"
Master Ce says: Being able to protect according to time has two parts. First, based on what the seven Buddhas explained, clarifying the ability to protect. Later, from "that first dharma teacher" below, based on separate principles to clarify the ability to protect. Master Ye says: Lecturing on sutras twice daily for one day is completed. However, the hundred assemblies should be explained according to the length of days. Whether extensive or brief, all should complete the sutra. This is the standard.

【Page 73 Upper】
Master Ce says: Question - how can one explain such eight billion verses in one day? Answer: Because of the Tathāgata's spiritual power providing invisible support. Fascicle one says: The sutra says "traveling north ten thousand li to find King Pūrṇamaṇḍala," and then says "returning in one day to cultivate merit" - this is also an inconceivable matter of the noble path. Lecturing eight billion verses twice in one day, everyone hears all the meaning.

Scripture: "That first dharma teacher" up to "patient acceptance of the unborn dharma"
Master Ce says: The second part clarifies the ability to protect by following separate principles. The text has two distinct parts. First, properly explaining dharma protection. Later, from "at that time" below, hearing the dharma and obtaining benefit.

Scripture: "When the kalpa burning is finished" up to "how could there be a kingdom?"
Master Ce says: The second part properly explains dharma protection. There are eight lines of verses, immediately divided into four. The first two verses explain impermanence. The second two verses explain suffering. The third two verses explain emptiness. The fourth two verses explain no-self. All masters agree with this.

Scripture: "When the kalpa burning is finished" up to "what permanence does the kingdom have?"
The new translation says: The kalpa fire blazes completely, the great thousand-fold world all destroyed. Mount Sumeru and vast oceans are worn away without remainder. Brahmā, Śakra, dragons, and all sentient beings are all annihilated. Why fear this body? Master Ce says: The first verse explains the impermanence of the material world's kalpa destruction. The next half verse clarifies the impermanence of the physical body's one lifetime. The latter half verse raises the superior to compare with the inferior. "Qian" means heaven. "Qian" means strong. Because its movement is not forced, it is called qian. "Kun"

【Page 73 Lower】
means earth. "Kun" means compliant. Earth complies with the four seasons and nurtures all things, therefore it is called kun. Regarding the "two principles," Master Ce says heaven and earth. Master Ye agrees. Master Zang says yin and yang. Master Ye says: Conditioned phenomena flow and change moment by moment. Why wait until burning to be impermanent? This merely borrows phenomena to reveal principles and make them easy to understand.

Scripture: "Birth, aging, sickness, death" up to "what reliance does the kingdom have?"
The new translation says: Birth, aging, sickness, death, worry, grief, suffering, vexation, enemies and relatives pressing upon one, able to contradict wishes. Love, desire, and binding afflictions create their own sores and tumors. The three realms have no peace - what happiness does the kingdom have? Master Ce says: The first verse and a half properly clarifies various sufferings. Later there is half a verse raising the superior to compare with the inferior. "Matters going against wishes" and so forth - Master Ce says: Two lines apply to the three sufferings - namely suffering of association with the hated, suffering of separation from the loved, and suffering of not obtaining what is sought. All go against one's wishes. Or this refers to worry and grief causing harm. There are also two more lines clarifying the suffering of the five aggregates. Namely, desire belongs to the truth of origination. Heavy disasters are suffering and origination, like sores and tumors. Not departing from one's own body, not exiting the three realms, therefore called "without outside." Master Ye says: The sores and tumors of various sufferings are self-invited, not external. Master Zang's meaning regarding "without outside" agrees with this.

Scripture: "Existence fundamentally has no" up to "the kingdom and land are also thus"
The new translation says: The conditioned is unreal, arising from causes and conditions. Prosperity and decline turn like lightning, temporarily existing then immediately void. The various realms and destinies of birth appear according to karmic conditions. Like shadows, like echoes, all are empty. Master Ce says: The first verse clarifies dharma-emptiness. The second verse clarifies person-emptiness. "Sounds and echoes are all empty" and so forth uses the superior to compare with the inferior.

Scripture: "The consciousness-spirit has no form" up to "how could there be a kingdom?"
The new translation says: Consciousness drifts due to karma, arising dependent on the four elements. Bound by ignorance and craving, self and possessions arise. Consciousness migrates according to karma, the body has no master. One should know that kingdoms and lands are also thus illusory transformations. Master Ce says: The fourth two verses reveal

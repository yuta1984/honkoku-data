Master Zang says: There are four types of scattered flowers. First, scattering one hundred million flowers - these are flowers of the thirty minds of practice before the stages. Second, again scattering eighty-four thousand prajñā flowers - these are flowers of the first stage and above, the ten stages. Third, again scattering wonderful awakening flowers - these are flowers of the Buddha stage. Fourth, various heavenly beings scattering heavenly flowers. Master Ce also makes it three types. What the flowers represent is the same as before. The heavenly beings scattering flowers are included in the wonderful awakening flowers. Master Ce explains: These three types of flowers all establish their flower names from what they represent. Also saying: The seat represents the three worthy ones, being lowest. The platform represents the ten sages, because they transcend the contaminated. The city represents nirvana, being most supremely victorious. Also saying, the text of wonderful awakening flowers has four distinctions. First, various kings scatter flowers. Second, from "in empty space" below, the flowers transform into a city. Third, from "in the city" below, transformation Buddhas expound Dharma. Fourth, from "at that time the city" below, transformation beings scatter flowers, due to the superior power of the wonderful awakening flowers' merit and virtue. Therefore here there is triple scattering of flowers and double transformation manifestations. First, bodhisattvas scatter flowers forming a platform. Next, Buddhas and others in the platform scatter flowers forming a canopy. Finally, heavenly beings in the canopy scatter flowers like Ganges sands.

Master Ye says: The text of wonderful awakening flowers has three parts. First, scattering flowers to form a city, representing the dharmakāya preventing wrong. From "at that time in the city" below, scattering flowers to form a platform, representing wisdom prajñā transcending dust and defilement. From "in the platform, the ten directions" below, scattering flowers to form a canopy, representing great compassion responding to beings and sorrow covering the immeasurable.

Scripture: "At that time the kings" up to "pāramitā"
Master Zang says: The second major section is making vows.

Scripture: "The Buddha told the great king" up to "birthplace of spiritual powers"

【Page 76 Lower】
Master Zang says: The third major section is the Tathāgata's confirmation.

Scripture: "At that time the Buddha for the king" up to "worlds inconceivable"
Master Zang says: The fourth manifests spiritual power showing the five inconceivables. Master Ce explains the five inconceivables, presenting various masters' different interpretations, saying: First, one flower and many mutually entering. Second, Buddha-lands, one and many mutually entering. Third, Buddha-lands and pores, one and many mutually entering. Fourth, Mt. Sumeru and such, coarse and fine mutually entering. Fifth, ordinary and sage, internal and external mutually entering. Also saying: Question - Mt. Sumeru and great ocean entering into a mustard seed. Coarse and fine are contradictory. How can they enter? Answer: Western masters briefly make three explanations. First, all phenomena use suchness as their nature. Because the dependent suchness is separate from all characteristics, the dependently arising phenomena have no fixed large or small. Second, depending on the principle of consciousness-only, all phenomena do not depart from consciousness, following what the mind transforms, also having no fixed characteristics. Third, all phenomena's causal principle has no fixed characteristics. "Buddha body inconceivable" and such - Master Ce says: This is repeated praise. Combining the previous five transformations into three inconceivables. Buddha body is one Buddha body. Sentient beings are immeasurable sentient beings, bodies of the six paths. Worlds are the four elements and the previous four transformations of individual worlds. Excluding the four transformations, the remaining meaning is the same as before.

Scripture: "Buddha manifested supernatural powers" up to "spiritual power samādhi"
Master Zang says: The fifth major section clarifies obtaining benefit. Regarding heavenly beings in the ten directions obtaining Buddha flower samādhi, Master Zang says: This is the Flower Ornament samādhi that the tenth stage obtains. Ten Ganges sands of bodhisattvas manifesting bodily Buddhahood, three Ganges sands of eight groups of spirit kings accomplishing the bodhisattva path -

Masters Zang and Ye both say: First stage and above. Ten thousand women presently obtaining spiritual power samādhi - Master Zang says: The five spiritual powers.

Scripture: "Think well"
This concludes by encouraging cultivation.

Benevolent Kings Prajñāpāramitā Sutra, Chapter Seven: Receiving and Maintaining
Master Ye says: The first four chapters show the Dharma of two separations. Next, the Scattering Flowers chapter manifests powers to realize faith. Therefore this present chapter depends on faith to receive and maintain. It extensively explains the guidelines for internal and external dual protection and respectful maintenance. Therefore it is called the Receiving and Maintaining chapter. Master Ce says: According to the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom, through the power of faith, hearing and practicing respectfully is "receiving." Through the power of mindfulness, not losing for a long time is "maintaining."

Scripture: "At that time Light" up to "end of chapter"
Master Ce says: The text divides into three. First, clarifying internal protection and maintenance. Second, from "The Buddha told King Prasenajit, I shall" below, clarifying external protection and maintenance. Third, from "at that time all the great assembly" below, hearing Dharma and obtaining benefit. I say: First clarifying receiving and maintaining. Later from "at that time the sixteen" below, hearing Dharma and obtaining benefit.

Scripture: "At that time Moonlight" up to "not born in that country"
Receiving and maintaining has two parts. First, internal protection and maintenance. Second, external protection and maintenance.

Scripture: "At that time Moonlight" up to "equal without difference"

【Page 77 Lower】
Master Ye says: The first text has two parts. First, questions. Second, answers.

Scripture: "At that time Moonlight" up to "opening the path of empty dharma"
Master Ce says: Within the questions there are also two parts. First, seeing the three Buddhas gives rise to doubt. Second, addressing the Buddha to ask.

Regarding "seeing Śākyamuni" and such, regarding "inexplicable, incomprehensible, unknowable" - Master Ce says: If following the Original Record, because it transcends verbal expression it cannot be spoken. Because it transcends conceptual mind it cannot be understood. Because it transcends awareness and observation it cannot be known through consciousness. Master Zang's meaning agrees. Master Ye says: The question's meaning is that prajñā is profound and mysterious. Only Buddha exhausts its source. After the Tathāgata's extinction, who is capable of spreading and expounding it?

Scripture: "The Great Muni said" up to "equal without difference"
Master Ye says: The Buddha's answer text has three parts. First, general indication. Second, detailed explanation. Third, concluding encouragement.

Scripture: "The Great Muni said" up to "respectfully offering above"
General indication

Scripture: "Good son, that Dharma teacher" up to "saṃghadhāra stage"
Master Ye says: This second part separately explains thirteen Dharma teachers. This first is the Dharma teacher of practiced seed nature. Master Ce says: "That Dharma teacher" - first indicating the general name. From "practiced seed nature" below, next separately explaining the thirteen Dharma teachers. First explaining practiced seed nature. The text has five parts. First, indicating the distinct name of the stage. Second, from "if a householder" below, distinguishing categorical differences. Third, from "cultivating the ten good deeds" below, different practices and activities. Fourth, from "good son" below, raising the inferior to reveal the superior. Fifth, "being able to..."

Now I will first expound for all bodhisattvas the causes and conditions for protecting the Buddha fruit and the causes and conditions for protecting the practices of the ten stages. Listen carefully, listen carefully. Think well upon this and practice according to the Dharma. At that time King Prasenajit said: "Excellent! Due to this great matter's causes and conditions," he immediately scattered billions of varieties of colored flowers, which transformed into billions of jeweled canopy-covers over the great assembly.

Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: In the brief exposition there are four parts: first, knowing the king's intention in requesting; second, briefly opening the two protections; third, initially encouraging the development of the three wisdoms; fourth, joyful offering. Also he says: Briefly opening the two protections - first protecting the Buddha fruit, second protecting the ten stages. Here the Buddha fruit is what is protected, and the ten stages' prajñā is what protects, being able to generate the ten stages. Or perhaps the protective practices also extend to the ten stages, beginning from the first stage to generate the second stage, with each stage sequentially generating the next. The first fascicle says "the kings wish to ask about protecting the state," but the Buddha now first explains cause and effect because he is speaking precisely about what protects. Cause and effect are wisdom itself, and through wisdom one is able to protect the state. Up to the present text, first clarifying protecting the fruit and afterward clarifying protecting the causes - this again wishes to clarify that cultivation necessarily requires arousing the aspiration to first aspire to the supreme fruit, and only then cultivate the causes of the ten stages. Master Dōeki says: The Buddha-nature's great fruit lacks nothing. Love, views, and delusory dust may defile the various destinies. When wisdom's lamp turns back to illuminate, dust and delusion are all true. Bodhisattvas awaken themselves and also wish to awaken others, eternally ceasing delusory dust - this is called protecting the Buddha fruit. "Good" - the new version has "Excellent! Excellent!" Master Jizang says: "Good" means affirming what the Tathāgata has said. "Great matter" - Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: The Prajñāpāramitā Treatise says: "When the Buddha expounds prajñā, countless sentient beings will continue the Buddha-seed. This is the great matter's causes and conditions." Also citing the same treatise: "Being able to destroy sentient beings' great afflictions and give them the buddhas' unsurpassed great Dharma is called the great matter." From immediately scattering flowers to the jeweled canopy-covers over the great assembly - Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: This represents how the protective practices, when perfected, lead to supreme fruit, and when the protected fruit is fulfilled, it

covers and nurtures sentient beings.

Sūtra: At that time the great king again arose... to the end of the Two Truths chapter.

Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: In the second section of extensive explanation through questions and answers, there are two parts: first questions, then answers. The questions have two parts: first, the causes and conditions for protecting the Buddha fruit; second, the causes and conditions for protecting the practices of the ten stages. The answers have three parts: first, the Contemplating Emptiness chapter clarifies self-benefit practices, answering the previous question; next, the Teaching and Transformation chapter clarifies other-benefit practices, answering the second question; finally, the Two Truths chapter clarifies what the two truths depend upon. Master Dōeki's understanding is the same. In my analysis, it is broadly divided into six parts: first, questioning about protecting fruit and protecting causes; second, from "The Buddha said: Bodhisattvas..." to "Two Truths chapter... protecting the practices of the ten stages is like this," correctly clarifying protecting fruit and protecting causes (this follows Master Liangben's understanding); third, from "Addressing the Buddha: Immeasurable chapter" onward, clarifying that dharma-gates are neither one nor two; fourth, from "Great king, seven Buddhas" onward, praising the sūtra and encouraging its upholding; fifth, from "At that time the great assembly" onward, benefits from hearing the sūtra; sixth, from "Great king, this sūtra" onward, praising its name and encouraging its upholding.

Sūtra: At that time the great king again arose, made prostrations, and addressed the Buddha saying: "World-Honored One, how do all bodhisattvas protect the Buddha fruit? How do they protect the causes and conditions of the practices of the ten stages?"

The question can be understood.

Sūtra: The Buddha said: Bodhisattvas... to the end of the chapter.

Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: Regarding answering the first question, there are two parts: first, correctly explaining contemplating emptiness; second, the assembly's benefits. Master Dōeki says: The first text has four parts: first, correctly answering about protecting the fruit; second, from "Addressing the Buddha: If all..." onward, questions and answers for clarification; third, from "Great king, bodhisattvas..." onward, summarizing the protection of fruit; fourth, benefits from hearing the chapter.

[Page 17, Upper]
Sūtra: The Buddha said: When bodhisattvas transform the four births, they do not contemplate form as such, do not contemplate sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness as such, do not contemplate sentient beings, self, person, permanence, bliss, self, and purity as such, do not contemplate knowledge, views, and life-span as such, do not contemplate bodhisattvas as such, do not contemplate the six perfections, four means of attraction, and all practices as such, do not contemplate the two truths as such. Therefore, all dharma-nature is truly empty, not coming, not going, unborn, unceasing, identical to the true limit, equal to dharma-nature, without duality, without distinction, like space. Therefore, the aggregates, sense-bases, and elements have the characteristics of no-self and nothing possessed. This is called bodhisattvas practicing the transformation of the ten stages' prajñāpāramitā. Up to: Great king, bodhisattvas...

Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: In the preceding section there are two parts: first, correctly explaining contemplating emptiness; second, from "Great king, bodhisattvas..." onward, after the explanation, making a general conclusion. Also he says: From "Buddha, bodhisattvas..." to "all dharmas are thus." In the preceding section there are two parts: first, establishing the thesis and correct explanation; second, from "Addressing the Buddha..." onward, questions and answers for re-explanation. Regarding "Bodhisattvas transforming the four births do not contemplate form as such, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness as such," etc. - the new version says: "Those who protect the Buddha fruit, all bodhisattva-mahāsattvas should thus dwell and teach all egg-born, womb-born, moisture-born, and transformation-born beings, not contemplating form's characteristics, not contemplating form as such, sensation, perception, mental formations, consciousness, self, person, knowledge, views, permanence, bliss, self, purity, the inverted [views], four means of attraction, six perfections, two truths, four noble truths, powers, fearlessnesses, and all practices, up to bodhisattvas and tathāgatas likewise not contemplating characteristics and not contemplating as-such." According to Master Wŏnch'ŭk's understanding: The text on bodhisattvas transforming beings has four parts: first, generally indicating what transforms and what is transformed; second, from "not contemplating form..." onward, separately explaining the emptiness of what transforms and what is transformed; third, from "therefore all..." onward, concluding the establishment of the meaning of emptiness; fourth, from "this is called bodhisattvas..." onward, concluding the establishment of the protective essence. The second section explaining the emptiness of what is transformed has two parts: first, clarifying the two emptinesses of person and dharma in what is transformed; second, from "bodhisattvas..." onward, the two emptinesses of person and dharma in what transforms. "Not contemplating form as such," etc. is the dharma-emptiness of what is transformed. "Sentient beings, self, person," etc. is person-emptiness. "Bodhisattvas as such" is the person-emptiness of what transforms. "Six perfections" is dharma-emptiness. I say: The able and what is

[Page 17, Lower]
transformed being empty - interpreting the text is extremely skillful. Also, one could say "ordinary beings [realize] person-emptiness, bodhisattvas [realize] person-dharma emptiness." Regarding "not contemplating form as such," etc., most masters say it should fully read "not contemplating form, not contemplating form as such," and the remaining phrases follow this pattern. I say: This follows the new version. Regarding "Therefore all dharma-nature is truly empty," etc. - I say: Because dharma-nature itself is true reality, etc. Master Jizang says: All dharma-nature is an alternative name for true characteristics. I say: If so, then why does the text below say "equal to dharma-nature"? Would it say "dharma-nature equals dharma-nature"? Truly empty means not the emptiness understood by the two vehicles. Up to: Although there is no going and coming, there is clearly going and coming. "Identical to the true limit, equal..." - Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: Identical to the true limit is the suchness before the path; equal to dharma-nature is the suchness after the path. In explaining the Upholding chapter, Master Jizang says: Identical to the true limit means being identically united with non-attainment; equal to dharma-nature means knowing the non-duality of all dharmas. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: Identical to the true-suchness limit after the path, equal to the dharma-nature true-suchness before the path. Master Liangben says: Identical to the true limit means wisdom equals suchness; equal to dharma-nature means non-transformation. I say: The Prajñāpāramitā Treatise says: "In all dharmas there is nirvana-nature, this is called dharma-nature. All dharmas return to dharma-nature. This dharma-nature is called the true entry-place, called the limit." True limit and real limit are different names with the same meaning. "Aggregates, sense-bases, and elements having no-self and nothing-possessed characteristics" - the new version says "aggregate, base, and element characteristics are without self and what belongs to self." The first fascicle says: "In breaking attachment to existence, first break self, then break what belongs to self." "Practicing the transformation of ten stages' prajñā," etc. - the new version says "cultivating prajñāpāramitā." Master Dōeki says: Although mentioning the ten stages, at the end of the following chapter it concludes with Buddha fruit. Because cause and fruit are protected together, it concludes thus. If following Master Jizang's understanding: here first answering about protecting fruit, next "identical to the true limit" answers the question about protecting causes. From "this is called..." onward concludes the answer to the above question about protecting causes. In my analysis of the new and old sūtras along with various masters' explanatory understandings: this chapter clarifies protecting fruit, so this interpretation is not yet acceptable. However, regarding the meaning of protecting Buddha fruit, the sūtra text is not clear. Now I think: the old version names it "Contemplating Emptiness Chapter," the new version names it "Contemplating

There are two [aspects]. First is the supported (āśraya); second is the supporter (āśrayāṇa). The supported has three: first is the land; second is the seat; third is the flowers. The supporter has four: first is the Buddha; second are bodhisattvas; third are monks; fourth are the eight divisions. The text on repeated transformation has two sections. First clarifying the assembly of the multitude; later clarifying the multitude's exposition of the sūtra. Master Dōeki says the text has four parts: first listing the manifested flower-seats; second listing the transformation buddhas and great assembly; third listing the lands; fourth [from] "like now, each land" below, the dharma being expounded. Master Jizang says the text has three parts: first clarifying the land capable of transformation; second from "there are countless..." below clarifying the buddhas and bodhisattvas capable of manifestation; third from "each buddha..." below clarifying the capability of expounding prajñā. I, following the new version and reconciling with the old sūtra, say: First transforming the pure lands of the ten directions, therein also manifesting hundreds of millions of high seats, in front of those hundreds of millions of seats each manifesting one Mount Sumeru jewel flower. On those seats and preceding flowers there are countless transformation buddhas. The new version says there are buddhas on the seats expounding dharma. Now it comprehensively combines seats and flowers saying "there are countless transformation buddhas." Otherwise, would those seats have no masters? Also there are countless bodhisattvas, monks, eight divisions, etc., sitting together with the transformation buddhas on the flowers in front of the seats. The next text saying "on all flowers there are countless lands, etc." seems to indicate that besides the buddhas and bodhisattvas on the flowers in front of those seats, there are [additional] lands with buddhas and bodhisattvas. Hence Master Wŏnch'ŭk creates the interpretation of repeated transformation. However, Masters Jizang, Dōeki, etc. do not speak of repeated transformation because this follows the new version. Or perhaps saying "on the flowers there are countless lands, etc." all further clarify the lands upon which the previously mentioned buddhas and bodhisattvas on the flowers depend. The meaning is: previously saying "on flowers there are buddha-lands" means there are lands and within them are buddhas and bodhisattvas. The textual meaning is difficult to evaluate. Those who see this should consider well.

Sūtra: Assemblies from other directions and transformation assemblies, multitudes within these three realms, twelve great assemblies all come and gather, sitting

[Page 10, Lower]
on nine-tiered lotus seats, their assembly extending 950 li square, the great multitude sitting uniformly.

This is the general conclusion. Regarding the nine tiers: Master Jizang says these are nine-layered flower seats. My record says "tier" (jie) means "level" (ji) and "layer" (ceng). Regarding "uniformly" (qianran): Master Jizang says it means "all together thus."

Sūtra: At that time, the Buddha Śākyamuni of ten epithets, three knowledges, great extinction truth, vajra wisdom, on the eighth day of the first month, just sitting in the ten grounds, entering the great tranquil chamber samādhi, contemplating conditions and emitting great light illuminating the three realms, again from his crown producing a thousand jewel lotus flowers, the flowers reaching up to Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception Heaven, the light likewise so, extending to other-direction buddha lands numerous as Ganges sands. At this time the formless realm rained countless transformed great fragrant flowers, fragrance like cart wheels, flowers like Mount Sumeru king, descending like clouds. The eighteen Brahmā heavenly kings rained hundreds of variously colored flowers. The six desire heavens rained countless colored flowers. In front of the Buddha's seat naturally grew 900 million tier-flowers reaching up to Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception Heaven. At this time in the world, the earth shook in six ways, continuing to the end of the chapter.

This is the specific prologue. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: The second is the originating prologue. The text has five parts: first, the Tathāgata's manifestation of auspicious signs; second, the great assembly's doubts and questions; third, awakening the Tathāgata; fourth, the Buddha ascending the flower seat; fifth, the great assembly's joy. The various masters are not clear, hence I do not elaborate extensively. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: The first manifestation of auspicious signs has five parts in the text: first, praising the Tathāgata's virtue; second, the time of manifesting auspicious signs; third, properly abiding in the ten grounds; fourth, entering great tranquil concentration; fifth, contemplating conditions and manifesting auspicious signs. Also saying the fifth contemplating conditions and manifesting auspicious signs has five parts in the text: first, contemplating conditions and emitting light; second, producing flowers from the crown; third, heavenly beings raining flowers; fourth, Buddha-flowers spontaneously arising; fifth, the great earth's six movements. Regarding the ten epithets... Regarding the three knowledges... Regarding great extinction truth: Masters Jizang and Dōeki call this the virtue of elimination. Regarding vajra wisdom:

[Page 11, Upper]
Masters Jizang and Dōeki call this the virtue of wisdom. The first fascicle says: Wanting to clarify that extinction and wisdom are not different - nirvāṇa clarifying ultimate emptiness is called wisdom. Regarding the eighth day of the first month: The first fascicle says it is the eighth day of the first month of the thirtieth year. Master Jizang says: In the thirty-sixth year after enlightenment, on the eighth day of the first month, he expounded this sūtra. Seven years after enlightenment he began expounding other prajñā [sūtras]. Examining various textual records, twenty-nine years to the present time should be thirty-six years after enlightenment - at age sixty-six after birth-enlightenment he expounded this sūtra. In my view, this depends on enlightenment at thirty. But "enlightenment age sixty-six" probably refers to his birth age. Master Dōeki says: Master Paramārtha says the Tathāgata taught people for forty-five years. The dharma wheel has manifest and secret [aspects]. The manifest divides into three dharma wheels: The Buddha in the first seven years after enlightenment turned the dharma wheel; in the next thirty-one years turned the illuminating dharma wheel; in the latter seven years turned the maintaining dharma wheel. The secret has no fixed [pattern]. This sūtra was expounded in the thirty years of the illuminating-turning dharma wheel - namely expounded on the eighth day of the first month thirty-seven years after enlightenment. My record, after citing the true three dharma wheels, says: This means this sūtra was expounded thirty-seven years after enlightenment - thus the Buddha's birth age was seventy-one years. Master Liangben says: In this region four seasons each have three months. The imperial Tang calendar establishes Yin as the first [month]. The western countries have three seasons, each season having four months. The beginning of the cold season corresponds to the eleventh month, same as ancient times establishing Zi as first. The dark half marks nothing. The twenty-third day is precisely the eighth. Like establishing four seasons as in Suvarṇaprabhāsa chapter nine. As the Xiyuji volume two says: From the sixteenth day of the first month to the fifteenth day of the fourth month are the three spring months. Namely the twenty-third day of the first month is the eighth day of the first month. In my view, here one should investigate the timing of Tiantai's five-period teaching doctrine.

Regarding "just sitting in the ten grounds": The first fascicle says: About to expound the ten-ground prajñā, therefore one must concentrate the mind to gradually illuminate this dharma, showing that those with scattered minds cannot engage in verbal explanation. Master Jizang says: When the causes are perfected then one attains buddhahood - this is called "just sitting in the ten grounds." This refers back to former causes, not beginning to sit. Also saying these are the Buddha's ten grounds: First, the extremely profound, difficult to know, extensively illuminating wisdom-virtue ground; Second, the pure body inconceivable ground; Third, the ocean treasury ground; Fourth, the spiritual power wisdom-virtue ground; Fifth, the bright virtue ground; Sixth, the stainless flame light revealing characteristics ground; Seventh, the extensively victorious dharma-realm treasury illuminating realm ground; Eighth, the unobstructed wisdom ground; Ninth, the limitless hundred million adorned dedication capable-of-illuminating ground; Tenth, the Vairocana wisdom treasury ground. These grounds appear in the Ekaputra Sūtra. Regarding entering the great tranquil chamber samādhi: The new version says "entering great tranquil wondrous samādhi." Regarding contemplating conditions: Master Jizang says: This is the condition for the arising of the great teaching - great wisdom clearly examining, hence called "contemplating conditions." Another interpretation: contemplating signless meaning, taking suchness dharma-nature principle as condition. Master Dōeki says: contemplating the conditions to be taught. Regarding emitting great light, etc.: The new version says "from the pores of the body emitting great light universally illuminating the ten directions' Ganges-sand buddha lands." Master Jizang says: wanting to have them break through ignorance darkness and attain wisdom brightness. Regarding the Buddha's crown producing flowers: The first fascicle says this represents the ten-ground prajñā emerging from the Buddha. Master Dōeki says: representing the exposition of prajñā dharma - lotus flowers give birth to the buddhas of the three times. This is the mother of all buddhas, honored at the Tathāgata's crown. Regarding "reaching up to neither-perception": Master Jizang says this is where the flowers reach. This sūtra clarifies that the formless realm has form. Master Dōeki says: representing the characteristic of supreme transcendence. Regarding "the light likewise so": Master Jizang says this is the same as the flowers. In my view: Question - does this flower refer to the previous light? If so, the text seems confused. If it is separate light, when is it emitted? Regarding "extending to other-direction Ganges-sand lands": Master Jizang says: not only illuminating this direction but also pervading the ten directions. The formless realm raining countless transformed great fragrant flowers, fragrance like cart wheels

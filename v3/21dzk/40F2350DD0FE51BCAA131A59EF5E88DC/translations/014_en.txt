Regarding karmic retribution emptiness: up to now, the primary [afflictions] of the five stages have been clarified. This refers to the habitual tendencies of ignorance.
Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: Now relying on the Tripiṭaka Master Cien to explain this text. The meaning naturally has two sections. The initial "three grounds, nine births cease" encompasses the boundaries of the grounds. Namely, within the three grounds eight, nine, and ten, all have the three birth-cessations of beginning, dwelling, and ending, which can be called nine births-cessations. Why is this so? Within the previous seven grounds there are naturally two meanings: first, receiving fragmentary birth. Therefore the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom says: seventh-ground bodhisattvas receive worm bodies and flesh bodies. One category of bodhisattvas from the first ground onward receive transformational [birth]. Therefore the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom says: entering the first ground without abandoning the flesh body. From the eighth ground onward, all afflictions do not manifest, therefore only receiving transformational [birth]. Hence saying "three grounds, nine births cease." "Within the previous three realms, remaining ignorance habitual fruits are empty" - this distinguishes fruits in relation to conditions. Namely, as the Śrīmālā Sūtra explains, using the ground of ignorance-dwelling as condition, one attains three types of mental birth-bodies. Therefore it says "remaining ignorance karmic retribution emptiness." Master Dōeki says: fragmentary [birth-death] before the seventh ground is completely destroyed; the eighth, ninth, and tenth grounds each have three births, therefore called nine. Master Liangbian agrees with this. I say: many masters say that "three grounds, nine births cease" etc. refers to the eighth, ninth, and tenth grounds - the transformational birth-cessation of the ten grounds' three minds. Now examining the verse text below, explaining the lower patience of cessation, it concludes saying "equal wisdom, consecration, three grades of persons eliminate previous remaining habitual ignorance conditions." Also, the three births of each ground are evident in the sūtra text. Also, the new version says "conditioned arising-ceasing, transformational karmic retribution." Therefore taking the birth-cessation from the eighth ground onward somewhat accords with the sūtra's meaning. The new version here does not point to ground stages. Scholars should think well. Regarding "vajra bodhisattva" etc., the first fascicle says: "Below separately clarifies the tenth ground. The text has two parts: first clarifies birth-death emptiness; later clarifies Buddha-fruit emptiness." I say:

[Page 26, Lower]
Explaining the tenth ground points to the vajra mind. There are examples in the following text. However, adding Buddha-fruit emptiness within causes is not yet clear.
Master Dōeki says: raising cultivation and realization for explanation. In this sūtra, near-enlightenment takes the tenth-ground bodhisattva as vajra. Because it exhausts the source of ignorance, it uses this metaphor. "Attaining the samādhi of principle-exhaustion" means thoroughly investigating the principle of true characteristics and exhausting ignorance habits, therefore receiving this name. Since vajra can exhaust habits, it clearly shows that deluded habits are empty by nature. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: explaining the reason for emptiness has the same meaning as the previous master. I say: although there is no near-enlightenment among the fourteen patiences, the final mind of the tenth ground is the vajra mind, which is precisely near-enlightenment. As the new version says: "The near-enlightenment bodhisattva attains vajra concentration." Also, the verse below says: "Initially entering vajra, understanding everything; twenty-nine births are permanently transcended." This then separately takes the final birth from among the three births of the tenth ground as the vajra stage. This does not prevent this stage from also being called near-enlightenment. Regarding "delusion-fruit birth-cessation empty, existence-fruit empty, empty because causes are empty," the first fascicle says: "Delusion-fruit birth-cessation emptiness means contemplating delusion-fruits' birth-cessation as immediately empty. Later saying 'existence-fruits and causes are empty' - previously separately clarified delusion-fruit birth-cessation emptiness; now generally concludes cause-fruit emptiness. It can also be said that previously [the text] clarified accumulated causes-fruits, now clarifies karmic causes-fruits." Master Jizang says: because of subtle habits, it says delusion. Delusion means all afflictions; fruits means the three realms and all fruits outside the realms. Birth-cessation means the emptiness of the unobstructed path. Therefore the Necklace [Sūtra] says: "The near-enlightenment bodhisattva and the wonderfully awakened Buddha differ by birth-cessation. This clarifies the dharma-body carrying birth-cessation." The truth of suffering being without characteristics is called "existence-fruit emptiness"; the truth of accumulation being without arising is called "cause emptiness." Master Dōeki says: "delusion-fruit birth-cessation emptiness" is the habitual fruits of ignorance. Existence-fruits are habitual karma. Causes are habitual afflictions. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: delusions are afflictions that generate karma; fruits are the generated karma. Such delusion-karma all have birth-cessation; generally explained as empty. Existence-

[Page 27, Upper]
fruit emptiness means the three existences and transformational fruits produced by delusion-karma. "Empty because causes are empty" repeatedly explains the reason for fruit emptiness. I say: the sūtra text is unclear, and the masters' explanations are likewise. Now secretly investigating: delusion-fruits are perhaps what the Awakening of Faith treatise clarifies as karma-consciousness - namely the initial moment of consciousness explained in this sūtra. This consciousness is only what ignorance draws forth, not what karma induces. Therefore, in contrast to karma's fruits, it is called delusion's fruits. In the position of transmigration, it becomes the very first of birth-cessation; in the position of return-cessation, it becomes the very last of birth-cessation. After this mind ceases, one realizes permanent dwelling fruits. Separately called "delusion-fruit birth-cessation." Existence-fruits are fruits summoned by karma. In contrast to the previous delusion-fruits, they are called existence-fruits. Karma is called existence, as explained in the twelve links of dependent origination. Those existence-fruits, if spoken of separately, point to the final birth of the dharma-cloud ground; if spoken of generally, point to the various fruits of two deaths. "Empty because causes are empty" reveals the meaning of two-fruit emptiness. Why are they empty? Because of attaining the samādhi of principle-exhaustion. The meaning is: the samādhi of principle-exhaustion extinguishes all delusions and karma, therefore causes are empty. Since causes are already empty, fruits are also empty. The new version says "causes and fruits of two deaths are empty." One can think according to this. Regarding "sarvajña is also empty" etc., Master Liangbian says: all-knowledge is the wisdom that can eliminate. Both that capable and the eliminated have no inherent nature, therefore saying "also empty." Master Jizang's meaning says: up to now, defiled dharma emptiness has been clarified. Now pure dharma emptiness is clarified. Sarvajña emptiness is wisdom-virtue emptiness; cessation-fruit emptiness is elimination-virtue emptiness. Also bodhi emptiness and nirvāṇa emptiness. Regarding "delusions were already empty before," Master Jizang says: even when not eliminating afflictions, [they are] originally ceased. I say: this describes the reason for the previous cessation-fruit emptiness. However, this sūtra takes Buddha-fruit as the all-knowledge stage, therefore sarvajña is also empty. What follows accords with interpreting the text in terms of Buddha-fruit. However, the new and old versions seemingly explain the vajra-mind stage at first glance. Also, the old

[Page 27, Lower]
version next explains Buddha-fruit emptiness and has sarvajña emptiness. Therefore, taking this text as temporarily belonging to the above sentence. Master Liangbian's meaning is the same. Readers may accept or reject [these interpretations].

Sūtra: Buddha attains the three unconditioned fruits: cessation through wisdom, cessation not through wisdom, space - sarvajña fruit is also empty.

The new version says: "Buddha's unsurpassed awakening, comprehensive wisdom perfect. Analytical and non-analytical cessation, true pure dharma-realm, nature and characteristics equal - applications are also empty." The first fascicle says: "The fourth separately clarifies Buddha-fruit. Vajra eliminates bonds; Buddha realizes the unconditioned. This is cessation through wisdom. Cessation not through wisdom means: using the vajra reward-mind, requiring this sequence to draw subsequent fruits - what should arise but does not arise is also cessation not through wisdom." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: cessation through wisdom is also called analytical cessation; cessation not through wisdom is also called non-analytical cessation - cessation attained not through the power of wisdom. Like the previously explained natural purity nirvāṇa etc. Saying "space" means the meaning of no form manifestation upon true-suchness. Master Jizang says: dharma-nature space unconditioned. I say: the one section from "three grounds, nine births" onward - correlating sūtra text with various stages, masters disagree; not yet knowing which is correct. Scholars should think well.

Sūtra: Good son, if there is cultivation and practice of listening and explaining - no listening, no explaining, like space - dharma is the same as dharma-nature, listening is the same as explaining, all dharmas are likewise thus.

The new version says: "Good son, if there is cultivation and practice of prajñāpāramitā, speakers and listeners are like phantom persons. No explaining, no listening - dharma is the same as dharma-nature, like space. All dharmas are likewise thus." Master Dōeki says: cultivating with listening yet no listening, explaining yet no explaining is called true cultivation-practice of listening and explaining. Master Jizang's meaning seems

Practicing in upper patience is called sarvajña (the new translation says: reaching upper patience is called omniscience). Together observing the ultimate truth, severing the mind-habits and ignorance of the three realms to exhaustion, taking the characteristics as diamond, making exhausted-characteristics and no-characteristics into sarvajña, transcending conventional truth and ultimate truth, beyond these is the eleventh ground sarvajña-awakening. Neither existent nor non-existent, perfectly clear and pure, etc. (the new translation says: one characteristic and no-characteristic, equal and non-dual, is the eleventh omniscience ground. Neither existent nor non-existent, perfectly clear and pure). Diamond samādhi - Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Diamond has two meanings. First, the wisdom that can sever is called diamond because it can sever all afflictions. Second, the delusions to be severed are called diamond because they are as difficult to sever as diamond." Together observing the ultimate truth - Master Dōeki says: "Although illuminating principle is the same, because grades are divided into higher and lower, they observe together. Conventional truth and ultimate truth - illuminating this non-duality is provisionally called the third middle way ultimate truth. Therefore this middle way is no different from the previous meaning of equally illuminating the two truths. To distinguish from the two vehicles that eliminate the conventional and grasp the ultimate, therefore it is not the middle." I say: "If we follow Tiantai's intention, prajñā has three teachings. This interpretation corresponds to the shared teaching and does not accord with the distinct and perfect principles." Mind-habits and ignorance - the first fascicle says: "Previously, no-arising patience severed the accumulations of form-mind etc. of the three realms. Now it only refers to severing mind-accumulations, because mind is subtle." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "In the previous stages, the coarse habits of the two types - form and mind - were already severed. Now in this stage, the subtle habits of the two types - form and mind - are also severed. To show that what is severed is most subtle, it is only called mind-habits." Master Dōeki says: "These very habitual energies are also called ignorance, therefore they are combined." Master Wŏnch'ŭk adds the following phrase and quotes "ignorance exhausted-characteristics." I say: "The new translation says 'ignorance characteristics,' so although Master Wŏnch'ŭk's quoted text differs in wording, the meaning seems to be exhausted-characteristics." Taking as diamond, making exhausted-characteristics and no-characteristics into sarvajña - this passage is unclear and there are many different interpretations. Let me present one or two. The first fascicle says: "Diamond delusions are severed to exhaustion, yet wisdom and virtue are still

[Page 36, Lower]
characterized. Therefore it says exhausted-characteristics become diamond. The final mind of diamond is not merely the exhaustion of delusions. Wisdom and virtue are also the same - because the true characteristic is no-characteristic, it is called exhausted-characteristics and no-characteristics. This wishes to clarify that Buddha does not sever. Diamond is opposed to delusion; the antidote is still characterized. Because Buddha's essence merges with the ultimate, it receives the designation of no-characteristics. Therefore the text below says only Buddha alone can see principle." Master Dōeki says: "The characteristic of ignorance's extinction and exhaustion becomes dharma-cloud; when exhausted-characteristics also depart, it is called Buddha-fruit." Master Jizang says: "Exhausted-characteristics means ultimately able to destroy the causes and effects of birth-death. Exhausted-characteristics and no-characteristics means not merely exhausting characteristics but also exhausting no-characteristics - namely, conditioned observation together becomes hidden, and object-knowledge both become quiescent." Master Wŏnch'ŭk presents two interpretations. He explains: "At the time of the uninterrupted path, although delusion-characteristics are exhausted, there are still different characteristics of object and knowledge. Therefore it is not called no-characteristics. In this stage, ignorance-characteristics are exhausted and there are also no different characteristics of object and knowledge. Therefore it is called exhausted-characteristics and no-characteristics. Although there are two interpretations, for now we follow the latter explanation." I say: "The new version explains lower patience as severing ignorance-characteristics, and explains upper patience as all no-characteristics. Therefore we know exhausted-characteristics is the diamond mind, correctly severing the final grade of delusion-characteristics. At that time delusion and wisdom are in opposition and have not yet been given the name of no-characteristics. Exhausted-characteristics and no-characteristics is precisely the Buddha stage. Having exhausted all characteristics, there is only no-characteristics. The receiving and upholding chapter below takes only Buddha-fruit as the stage of seeing principle. The meaning lies in this." From transcending conventional truth to sentient beings' fundamental karma, Master Dōeki says: "Separately explaining the three bodies of Buddha-fruit. The text accordingly becomes three parts. First is the reward-body, next from 'perfectly clear' below is the dharma-body, later from 'unconditioned' below is the response-body." I say: "Explaining the three bodies - this principle is reasonable. However, establishing the three bodies differs among sutras. This sutra calls it 'transformation-dharma-body,' which differs slightly in name and meaning from dharma-reward-response. Students should know this." Transcending etc. - Master Jizang says: "Because of realizing the middle way one-reality truth, it is called going beyond the two truths. The ten grounds

[Page 37, Upper]
are learning-fruit. Buddha's eleventh ground is no-learning fruit. Cutting off characteristics, it is not existent. Complete in virtue, it is not non-existent." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Transcending the three worthies, therefore transcending conventional truth. Transcending the ten grounds, therefore transcending ultimate truth. Transcending conventional truth, therefore non-existent. Transcending ultimate truth, therefore non-non-existent." Master Dōeki says: "What is severed becomes conventional truth, what is cultivated becomes ultimate truth. Realizing the non-duality of severing and attaining is transcendence. Also, provisional wisdom illuminating existence becomes conventional truth, true wisdom illuminating the ultimate becomes ultimate truth. The non-duality of the two illuminations is transcendence. Also, benefiting others becomes conventional truth, self-benefit becomes ultimate truth. Ultimately illuminating the non-duality of self and others is transcendence. Only awakening is neither existent nor non-existent." I say: "If following Tiantai, one should explain this passage through the three teachings and being gathered in. However, now provisionally following the new version: equal awakening still has ignorance-characteristics, therefore it can be called existent. Immediately severing that, therefore it can be called non-existent. Therefore the causal stage belongs to the two extremes. Buddha-fruit, having severed, is neither existent nor non-existent. Ignorance is precisely illumination; one characteristic being equal is transcending the two." Master Jizang's meaning is the same. Therefore explaining the above passage about severing mind-habits of the three realms, he says: "Observing the emptiness truth in the ultimate unobstructed path, severing mind-wisdom ignorance to exhaustion." This explanation is excellent. Sarvajña-awakening etc. - Master Wŏnch'ŭk quotes the sutra saying sarvajña-awakening. Master Dōeki uses the character "awakening" to head "neither existent nor non-existent" (worth considering). Sarvajña-awakening - Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "There are two explanations. One says: sarvajña is called omniscience, sarvajña is called all-species wisdom. If following the basic record, all are translated as omniscience." Master Dōeki explains the passage below: "Sarvajña here means all-species wisdom." Observing this textual flow, it seems sarvajña explains original awakening nature while sarvajña explains initially awakened cultivated and perfected wisdom. However, I have not yet seen a correct translation and explanation. From unconditioned below, Master Dōeki says: "In this passage there is one section establishing the transformation essence."

[Page 37, Lower]
Second, from "good sons" below clarifies the realm of transformation. Third, from "all Buddhas' response-transformations" below clarifies the one who transforms. Fourth, distinguishing orthodox from heterodox. From "therefore I say" below shows the heterodox; from "Great King, I constantly" below describes the orthodox. "The afflictions of all sentient beings do not transcend the three-realm store; the fruition of all sentient beings, the twenty-two faculties, do not transcend the three realms" (the new translation says: all classes of sentient beings, all afflictions, karmic retribution-fruit, twenty-two faculties do not transcend the three realms). The first fascicle says: "This sutra does not yet explain matters outside the three realms. It is still a concealed-characteristic explanation. Also it says: when treatises speak of transformation birth-death existing outside the three realms, this treatise is not bound to the three existences, therefore called 'outside.' If discussing location, it does not transcend the domain of the three realms." Master Jizang says: "The three realms have two types: first is fragmentary, second is transformational." Master Wŏnch'ŭk presents different interpretations, saying: "Tripitaka Master Cien makes such an explanation. Transformational birth-death has no separate karmic fruit. It immediately depends on the karmic fruits possessed by the three realms. Through boundary-limit concentration, it becomes increasingly superior and marvelous, therefore called transformational." Master Dōeki says: "Delusions have coarse and subtle, retributions have pure and defiled. How could there separately be pure lands outside the three realms?" I say: "Different interpretations are like this, not according with the sutra's meaning. As detailed in the citation of the Awakening of Faith treatise below." "The response-transformation dharma-bodies of all Buddhas also do not transcend the three realms" (the new translation says: all Buddhas' guidance and instruction, response-transformation dharma-bodies also do not separate from this). Master Jizang says: "Speaking of the sentient beings to be transformed, therefore saying they do not transcend the three realms. If speaking truly, the three realms are originally pure. What transcending or not transcending is there?" Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Although Buddha's three bodies are not the three realms, they are also within the three realms, therefore saying they do not transcend." Master Dōeki says: "A good doctor does not dwell in places without illness and does not treat inevitably fatal diseases. Because of diseased places, therefore not transcending the three realms; because they can be liberated, and for the sake of expounding dharma, response-transformation Buddhas constantly dwell in the three realms." The non-Buddhist Great Existence Sutra - Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "The Vaiśeṣika non-Buddhists' Great Existence Sutra explains this. They explain the six categories of meaning: first is substance, second is

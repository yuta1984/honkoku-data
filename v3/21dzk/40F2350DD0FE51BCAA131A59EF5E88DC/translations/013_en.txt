Sūtra: Great King, if a bodhisattva sees objects, sees wisdom, sees explanations, sees reception, this is not holy vision. It is the dharma of inverted conceptual vision, ordinary people. Up to all dharmas are likewise thus.

Master Dōeki says: the second raises delusion to conclude the previous three prajñās. The text has three parts: first is general conclusion; second is separate explanation from "seeing the three realms" onward; third is encouraging contemplative practice from "good son, if there is" onward. I say: "seeing the three realms" etc., in response to "seeing objects, seeing wisdom," clarifies true-form contemplation. "If there is practice" etc., in response to "seeing explanations, seeing reception," clarifies textual prajñā. Master Dōeki says: seeing objects means seeing characteristics, not true form. Seeing wisdom means seeing discriminative wisdom, not contemplation. Seeing explanations and reception means attachment to written words. I say: using objects, wisdom, and explanations to correspond to the three prajñās in interpreting the text is very skillful. If separating explanations and reception: explanations are Buddha's teachings, reception is listening and receiving. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: seeing objects means seeing true form; seeing wisdom means seeing contemplation; seeing explanations means seeing textual prajñā; seeing reception means having attachments among various objects, therefore not holy vision. I say: Master Dōeki considers all four seeings as attached views; Master Wŏnch'ŭk considers three seeings as correct and seeing reception as attachment. Though both interpretations are without fault, Master Dōeki's seems more in accord with the text.

Sūtra: Seeing the three realms is the name of sentient beings' karmic retribution. The immeasurable desires and endless [cravings] arising from the six consciousnesses are called the desire realm. The karmic fruits arising from form [attachments] in the ālaya-consciousness delusions are called the form realm. The karmic fruits arising from formless ālaya-consciousness delusions are called the formless realm. Ālaya emptiness, three-realm emptiness, and the fundamental ignorance ālaya of the three realms are also empty.

The new version says: "The karmic retribution of sentient beings in the three realms is illusory. The various karmas created by discriminations of the desire realm, the karmas created by the four form meditative concentrations,

[Page 24, Lower]
the karmas arising from the four formless concentrations - the karmic fruits of the three existences are all empty. The fundamental ignorance of the three realms is also empty." Master Dōeki says: extensively going through all dharmas for separate explanation. The text has three parts: first clarifies emptiness of primary afflictions; second clarifies emptiness of habitual tendencies; third is Buddha-fruit emptiness. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: first is birth-and-death emptiness. This again has two: first is fragmentary birth-and-death emptiness; second is transformational birth-and-death emptiness. Later, from "sarvajña" onward is Buddha-fruit emptiness. The first fascicle says: "Here there are four: first generally clarifies how [stages] from the sixth ground and before contemplate three-realm emptiness. From 'three grounds, nine births' onward, the second generally clarifies how the three grounds seven, eight, and nine contemplate emptiness of ignorance accumulation. From 'vajra bodhisattva' onward, the third separately clarifies how the tenth ground contemplates emptiness of all dharmas. From 'Buddha attains three unconditioned' onward, the fourth separately clarifies the emptiness attained in Buddha-fruit. Up to the sixth ground correctly cuts off three-realm afflictions, therefore combined as one. From the seventh through ninth grounds, they similarly treat remaining accumulated ignorance. Since learning and understanding have not reached their limit and their characteristics are roughly similar, they are grouped together as one section. The tenth ground's final mind exhausts understanding. Cause and effect then differ from before, therefore separately forming one level. Since Buddha has reached the ultimate in cutting off accumulations, clearly different from before." Regarding "seeing the three realms is the name of sentient beings' karmic retribution," both Master Dōeki and Master Wŏnch'ŭk clarify that within three-realm emptiness there are three aspects: fruit emptiness, karma emptiness, and affliction emptiness. Master Dōeki says: since the illusory karma of three-realm sentient beings receiving retribution is already illusory, how could it not be empty? Master Wŏnch'ŭk's meaning says: contemplating the three realms, there are only fruit-names without actual substance. Regarding "six consciousnesses arise" etc., both masters say: second clarifies karma emptiness. Master Dōeki says: not understanding desire-nature becomes the wind of six objects, moving the water of deluded consciousness to form karma of the six paths. Difficult to exhaust numerically, accumulating to form one realm is called the desire-ālaya. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: the desire realm completely gives rise to six consciousnesses, gives rise to immeasurable desires, generating karma. That karma becomes ālaya, containing and gathering

[Page 25, Upper]
fruits. Or that karma becomes karmic fruit, because it is generated by afflictions. Regarding "three-realm emptiness" etc., both masters say: third clarifies affliction emptiness. Master Dōeki says: "three-realm emptiness" refers back to the previous karma emptiness. Fundamental ignorance means ignorance is the root of all delusions. It can also be said that all afflictions are generally accumulated in one ignorance as ālaya. Master Wŏnch'ŭk has two explanations: first, "three-realm emptiness" concludes the above two sections on karma and fruit. "Three-realm fundamental ignorance" means the view and cultivation afflictions of the three realms are called ignorance in terms of their foundation. I say: the three emptinesses of fruit etc. are not clear in the sūtra text, but the two masters well understand the meaning. This accords with the new version.

Sūtra: Three grounds, nine births cease; within the previous three realms, remaining ignorance habitual karmic retribution is empty. The vajra bodhisattva attains the samādhi of principle-exhaustion, therefore delusion-fruit birth-cessation is empty, existence-fruit is empty, because causes are empty, sarvajña is also empty, cessation-fruit is empty, delusions were already empty before.

The new version says: "In the holy stages of various grounds, conditioned arising and ceasing within the three realms, remaining ignorance habits and transformational karmic retribution are all also empty. The near-enlightenment bodhisattva attains vajra concentration; the causes and fruits of two deaths are empty. All-knowledge is also empty." Citing the text according to Liangbian's meaning. Regarding "three grounds, nine births cease" etc., the first fascicle says: "namely the seventh, eighth, and ninth [grounds]; each ground has three births, combined as nine births. This one character 'cease' some say belongs to the preceding, but the present meaning has it belong to the following. Using this contemplation makes ignorance and accumulated causes and fruits all empty, therefore able to extinguish these empty dharmas. Saying 'remaining ignorance accumulation of the previous three realms' can have two explanations: first, this sūtra does not yet clarify transformational birth-and-death, therefore does not separately explain the ground of ignorance-dwelling, generally treating it as remaining habits of the three realms." I say: investigating the new and old sūtras, this

[Page 25, Lower]
explanation seems useless. Since the following text already explains Buddha-fruit as permanent dwelling, there should also be transformational birth-and-death and grounds of ignorance-dwelling. It's just that three-realm ordinary people are originally completely bound; now having cut off the four dwellings, this ignorance remains, therefore "remaining." To speak completely, one should say "extinguishing ignorance-accumulation emptiness and also extinguishing karmic-retribution emptiness." Because of those empty dharmas, they can be extinguished. If not empty dharmas, then they could not be extinguished. I assist in clarifying this master's meaning: the Teaching Transformation chapter explains the ten grounds - the first three grounds as one category, explaining cutting off three-realm form afflictions; the next three grounds as one category, explaining cutting off three-realm mind afflictions; the next three grounds as one category, explaining cutting off three-realm mind-form habitual afflictions. Also, the Upholding chapter explains the sixth ground: "exhausting all afflictions of three-realm accumulated causes, fruits, and karma." Therefore we know: three-realm primary [afflictions] are already exhausted by the sixth ground; from the seventh ground onward, only habitual tendencies are cut off. We thus know the text "three grounds, nine births" explains from the seventh ground onward. However, distinctions should be made: the seventh ground is still fragmentary [birth-death]; from the eighth ground onward is transformational birth. Master Jizang says: "three-realm fundamental" etc. clarifies transformational cause emptiness; "three grounds, nine births" etc. clarifies transformational fruit emptiness. The explanation has two meanings: first, the eighth, ninth, and tenth grounds all have three minds, combined as nine births and ceasings. The second meaning is that within the transformational three realms, each has three types of mental birth-bodies, called "three grounds, nine births and ceasings." From first through fifth grounds are called "samādhi-bliss practice mental birth-body." The seventh and sixth grounds are called "awakening-to-dharma self-nature mental birth-body." From the eighth ground onward are called "category co-arising effortless practice mental birth-body." The Tripiṭaka master says: first, the seeing ground is in the first ground; second, the cultivation ground is from the second ground onward; third, the ultimate ground is in the tenth ground. Within these three grounds, each has initial birth, subsequent dwelling, and final fulfillment, making nine births and ceasings. Saying "remaining ignorance habits within the previous three realms"

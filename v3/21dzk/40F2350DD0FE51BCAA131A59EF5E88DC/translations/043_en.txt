severs formless realm conceptual [afflictions]. Dwelling in the thin is called "thin afflictions." Master Ye says: Sakṛdāgāmin means "thin" - that is, ignorance is thin. Just as the Hīnayāna calls removing six categories of desire thoughts "thin."

Scripture: "Furthermore, constantly manifest" up to "buddha lands"
Master Ce says: The ninth first indicates the name, next explains contemplation, finally time periods. Regarding middle path contemplation, Master Ce says: Entering signless contemplation, separating from existence/non-existence, eternalism/nihilism, etc. Or making twelve-link dependent origination contemplation to separate from eternalism and nihilism. Regarding "exhausting the collective causes and karma of the three realms, etc.," Master Ce says: Collective causes generally indicate the afflictions and karma of the three realms, called the truth of origination. Collective karma specifically explains various karmas like sins, etc. All afflictions specifically explains root and secondary afflictions, etc. Or collective causes are karma-generating afflictions. All afflictions are karma-nourishing afflictions. Master Ye says: Collective causes are the collective karma of ignorant afflicted grounds - karma that drags into birth. All afflictions arise falsely through confusion about phenomena. One volume says: This ground has reached the ultimate regarding the three realms, therefore it generally raises and concludes the collection. Regarding "contemplating neither existence nor non-existence, etc.," Master Zang says: The middle path becomes manifest. If following the new text, it contemplates the principle of twelve-link causation being neither existent nor non-existent, one-mark signless. Regarding anāgāmin, Master Ce says: Although this ground severs all afflictions of the three realms, subtle ones still manifest. Therefore the *Saṃdhinirmocana* and others say: Bodhisattvas from the seventh ground still generate the affliction of greed in the three realms. Therefore here anāgāmin is established. Anāgāmin is translated as "non-returner." Based on reality, sixth ground bodhisattvas are also born in the desire realm, as in the *Prajñāpāramitopadeśa*. Now making correspondence through one aspect, therefore called "non-returner." Master Zang says: Never again returning to the desire realm. Master Ye says: The Two Vehicles do not return to the desire realm, therefore called "non-returner." Now

bodhisattvas enter the seventh ground's no-birth patience. Never again regressing to the arising-ceasing afflictions of lower grounds.

Scripture: "Furthermore, the bodhisattva Profound Penetration cultivates no-birth dharma-bliss patience for ten asaṃkhyeya kalpas" up to "bestowing transformative dharma treasuries"
Master Ce says: The tenth. First indicating the name, next time periods, next explaining contemplation. Profound means distant and far. Penetration means understanding. Reaching far to the edge of effortful practice is called "profound." First entering no-birth patience is called "penetration." Regarding "cultivating no-birth dharma-bliss patience for ten asaṃkhyeya kalpas," among the five patience [levels], no-birth patience has three grades - this is the lower grade. Master Zang says: The seventh ground attains no-birth and first realizes dharma fitting the spirit, therefore called "dharma-bliss patience." Like the first ground being called "joy." Regarding "extinguishing the collective causes, karma, and fruits of the three realms," Master Ce says: In this stage, the subtle habituations of karma and fruits in the three realms are extinguished. Master Ye says: Previously only causes were extinguished; here both causes and effects are exhausted. Master Zang says: The previous six grounds exhaust causes; the seventh ground extinguishes effects. It can also be that six grounds sever primary [afflictions] and seven grounds sever habituations. Regarding "final body," Masters Ce and Ye say: The final portion of conditioned [existence]. Master Zang says: The end of conditioned [existence] is called "final body." According to the *Prajñāpāramitopadeśa*, due to past life conditions, seventh ground bodhisattvas have physical bodies. The seventh ground is the śrāvaka ground. Śrāvakas achieve awakening with physical bodies. Borrowing the characteristics to understand the meaning, therefore it says the seventh ground has physical bodies. The *Prajñāpāramitopadeśa* says: The first ground is called dharma-body, and the seventh ground being physical body - this is the transformational dharma-body. This is one-sided explanation that should not be definitively grasped. Therefore the *Avataṃsaka* says: At first arousing bodhicitta one immediately achieves perfect awakening - how could the seventh ground still be physical body? Regarding "no-birth knowledge and exhaustion knowledge," Master Zang says: The exhaustion of conditioned causes is called exhaustion knowledge. Results not arising is called no-birth knowledge. Master Ye says: Awakening to dharma

【Page 85 Upper】
no-birth is called no-birth knowledge. False afflictions permanently quiescent is called exhaustion knowledge. Regarding "tenth ground," all masters say: The tenth dharma master among thirteen dharma masters. Regarding "Brahmā heaven," Master Zang says: The Brahmā heaven king of the first dhyāna. Master Ce says: Brahmā means pure - having already dwelled in the pure practice stage.

Scripture: "Furthermore, equal awakening" up to "seeing buddha samādhi"
The new translation says: Furthermore, the bodhisattva mahāsattva of the Immovable Ground dwells in no-birth patience with body neither increasing nor decreasing, severing all effortful practices. Mind after mind in tranquility. Master Ce says: The eleventh first indicates the name, next explains contemplation, finally time periods. The eighth ground simultaneously contemplating both conventional and ultimate truth is called "equal awakening." Regarding "dwelling in no-birth patience contemplating mind after mind in tranquility," Master Ye says: This explains contemplative mind. That is, dwelling in medium-grade no-birth patience contemplating mind tranquility. Uninterrupted true mind is called "mind after mind." Master Ce says: "Every thought completely empty" - this reveals the meaning of constant tranquility. Regarding "signless marks, etc.," Master Ce says: This reveals the meaning of constant function. Regarding "yet using mind riding upon the multitudes' directions, etc.," Master Ce says: Function yet constantly tranquil. Master Zang says: Riding upon sentient beings' directions - riding can transport sentient beings. Direction means emotions having tendencies called "direction." Therefore the *Xici* says: Directions gather by categories. Responding transformationally without direction, following wherever beings are located. Therefore called "directions of the multitudes." One volume says: This is skillful means wisdom that in one thought-moment can receive opportunities and respond everywhere to all directions. Regarding "knowing this place, etc.," Master Ce says: Learning the contemplation of ten powers, raising the first and last two to reveal the middle eight. Regarding mahārāja, Master Ce says: If following the Original Record,

【Page 85 Lower】
it translates as "great sage" - the great general of buddhadharma. Or called the stage of no-effort. Or translated as "great power." Or translated as "dragon-elephant." Master Zang says: This translates as "great minister." Like the sutra calling Śāriputra "great general of buddhadharma." Master Ye says: This means "great dragon-elephant." Also called "great dharma general."

Scripture: "Furthermore, wisdom light" up to "buddha flower samādhi"
Master Ce says: The twelfth. Indicating name, explaining contemplation, time periods. Using the four unobstructed knowledges to transform sentient beings, or generating the six supernatural powers is called "wisdom light spiritual transformations." Regarding "extinguishing mind and mind-marks," Master Ce says: Extinguishing the self-nature of body and mind is called extinguishing mind. If extinguishing the distinctions upon mind is called extinguishing mind-marks. Master Ye says: True characteristic true mind is like a bright mirror. Because it responds externally, it illuminates continuously without mind. Regarding "dharma eye seeing, etc.," Master Zang says: The dharma eye illuminating existence is knowledge of conventional truth. Because it can only condition existence to liberate sentient beings, it is called "dharma eye seeing all dharmas." This is only one-sided explanation that should not be definitively grasped. The flesh and divine eyes see coarse and subtle forms. The wisdom eye sees emptiness. Because three eyes are used together, it is called "three eyes seeing form and emptiness." One volume says: Because the buddha eye is not yet attained, the four eyes are clarified. Regarding "bhagavat stage," Master Zang says: This translates as "world-honored." Also called "ground of breaking purity." Bhaga means "breaking," vat means "pure ground." Master Ce says: This means "world-honored" because it possesses all virtues. The ninth ground is also called "world-honored." Regarding "buddha flower samādhi," Master Ce says: Because it resembles buddha concentration, it is called "buddha flower." Master Zang says: This is śūraṃgama samādhi. Master Ye says: Because it can generate great results, it is called "buddha flower samādhi."

what thing" when saying "up to form"? Answer: "Up to" mostly abbreviates intermediate words. However, it may not always seem necessary. For example, when the Brahmajāla Sūtra explains the third precept: "Engaging in sexual misconduct oneself and teaching others sexual misconduct, up to not engaging in deliberate sexual misconduct with all women" - there is no separate indication of people above and below, so what people are abbreviated in between? When explaining the ninth precept: "Among all sentient beings, up to among non-sentient beings, insulting with harsh speech," saying "beings and non-beings" - what else is abbreviated in between? There are such examples. Scholars should consider accordingly.

Sūtra: Because prajñāpāramitā is empty, it does not see conditions, does not see truths, up to all dharmas empty, inner emptiness, outer emptiness, inner-outer emptiness, conditioned emptiness, unconditioned emptiness, beginningless emptiness, nature emptiness, ultimate emptiness, prajñāpāramitā emptiness, cause emptiness, Buddha-fruit emptiness, empty because of emptiness of emptiness. Only because of dharma-aggregation there is existence, because of sensation-aggregation there is existence, because of name-aggregation there is existence, because of cause-aggregation there is existence, because of fruit-aggregation there is existence, because of ten practices there is existence, because of Buddha-fruit there is existence, up to the six paths - all exist.

The new version says: "Through profound prajñāpāramitā, illuminating and seeing that all dharmas are completely empty. Inner emptiness, outer emptiness, inner-outer emptiness, emptiness of emptiness, great emptiness, ultimate emptiness, conditioned emptiness, unconditioned emptiness, beginningless emptiness, complete emptiness, scattered emptiness, natural emptiness, characteristic emptiness, emptiness of all dharmas, prajñāpāramitā emptiness, cause emptiness, Buddha-fruit emptiness, empty because of emptiness of emptiness. All conditioned dharmas exist because of dharma-aggregation, exist because of sensation-aggregation, exist because of name-aggregation, exist because of cause-aggregation, exist because of fruit-aggregation, exist because of six destinies, exist because of ten grounds, exist because of Buddha-fruit - all exist." Master Dōeki says: jointly discriminating objects and wisdom. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: discriminating how contemplating wisdom illuminates emptiness and

[Page 22, Lower]
existence. The first fascicle says: "Although all dharmas are empty, observation is necessary to see them. Therefore wisdom is raised to verify emptiness. Briefly clarifying the twelve emptinesses." I say: investigating the sūtra's meaning, what is called emptiness mostly resembles the Middle Way principle. In the Prajñāpāramitā Treatise's explanation of the eighteen emptinesses, it says: "Practicing emptiness to break existence, mostly not clinging to emptiness. Separating from these two extremes, practicing these eighteen emptinesses with the Middle Way." Regarding cause-emptiness, Master Jizang says "from the vajra stage onward." Regarding ten practices, the first fascicle calls it "ten-ground practices." I say: this accords with the new version.

Sūtra: Good son, if a bodhisattva sees dharmas, sentient beings, self, persons, and knowledge-views, this person's practice in the world is no different from the world. Regarding all dharmas, unmoved, not arriving, not ceasing, without characteristics, without non-characteristics - all dharmas are likewise thus. All Buddhas, Dharma, and Sangha are likewise thus. This is precisely the first ground - one thought-moment completely possesses eighty-four thousand prajñāpāramitās.

Master Dōeki says: the fourth discriminates correct from incorrect. From "regarding all dharmas, unmoved" to "pāramitās." The new version says: "If regarding all dharmas one attains unmoved, unborn, unceasing, without characteristics, without non-characteristics, one should not give rise to views. Why? All dharmas are thus. All Buddhas, Dharma, and Sangha are likewise thus. When holy wisdom is present, the very first thought-moment completely possesses eighty-four thousand pāramitās. This is called the Ground of Joy." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: clarifying correct contemplation. That is, from the ten faiths onward up to the ten dedications, all perform this contemplation. Among all dharmas, one-flavored equality, without characteristics of movement and change. Because there is no movement and change, there is no arriving. "Arriving" means arising. Because of no movement, there is no arising. Because of no arising, there is no ceasing. Master Dōeki says: because it is not deviant, there is no arriving. Regarding "one thought-moment," Master Jizang says: first-ground bodhisattvas take true suchness as mind - how could there be one thought-moment? Now borrowing one thought-moment of lower grounds to illustrate the accumulated cultivation of upper

[Page 23, Upper]
grounds. I say: this should be decided.

Sūtra: What can immediately carry is called Mahāyāna. When immediately extinguished, it becomes vajra, also called concentration, also called all practices. As explained in the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā.

The new version says: "When obstructions are exhausted and liberation carries, it is called vehicle. When movement-characteristics are extinguished, it is called vajra-concentration. When essence-characteristics are equal, it is called all-knowledge wisdom." These are different names. Master Dōeki says: universally carrying all practices, carrying oneself and carrying others, hence called Mahāyāna. Breaking delusions and exhausting sources, also called vajra. Mind-moments of cessation, also called concentration. Perfectly fulfilling all virtues is called true practice. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: Mahāyāna means "great vehicle practice." This encompasses the previous ten grounds' meaning. "Immediately extinguished becomes vajra, also called concentration" praises the near-enlightenment stage. The final thought-moment of the tenth ground can break the two obstructions like vajra breaking objects. "Also called all practices" praises perfect enlightenment. Because one practice contains all practices, it is called "all practices." Dividing the new text: "obstructions exhausted" etc. encompasses the ten grounds. "Movement-characteristics" etc. clarifies the near-enlightenment ground. "Essence-characteristics" etc. clarifies the Tathāgata ground. I say: using this text to correspond to various stages, the masters can well understand the text's meaning. The first fascicle says: "This clarifies the first ground; from 'Great King, bodhisattvas' onward clarifies the remaining nine grounds and Buddha-fruit." This meaning is not yet complete.

Sūtra: Great King, the names, meanings, and sentences of this sūtra are the names, meanings, and sentences spoken by hundreds of Buddhas, thousands of Buddhas, hundreds of thousands of myriads of Buddhas. Filling the Ganges-sand number of three-thousand great-thousand worlds with immeasurable seven treasures and giving them to sentient beings in three-thousand great-thousand worlds, causing them all to attain the seven sages and four fruits, does not compare to generating one thought of faith in this sūtra - how much more one who understands one sentence! Sentences are non-sentences, because of non-non-sentences; prajñā is non-sentences, sentences are non-prajñā, also non-bodhisattva

[Page 23, Lower]
Why? Because the ten grounds and thirty births are empty, beginning-birth, dwelling-birth, and ending-birth are unattainable. Because the three births in each ground are empty, it is also not sarvajña, not Mahāyāna, because of emptiness.

The new version says: "Great King, the written words and sentences of this prajñāpāramitā are what hundreds of Buddhas, thousands of Buddhas, hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of all Buddhas jointly explain together. Textual prajñā." Master Dōeki says: first is shared explanation, second is comparative measurement, third is interpretation. Also: names designate inherent nature, sentences designate distinctions, texts reveal meaning-flavors. This is established from what is revealed. From "how much more understanding" to "non-prajñā." The new version says: "How much more those who can uphold, recite, and understand one sentence! Why? Because the nature of written words is separate, without written word characteristics, neither dharma nor non-dharma." Master Dōeki says: "sentences are non-" etc. means the nature of written words is not existent, therefore not sentences; not non-existent, therefore not non-sentences. Since sentence-dharmas are thus, names and meanings are interpreted accordingly. I say: "sentences are non-" etc. reveals the emptiness of written words. "Prajñā is non-sentences" etc. immediately reveals the emptiness of textual prajñā. Think carefully about this. The masters' interpretative texts cannot be extensively presented. Regarding "prajñā is also non-bodhisattva" etc., the new version says: "Because prajñā is empty, bodhisattvas are also empty." Master Dōeki says: "prajñā is also non-bodhisattva" means awakening to emptiness of persons is called prajñā. Because both persons and dharmas are empty, it says "non-." Regarding "non-sarvajña" etc., Master Dōeki says: since causes are not practices, fruits also have no attainment. Since Buddha-fruit is empty, vehicles are also empty. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: not only non-bodhisattva, but also non-sarvajña essence. Not only essence-emptiness, but Mahāyāna practice and function are also empty. The first fascicle says: "thirty births emptiness" etc. clarifies emptiness of persons; "non-sarvajña" etc. is emptiness of cause-and-effect dharmas. I say: sarvajña is fruit, Mahāyāna is cause. However, the sūtra text from here upward to "prajñā is also non-" - the intended meaning is unclear. Scholars should study this.

This is the principle of no-self. The first two lines clarify that mind-consciousness has no self and provisionally depends on the four elements. The next two lines clarify that the mind-consciousness mistakenly conceives the four elements as belonging to the self. The next line clarifies that the physical body has no self. The next line clarifies that the physical body is not the dwelling place of the self. Later there are two lines that raise the previous no-self to compare it with the no-self of kingdoms. Another interpretation: initially there is one and a half verses clarifying that the body has no self. The two lines below take up the absence of body to explain the absence of kingdom and land.

Master Zang says: "Having no eyes, nurturing and protection become a pleasure vehicle" means nurturing the four elements and claiming there is a self. Not knowing that this body exists through provisional combination, resembling how many pieces of wood form a cart. Erroneously calculating lightness and suffering, calling it a pleasure vehicle. "Form" refers to the four elements. "Spirit" refers to consciousness-spirit. Master Ben says: Not understanding that the body is impermanent, suffering, empty, no-self, and belonging to no-self, one erroneously generates love and attachment. All fears arise. If one hears the Dharma and awakens to emptiness, what more is there to fear?

Scripture: "At that time the Dharma teacher" up to "patient acceptance of the unborn"
Master Ce says: The second is hearing the Dharma and obtaining benefit.

Scripture: "At that time the Dharma teacher" up to "samādhi equal to space"
"Dharma-eye emptiness" - Master Ce says this is person-emptiness. Master Ye says awakening to self-emptiness. Seeing the true Dharma of patient acceptance of suffering. "Samādhi equal to space" - Master Ce says this is dharma-emptiness. Master Ye says space samādhi and such. Master Ben says: If hearing the previous verses, one should attain the first fruit, because of the path of suffering truth such as impermanence. Or hearing the Dharma and realizing emptiness, immediately through the principle of dharma-emptiness one reaches the first stage.

Scripture: "Hearing the Dharma and awakening" up to "patient acceptance of the unborn dharma"

I say: The second is teaching and transforming the various kings. The text has six distinct parts. First, teaching and transforming the various kings. Second, Spotted Foot questions. Third, Pūrṇamaṇḍala answers. Fourth, Spotted Foot and the various kings obtain benefit. Fifth, Spotted Foot releases the various kings. Sixth, Spotted Foot leaves home and obtains benefit. Regarding Spotted Foot obtaining space samādhi:

The Tiantai Lotus Sutra Commentary, fascicle one, says: Spotted Foot heard the Dharma and attained the ground of space equality, which is immediately the first stage. The Record says: Saying "attaining space equality is immediately the first stage" - he already received that teaching. In the Small Vehicle it would be the first fruit, in the Great Vehicle it would be dry wisdom, presently on the stage of seeing, in the Distinct Teaching it would be joy, the same as the meaning of pure conduct in the Great Sutra. Regarding the various kings realizing the samādhi of the three emptiness gates - Master Ce says: emptiness, wishlessness, and signlessness. Master Ye's meaning agrees. Regarding Spotted Foot leaving home and attaining patient acceptance of the unborn - Master Ben says: This is the fourth patience among the five patiences.

Scripture: "As explained in the Ten Kings' Stages"
I say: This is Pūrṇamaṇḍala's second text, as before. Regarding present-world karmic retribution, I say: This is the Great King's second text, as before. Master Ce says: The explanation of the Ten Kings' Stages tells that five thousand kings constantly recited this sutra, obtaining dharma-joy in present retribution, and in life retribution being born in human and heavenly realms and departing from various calamities and difficulties. Master Ye says: In other sutras, because the various kings constantly recite, they presently receive retribution.

Scripture: "Great King, sixteen" up to "names, flavors, and phrases"
Master Ce says: The third concludes by showing and encouraging acceptance and maintenance.

【Page 75 Upper】
Scripture: "At that time Śākyamuni" up to "end of chapter"
Master Ce says: The third major section is the assembly obtaining benefit.

Regarding the first stage, Master Ye says: the first stage of joy. Master Zang follows the text. Regarding the treasury of essential emptiness, Master Ye says: the patient acceptance of the unborn and patient acceptance of unborn dharma-joy of the fourth stage and above. Master Zang says seventh stage and above. Master Ye says: patient acceptance of the unborn; the seventh stage is patient acceptance of dharma-joy, or higher stages. From the first to tenth stages, all masters follow the text. Regarding ten samādhis, Master Zang says: the ten totalities. Master Ce agrees. Or the signless samādhi extinguishes ten characteristics. Regarding two samādhis, Master Zang says: eight masteries and eight liberations. Master Ce says: samādhi of the two truths, or emptiness and wishlessness. Regarding intrinsic faith, Master Ce says: gaining faith in Buddha-nature. Master Ye says: ten faiths. Master Zang says: four indestructible faiths and immeasurable empty faith. Master Ce says: faith in dharma-emptiness. Master Ye says: ten abodes and above. I say: The explanations of the various masters cannot be quoted in full. Also difficult to believe partially. Readers should accept or reject accordingly. Also, at the end of the sutra it says "I now briefly explain" - who is speaking?

Benevolent Kings Sutra for Protection of the State, Prajñāpāramitā, Chapter Six: Scattering Flowers
Master Zang says: The six chapters of proper explanation are divided into four. The upper three chapters clarify the prajñā that can protect. The second chapter on protecting the state clarifies the protected kingdoms and lands, which is now complete. This present chapter is the third, showing the ritual of material offerings. The sixteen kings heard the above explanation of prajñā and obtained numerous benefits. With inner joy they scattered flowers in offering. Thus this became the title.

【Page 75 Lower】
Therefore it is called the "Scattering Flowers Chapter." Though offerings are numerous, they do not exceed three types. First, respectful offerings, namely incense, flowers, etc. Second, material offerings, namely clothing, etc. Third, cultivation offerings, namely the six perfections, four means of attraction, etc. This chapter mainly clarifies respectful offerings and cultivation offerings. Master Ye says: This chapter realizes faith. Those with faith scatter flowers to express offerings. Those without faith generally thereby realize faith. Taking the name from the beginning, it is called "scattering flowers."

Scripture: "At that time the sixteen" up to "end of chapter"
Master Zang says: The text of this chapter has six sections. First, clarifying that the sixteen kings heard the Dharma with joy and scattered flowers in offering. From "at that time the various kings" below, second, making vows. From "the Buddha told the great king" below, third, the Tathāgata's confirmation. From "at that time the Buddha" below, fourth, manifesting spiritual power. From "the Buddha manifested supernatural powers" below, fifth, the assembly obtaining benefit. From "listen carefully, listen carefully" below, sixth, conclusion. Master Ce says it becomes three. First, the various kings scatter flowers to make offerings to the World-Honored One. Next, the Buddha manifests spiritual transformations causing the assembly to obtain benefit. Finally, praising prajñā and encouraging the assembly to accept and maintain it.

Scripture: "At that time the sixteen" up to "like clouds descending, immediately scattering one million" up to "covering the great assembly above"
I say: The old version says "golden ra flowers." The new version says "golden lotus flowers." What about the character "ra"? "Again scattering eighty thousand" up to "and all the great assembly." "Again scattering wonderful awakening" up to "like clouds descending."

"Thus observing and transforming to benefit sentient beings." All masters alike call this a brief answer. Master Soku says: "Regarding this 'like illusion,' there are naturally two explanations. First: both that which transforms and that which is transformed are all dependent [on conditions] and not real. Therefore they are explained as 'like illusion.' All dharmas born from causes and conditions are empty. Therefore they are explained as 'like illusion.' As in the answer text under 'all prajñās' below, all should be explained according to this interpretation."

Sūtra: "Sentient beings' consciousness initially... to... such as this"

Master Soku says: "In the second extensive [explanation] there are two parts: first clarifying that the transformed are like illusion, then from 'Great King, if bodhisattvas' down, clarifying that those who transform are like illusion."

Sūtra: "Sentient beings' consciousness... to... illusory truth sentient beings"

Master Soku says: "Regarding the text on the transformed, there are separately two parts: first explanation, then from 'all phantom transformations' down, generally concluding 'like illusion.' Also explaining the seven kinds of provisional [existence], dividing into seven. The seven provisionals are: first, dharma-provisional; second, experience-provisional; third, name-provisional; fourth, continuity-provisional; fifth, relative-provisional; sixth, condition-formed provisional; seventh, cause-produced provisional." Master Bun agrees. Master Eki says: "The extensive answer text has six parts: first, dharma-provisional; second, experience-provisional; third, name-provisional; fourth, continuity-provisional; fifth, relative-provisional; sixth, cause-formed provisional."

Sūtra: "Sentient beings' consciousness... to... real consciousness dharmas"

The new version says: "However, all sentient beings in distant kalpas—the initial moment of consciousness differs from wood and stone. Being born with defilement and purity, each is able to become the root of immeasurable countless defiled and pure consciousnesses. From the initial moment through unspeakable kalpas up to the vajra's final moment, there are unspeakable unspeakable consciousnesses. They generate what is explained as sentient beings'

two dharmas of form and mind. Form is called the form aggregate, mind is called the four aggregates. All have the nature of accumulation, concealing the true reality. It also says: 'Firmness and support are called earth, moisture is called water, warm nature is called fire, lightness and movement are called wind. What generates the five consciousness-places is called the five form-faculties. Thus through successive transformation, one form and one mind generate unspeakable immeasurable forms and minds, all being like illusion.'" Master Soku says: "In the first clarification of dharma-provisional, the text has separately two parts: first correctly clarifying dharma-provisional, then from 'Great King, ordinary people' down, [explaining] the superior-inferior differences in how ordinary and sage beings grasp objects." Master Eki says: "First clarifying dharma-consciousness, second clarifying the arising good and evil, third from 'form' down correctly clarifying provisional [existence]." Regarding sentient beings' consciousness, Master Eki says: "Generally marking all consciousnesses. This has two explanations. First, Master Paramārtha generally establishes nine consciousnesses. First, the amala consciousness, having true-suchness original enlightenment as its nature. When entangled it's called tathāgatagarbha; when liberated it's called dharmakāya. Amala consciousness means 'stainless consciousness.' The remaining eight consciousnesses are largely the same as [taught by] various masters. Second, Master Cien establishes only eight consciousnesses. Amala is the pure aspect of the eighth consciousness." From the initial moment of consciousness to good consciousness, Master Soku says: "That the initial moment of consciousness differs from wood and stone means: wherever one is born, the initial moment of consciousness at the moment of receiving birth is correctly called 'birth-receiving consciousness.' This is only the nature-discrimination of retribution, differing from wood and stone, without strong discrimination. 'Inborn good and evil, etc.' clarifies good and evil seed-consciousnesses. If fully discriminated, it includes three perfumings: first, name-word perfuming; second, existential-link perfuming; third, self-view perfuming." Master Eki's meaning says: "The initial moment of consciousness clarifies retribution-consciousness. Sentient beings' past ignorance attracting present five fruits is called retribution-consciousness. The body differs from wood and stone. 'Inborn good, etc.' clarifies newly arising good and evil consciousnesses. Meeting good conditions generates good; meeting evil conditions generates evil. Previous moments of evil consciousness become causes for subsequent moments of evil consciousness. Good is likewise. This is same-type causation" (The above two masters explain the consciousness of the original limit of birth and death through the minds of initial birth in various destinies.

Examining the text and principle now, this explanation is not yet acceptable). Master Soku presents his own explanation and also presents another interpretation, saying: "If following the original record, 'inborn good and evil' means that due to having tathāgatagarbha, there is a mind that avoids suffering and seeks pleasure. This mind exists from original nature, not depending on external conditions, therefore called 'inborn.' Going against principle becomes delusion; being deluded, one also generates evil. Not depending on others either." Master Zō says: "Initial moment consciousness, inborn good, inborn evil. Evil becomes the root of immeasurable evil extending to hell; good becomes the root of immeasurable good extending to vajra bodhisattvas." Interpreters differ. Unable to present all completely. Now following the sūtra for explanation. The Nirvana Sūtra says: "Like the medicine of Snow Mountain—thus being one taste, according to where it flows there are various tastes. The medicine's true taste remains on the mountain, like the full moon." Combining the analogy: "One taste analogizes Buddha-nature. Due to afflictions, it produces various tastes—namely hell, animals, etc." I say now: one taste is precisely the unattainable, non-dual true nature. Again saying: "Thus one taste, according to where it flows having various different tastes" means: depending on unattainable true nature, arising attainable false thoughts, becoming ignorance and afflictions, creating karma and forming six-realm retributions. Also the Mahāprajñāpāramitā says: "All dharmas have no existence—thus they exist. Thus existing is like having no existence. Not knowing this matter is called ignorance." True-characteristics and the ground of ignorance originally have no before-and-after. But sentient beings within non-existence横generate recollective conceptual discrimination, long flowing in evil realms. Returning from delusion to gain understanding, knowing that afflictions are originally nirvana—what beginning or end is there? Therefore this sūtra says "initial moment consciousness arises." Original consciousness understands nature, therefore differing from wood and stone. The text saying "inborn good, inborn

evil" means: conditioning good sense-realms and arising consciousness-good. This consciousness-good arises from the self-nature true-reality good correct-cause. Again conditioning good matters and arising this consciousness is therefore good. If conditioning evil realms and arising consciousness-evil, this consciousness-evil arises from ignorance-perfuming productive-causes. Again conditioning evil matters and arising this consciousness is therefore called evil. The one-fascicle says: "What is meant by 'consciousness initial one thought'—though this sūtra doesn't explain flow-coming, it clarifies the source-beginning of consciousness, which is precisely the meaning of flow-coming. 'Inborn good, inborn evil' means initially arising one thought differing from wood and stone. Know that nature mysteriously assists principle and is conveniently called principle-good." Also explaining: "Further, one thought of consciousness immediately has the nature of avoiding suffering and seeking pleasure, called principle. This very good becomes the Buddha's correct cause. 'Inborn evil' is precisely one thought of ignorance, neither attained through cultivation and practice. Therefore called 'inborn.' Through this ignorance one can generate various evils, therefore called 'the root of immeasurable evil consciousnesses.' Through this one thought knowing-nature, one can generate the understanding of knowledge-views and various merits, therefore called 'the root of immeasurable consciousnesses.'" Master Bun says: "Some explanations of initial consciousness are as stated in the Four-Fascicle Laṅkāvatāra, first [fascicle]. Consciousness has three kinds of characteristics: namely turning-characteristic, karma-characteristic, and true-characteristic. Speaking of 'true-characteristic,' Master Haidong says: 'Original enlightenment true-mind not relying on false conditions is called self-true-characteristic.' Karma and turning follow in order." Also the Awakening of Faith discusses karma, turning, and manifestation, largely the same as Laṅkāvatāra, with slight differences in names. Master Haidong's explanation says: "Speaking of 'karma-characteristic': fundamental ignorance arises from stillness, causing movement. Movement becomes karma-consciousness, being extremely subtle. Speaking of 'turning-characteristic': this is the able-to-see characteristic. Depending on the previous karma-characteristic, it turns to become able-to-condition. Though having able-to-condition, it doesn't yet manifest conditioned-object realms. Speaking of 'manifestation-characteristic': this is precisely sense-realm characteristics. Depending on the previous turning-characteristic, it can manifest realms. From the very first karma-consciousness down..."

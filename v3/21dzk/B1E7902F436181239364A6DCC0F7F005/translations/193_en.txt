The treatises uniformly designate [everything as] "consciousness-only." Also, because dharmas are subsumed under the lord of the unconditioned, it is said that "all is suchness." (This means subsuming characteristics into nature.) Because dharmas are subsumed under the lord of the conditioned, it is said that "all dharmas are consciousness-only." (This means subsuming objects into mind.) Because dharmas are subsumed under the lord of discrimination, it is said that "all is prajñā." (This means relying on wisdom and not on consciousness.) Or, in opposition to materialist heretics and Bhāviveka who establish the existence of objects, simply to distinguish from them, the exclusivity of consciousness is stated. (See *Consciousness-Only Chapter* and private notes, *Pivotal Essentials* Volume 1, *Lamp* Volume 2. Also see *Gratitude Sutra* Volume 7.)

**Fifteenth Section: The Four Wisdoms of the Two Vehicles**
1. The wisdom that "my births are exhausted." 2. The wisdom that "the holy life is established." 3. The wisdom that "what was to be done is accomplished." 4. The wisdom that "there is no more becoming."

Explanation: Within extinction-wisdom (*kṣaya-jñāna*), two wisdoms are established, namely the wisdom that "my births are exhausted." This is further divided into the wisdom that "the holy life is established." Within non-arising wisdom (*anutpāda-jñāna*), two wisdoms are established, namely the wisdom that "there is no more becoming." This is further divided into the wisdom that "what was to be done is accomplished." "My births are exhausted" means the saṃsāric birth-and-death caused by afflictions is exhausted. "The holy life is established" means the path for counteracting all afflictions of the three realms is called the accomplishment of holy life, therefore it is also called "established." "What was to be done is accomplished" means the afflictive obstructions have already been severed. "There is no more becoming" means within one's own vehicle, one permanently does not receive further becoming and birth.

However, only for those of determined nature in the two vehicles are the four wisdoms complete and perfect. For those of undetermined nature who attain arhat fruition, although the four wisdoms of their own vehicle are ultimate, they are not ultimate in regard to Mahāyāna. That is, because the transformational birth-and-death with cognitive obstructions not yet severed may still be received, it is not yet ultimate. Therefore the *Śrīmālā Sutra* explains that arhats and pratyekabuddhas

**Lower Section**
have remaining ground of ignorance (*avidyā-vāsabhūmi*). Because dharma is not exhausted, there is birth with remainder. Although holy life is accomplished, because affairs are not ultimate, there should be works to be done. Because they do not deliver others, there should be destinations to reach. Therefore they are far from the nirvana realm. *Consciousness-Only Commentary* Volume 9 final section states: "By exhausting saṃsāric birth-and-death, it is said that for arhats 'my births are exhausted.' Attaining remaining different realizations is called 'holy life established.' What ordinary persons, gods and humans, and the seven types of learners (the first three fruits and four approaches) cannot accomplish is called 'what was to be done is accomplished.' That the severed afflictions no longer receive further becoming is called 'no more becoming.' This does not mean exhausting all afflictions and births to say 'no more becoming,' because there is transformational birth of the ignorance ground." (See *Special Extracts* Volume 5, Treatise Section 10.)

**Sixteenth Section: The Four Heavy Burdens Analogy Explained in the Śrīmālā Sutra**
The sutra states: "Just as the great earth bears four heavy burdens..." 1. Great ocean (Mahāyāna). 2. Mountains (Pratyekabuddha). 3. Vegetation (Śrāvaka). 4. Sentient beings (Those without [fixed] nature). That is, those without [determined] nature, śrāvakas, and pratyekabuddhas - these four types of nature are matched with analogies in reverse order. (See *Comprehensive Explanation* Volume 1. There are three interpretations.) Also that sutra states: "Just as the great earth has four kinds of treasure repositories..." 1. Priceless (Mahāyāna). 2. Superior value (Pratyekabuddha). 3. Medium value (Śrāvaka). 4. Lower value (Human and divine vehicles, analogized with gold and silver).

**Seventeenth Section: The Nine Complete Knowledges**
There are two types: 1. Wisdom complete knowledge. 2. Severing complete knowledge.

Wisdom complete knowledge means uncontaminated wisdom knows pervasively throughout the four truths' objects, called complete knowledge. Severing complete knowledge means the various severances. Severing is analytical cessation (*pratisaṃkhyā-nirodha*). Because it is revealed through severing, analytical cessation is called severing. Severing

complete knowledge: because a causal name is established upon this fruit, complete knowledge is the cause and severing is called the fruit. There are nine severing complete knowledges:

1. Desire realm seeing suffering-origination severing complete knowledge. 2. Desire realm seeing cessation severing complete knowledge. 3. Desire realm seeing path severing complete knowledge. 4. Form and formless realm seeing suffering-origination severing complete knowledge. 5. Form and formless realm seeing cessation severing complete knowledge. 6. Form and formless realm seeing path severing complete knowledge. 7. Five lower fetters exhaustion severing complete knowledge. 8. Form attachment exhaustion severing complete knowledge. 9. All dharma fetters exhaustion severing complete knowledge.

The verse states: "Severing complete knowledge has nine. Desire realm's first two severances make one. Two each one, combined three. Upper realms' three likewise. Remaining five lower fetters. Form's all severances make three."

Question: Does each severing establish one complete knowledge? Answer: No. Question: How are they established? Answer in verse: (As above.) Explanation: The first line expresses number, the next three lines clarify the six complete knowledges of seeing truth, the last two lines clarify the three complete knowledges of cultivation path. "Desire realm's first two severances make one" means establishing one complete knowledge for severing the first suffering-origination two truths of the desire realm. This is the first one. "Two each one, combined three" means the two refer to the cessation-path two truths of the desire realm. Severing these establishes one complete knowledge each. These are the second and third. "Combined three" means combining the four truths of the desire realm into three complete knowledges. "Upper realms' three likewise" means the four truths of the upper two realms are combined into three complete knowledges, like the number for the desire realm, hence the equal number is called "likewise." These are the fourth, fifth, and sixth. "Remaining five lower fetters, form's all severances make three" means the remaining refers to the cultivation-severed dharmas of the three realms, establishing

**Lower Section**
three complete knowledges through severing. These are called "remaining" because they are the remainder after path-of-seeing severances. That is, exhausting desire realm cultivation delusions establishes one complete knowledge. This is the seventh. Now this seventh complete knowledge's essence, together with the previous six complete knowledges of seeing truth and the unconditioned obtained through the nine grades of desire realm cultivation severance, are collectively called the lower fetters exhaustion complete knowledge. "Form's all severances make three" means form refers to the form realm. Exhausting these cultivation path delusions establishes one complete knowledge. This is the eighth. "All severances" means exhausting formless realm cultivation path delusions establishes one. This is the ninth. This complete knowledge's essence collectively gathers the essences of the three realms' seeing-cultivation unconditioned. "Three" concludes the above-mentioned establishment of three complete knowledges for the three realms' cultivation path.

Question: Why in the upper two realms are cultivation severances established as separate complete knowledges for the two realms, while seeing severances for the two realms are established together? Answer: Because the antidotes for form and formless cultivation-severed delusions are not the same, complete knowledges are established separately. Seeing severance antidotes are the same, so complete knowledges are explained together. Regarding accomplishment of complete knowledges on the seeing-cultivation paths: the path of seeing has fifteen moments. The first five moments have no complete knowledge. Upon reaching the sixth collective dharma-wisdom mind and seventh collective analogical wisdom patience mind, only one complete knowledge is accomplished. Upon reaching the eighth collective analogical wisdom mind and ninth cessation dharma-wisdom patience, one complete knowledge is also accomplished, combining two types. Upon reaching the tenth cessation dharma-wisdom and eleventh cessation analogical wisdom patience, one complete knowledge is also accomplished, combining three types. Upon reaching the twelfth cessation analogical wisdom and thirteenth path dharma-wisdom patience, one complete knowledge is also accomplished, combining four types. Upon reaching the fourteenth path dharma-wisdom and fifteenth path analogical wisdom patience, one complete knowledge is also accomplished, combining five types. Upon reaching the cultivation path stage, from path analogical wisdom until not yet departed from contamination, one complete knowledge is also accomplished, combining to make six. When completely departed from desire contamination but form attachment not yet exhausted, one lower fetters

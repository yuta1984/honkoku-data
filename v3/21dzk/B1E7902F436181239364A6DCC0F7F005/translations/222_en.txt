"Also, why are pratyekabuddhas and tathāgatas not established in the form realm?" Answer: "This should be contemplated. It is easy to understand."

Practice distinctions have five types. Among them, understanding-conduct bodhisattvas refer to bodhisattvas in the understanding-conduct stage. From the initial aspiration-generating bodhisattvas' vows until not yet entering the Ground of Extreme Joy, because they have not yet attained true inner realization.

Superior-aspiration-conduct bodhisattvas refer to all bodhisattvas in the ten grounds. Because they have already realized inner realization of pure aspiration.

Characterized-conduct bodhisattvas refer to bodhisattvas dwelling in the combined six grounds from the Ground of Extreme Joy to the Ground of Manifest Presence. Because although these six grounds are not joyful, they are said to still have intermixture.

Characterless-conduct bodhisattvas refer to bodhisattvas dwelling in the Immovable, Good Wisdom, and Dharma Cloud Grounds. Because they have already been able to attain mature non-discriminating wisdom.

**Fourteenth: Clarifying the Four Types of Liberation-Conducive Factors**

First is reliance liberation-conducive factors; second is understanding liberation factors; third is loving liberation factors; fourth is approaching-realization liberation factors.

The explanation states: The first, from desire for good dharmas to all good roots for seeking liberation, are all called reliance liberation-conducive. The second refers to good roots that act together with understanding regarding those corresponding mental factors. This is called understanding-conduct liberation-conducive factors. Good roots that act together with good [joy] in continuous pure attention to objects are called loving liberation-conducive factors. The fourth refers to definitely generating good roots of discernment-conducive factors right here. This is called approaching-realization liberation factors. See the *Abhidharma Treatise*, fascicle twelve.

**Fifteenth: Clarifying the Six Types of Discernment-Conducive Factors**

First is compliant discernment-conducive factors; second is progressive discernment-conducive factors; third is penetrating discernment-conducive factors; fourth is further-turning discernment-conducive factors (also called further-birth discernment-conducive factors); fifth is one-life discernment-conducive factors; sixth is one-sitting discernment-conducive factors.

The explanation states: The initially arising inferior-grade good roots that take truth-objects are called compliant discernment-conducive factors. When these same good roots transform into middle-grade, they are called progressive discernment-conducive factors. Because compared to the previous inferior grade, they are increasingly superior. When these same good roots increase to superior grade, in this life one is definitely capable of penetrating truth-principle. This is called penetrating discernment-conducive factors. Those of indeterminate lineage in this same life who turn toward supreme enlightenment, and pratyekabuddhas who seek teacherless wisdom and naturally realize enlightenment, turn toward further births. This is called further-turning discernment-conducive factors. If one can definitely penetrate here, this is called one-life discernment-conducive factors. This definitely enables penetration in this life. This is called one-sitting discernment-conducive factors.

The previous three types of discernment-conducive factors are respectively in the warming, peak, and patience stages. If speaking of the Lesser Vehicle, they can respectively correspond to undetermined (lower patience stage), determined (middle patience stage), and this very (upper patience stage) birth-time. If speaking of the Great Vehicle, only when the middle patience stage is complete is it called "this very birth-time." If one is in the lower patience or incomplete middle patience stages, it extends over multiple births. See the *Lotus Meaning-Decisions* and *Abhidharma Treatise*, fascicle thirteen.

**Sixteenth: Clarifying the Establishment of Direct Realization—Briefly, There Are Ten Types**

First is dharma direct-realization; second is meaning direct-realization; third is true direct-realization; fourth is subsequent direct-realization; fifth is

jewel direct-realization; sixth is non-conduct direct-realization; seventh is complete direct-realization; eighth is śrāvaka direct-realization; ninth is pratyekabuddha direct-realization; tenth is bodhisattva direct-realization.

The explanation states: Dharma direct-realization means conducting oneself having already attained superior-grade pure faithful understanding in truth-supreme dharmas. Why? Because in truth-supreme sutras and so forth, through the superior conditional power of hearing others' words, one has already attained superior-grade truth-supreme understanding embraced by the most excellent liberation-conducive good roots. Because of this it is called dharma direct-realization (completion of the provisions stage).

Meaning direct-realization means that in truth-supreme dharmas, having already attained superior grade, one examines dharma-patience regarding truth-objects, dwelling in the discernment-conducive stage. Why? Because through the superior conditional power of appropriate attention in the dharmas explained above, regarding suffering and other truth-objects, one has already attained superior-grade truth-examining dharma-patience embraced by the most excellent discernment-conducive good roots. Because this patience is manifested by three types of appropriate attention, it again becomes three grades: namely superior-superior, middle-superior. Middle-superior warming is the warming stage of "this very birth-time." Superior-middle refers to the peak-patience stage. Superior-superior refers to the supreme mundane dharma stage.

True direct-realization means having already attained the noble path possessed by the sixteen-mind-moment stage. Subsequent direct-realization refers to all cultivation paths. After the path of seeing, all mundane and supramundane are called subsequent direct-realization.

Jewel direct-realization means achieving purity regarding the Buddha, realizing purity regarding the Dharma, and realizing purity regarding the Sangha. Buddha-disciples, having already attained certainty regarding the jewels, realize pure faith, namely that the Tathāgata is a truly perfect enlightened one.

Non-conduct direct-realization means having already realized and attained non-active discipline. Although dwelling in the learner stage, one says "I have now already exhausted hell, animals, hungry ghosts, and falling into evil destinies."

**Lower Section**

"Also, I cannot create karma that brings about evil destinies." Because one has already attained non-active discipline. Non-active discipline is discipline embraced by precepts beloved by the noble ones. It is precisely undefiled discipline. By attaining this, the maturation of hell and so forth that are counteracted definitely will not occur. Because the three evil destinies are permanently exhausted and do not occur, it is called direct-realization.

Complete direct-realization is as explained in the complete path. Namely, having already ceased all gross disturbances and attained complete liberation from all bonds.

Śrāvaka direct-realization refers to the previously explained seven types of direct-realization. Because they are realized through hearing others' words, they are called śrāvaka direct-realization.

Pratyekabuddha direct-realization means that the previous seven types of direct-realization are realized without depending on others' words, hence called pratyekabuddha direct-realization.

Bodhisattva direct-realization means that bodhisattvas do not make realization among the previous seven types of direct-realization. Because they attain skill in the methods of taming śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, out of compassion for sentient beings, they do not depart through the lesser vehicle, and in the bodhisattva Ground of Extreme Joy, they enter the bodhisattva noble determination. This is called bodhisattva direct-realization.

Question: "What distinctions exist between śrāvaka direct-realization and bodhisattva direct-realization?"

Answer: "There are eleven types of distinctions: First is object-sphere distinction (because they take the extensive Great Vehicle as their object-sphere); second is sustaining distinction (because merit and wisdom provisions are perfected through three great incalculable eons); third is penetration distinction (because they penetrate the two deaths and self through supramundane wisdom); fourth is vow distinction (because they penetrate all sentient beings and their own body equally, vowing to embrace and benefit); fifth is liberation distinction (because they are liberated depending on the ten grounds); sixth is embracing distinction (because they are embraced by non-abiding nirvana); seventh is establishment distinction (because they skillfully cultivate and govern all buddhas' pure lands); eighth is retinue distinction (because they embrace all sentient beings as retinue); ninth is superior birth distinction (just as a child conceived in a worldly womb continues the father's lineage without letting it be severed, bodhisattvas continue and elevate the buddha-seed without letting it be severed—this is the characteristic of being true children of buddhas); tenth is birth distinction (because they are born in the Tathāgata's great assembly); eleventh is result distinction (because they sever the two obstructions and realize the wondrous result of the two transformations of the basis). Result distinctions have

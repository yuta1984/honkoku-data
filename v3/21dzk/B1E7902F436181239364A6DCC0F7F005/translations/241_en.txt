**Section 33: Clarifying the Six Domestic Animals**

Cattle, horses, dogs, sheep, pigs, and chickens.

*Brahmajāla-sūtra* Taiken's Old Traces, lower fascicle states: "Regarding the six domestic animals, the Zhou Records say: cattle, horses, dogs, sheep, pigs, and chickens are the six types. In principle, this actually extends to all domestic animals."

**Section 34: Clarifying the Measure of Yojana**

*Abhidharmakośa* fascicle 12 states: "Twenty-four fingers make one cubit. Four cubits make one bow-length. Five hundred krośa equal eight yojana." The explanation states: "One krośa is calculated as the distance from a village to an araṇya (meaning 'without clamor'). Eight krośa are said to equal one yojana." The interpretation is: calculating one cubit as one shaku eight sun, one bow-length is seven shaku two sun. Up to one krośa equals two li, and one yojana equals sixteen li. *Xiyuji* (Records of the Western Regions) fascicle 2 states: "Regarding numerical measurements, there is the yojana (formerly called youxun, also yushena, also youyan - these are corruptions). A yojana is the distance an ancient sage king's army would march in one day. Traditional transmission says one yojana is forty li. Indian custom makes it thirty li. Sacred teachings record only sixteen li. Dividing minutely, one yojana is divided into eight krośa. A krośa is the extreme distance a large bull's lowing can be heard."

(The following is as in the *Abhidharmakośa*: four cubits make one bow-length, etc.)

*Abhidharmakośa* fascicle 11 states: "Lake Anavatapta extends fifty yojana in length and width." *Records of the Western Regions* records

**Lower Section**

Lake Anavatapta as eight hundred li in length and width. Sixteen li equals one yojana (the *Kyōsuishō* fascicle 10 end agrees with the *Records of the Western Regions*). *Six-Fascicle Abstract* fascicle 1 end states (this is the *Four-Part Vinaya Abstract*): "*Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* distinguishes three types of yojana: large is eighty li, medium is sixty li, small is forty li." *Lotus Sound Training* quotes the *Abhidharmakośa Verses*: "One yojana is sixteen li and more."

**Section 35: Clarifying Śākyamuni's Ten Great Disciples**

Mahākāśyapa, foremost in ascetic practices; Śāriputra, foremost in wisdom;
Maudgalyāyana, foremost in supernatural powers; Pūrṇa, foremost in expounding Dharma;
Kātyāyana, foremost in debate; Subhūti, foremost in understanding emptiness;
Upāli, foremost in maintaining precepts; Aniruddha, foremost in divine eye;
Ānanda, foremost in learning; Rāhula, foremost in patience.

**Section 36: Clarifying the Six Fasting Days** (Appending the Three Annual Long Fasts)

*Brahmajāla-sūtra* Taiken's Commentary, lower fascicle states: "The six fasts are three each in the dark and bright fortnights: the 8th, 14th, and 15th days. On these days, demons and spirits gain power to harm people. To enable people to avoid harm, restrictions must be established."

**Three Annual Long Fasts**

*Tiwei-jing* states: "First month original fast on the 15th day, fifth month original fast on the 15th day, ninth month original fast on the 15th day."

**Section 37: Clarifying the Matter of the Later Five Hundred Years**

*Vajracchedikā Praise and Commentary*, upper fascicle states: "*Candragarbha-sūtra* explains: In the first five hundred years after Buddha's nirvana, liberation is firm - because most practitioners attain liberation and escape. In the second five hundred years, meditation is firm - because most practitioners attain meditation but not sainthood. In the third five hundred years, extensive learning is firm - because they extensively hear sūtras and treatises and are broadly learned with much knowledge. In the fourth five hundred years, merit is firm - because they create much merit building stupas and monasteries. In the fifth five hundred years, conflict purification is firm. Now saying 'later five hundred years' means that throughout the five periods, there are all those who maintain precepts and cultivate merit. In the later five hundred years, those who possess precepts, meditation, and wisdom can, within the teachings of formless cause and effect, give rise to pure mind, produce accordance wisdom, and make this the true characteristic."

*Genshin* fascicle 10 states (in the Medicine King chapter): "The later five hundred years: *Mahāsaṃnipāta-sūtra* says: After Buddha's nirvana, the first five hundred years have firm liberation... the fifth five hundred years have firm conflict purification. All use five hundred years as categories to record this. Therefore it says 'after nirvana, the later five hundred years.' True Dharma five hundred years, semblance Dharma one thousand years. After semblance Dharma, the initial five hundred years of the final Dharma period."

*Genshin* has two interpretations.

Various sūtras list the assembly of co-hearers as mostly 1,250 people, or the śrāvaka assembly as 12,000 people. Why is this said? Answer: The 1,250 people refers to when Buddha first attained enlightenment: in the first period he liberated five people including kulin; in the second period he liberated fifty people including Yaśas; in the third period he liberated

**Lower Section**

one hundred people including Śāriputra; in the fourth period he liberated one hundred people including Maudgalyāyana; in the fifth period he liberated five people including Uruvilvā-Kāśyapa; in the sixth period he liberated 295 people including Gayā-Kāśyapa; in the seventh period he liberated 200 people including Nadī-Kāśyapa. Thus there were 1,250 people in total. This refers to the constant retinue. *Contemplation of Amitāyus Commentary* states: "When the Tathāgata attained enlightenment, he first liberated Kāśyapa. Also the third person along with disciples numbered one thousand. Later arriving at Rājagṛha, he liberated the disciples of Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana, another 150. Therefore there were 1,250 monks. These constantly followed the Tathāgata, so various sūtras often mention them."

Tendai Genshin Sōzu's *Amitābha Sūtra Brief Record* states: "Sixth, clarifying the co-hearing assembly has three parts: first śrāvakas, second bodhisattvas, third mixed assembly... The second number is 1,250 people. That is: Uruvilvā's disciples 500, Gayā and Nadī each 250. Or it says: Gayā 300, Nadī 200. Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana's disciples 250. Also Yaśas' followers 50. These constantly follow the Holy Honored One as the faith-witnessing assembly."

**Section 38: Clarifying the Four Āgamas**

1. Saṃyukta-āgama, 2. Madhyama-āgama, 3. Dīrgha-āgama, 4. Ekottarika-āgama.

*Kyōsuishō* fascicle 5 states: "Regarding the old four āgamas: āgama is old Sanskrit. Newly called āgama. This means 'pure teaching' or 'transmitted teaching.' Because it flows forth from the truly pure dharma-realm, it's called 'pure teaching.' Because ancient buddhas transmitted it in succession, it's called 'transmitted teaching.' *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* fascicle 80

1. Paṇḍaka. This is the general name. Has the function of male organs but does not produce children.

2. Irṣyā-paṇḍaka. This is translated as "jealous." Becomes aroused upon seeing others engage in sexual activity, but not when not seeing it. Also has male organs but does not produce children.

3. Ṣaṇḍha (fanqie: chi-zhu) paṇḍaka. Originally has incomplete male organs. Also cannot produce children.

4. Pakṣa-paṇḍaka. Cannot function as male for half a month.

5. Ruṇa-paṇḍaka. "Ṇa" is translated as "cut." Refers to one who has been harmed.

An old commentary states: "Yellow Gate" (eunuch) is so named because their color is yellow, hence "yellow," and because it relates to male and female organs, hence "gate." The *Nirvāṇa-sūtra Phonetic Commentary* states: Taking those who have lost their organs, dressing them in yellow robes, and having them guard the royal gates, hence they are called "Yellow Gates."

*Vijñānavāda Treatise Separate Notes* fascicle 1 states: Question: What is the difference between ṣaṇḍha and paṇḍaka? Explanation: Fascicle 53 explains: There are briefly three types of paṇḍaka: 1) Complete, 2) Partial, 3) Damaged. If one is born without male organ development, this is called "complete paṇḍaka." If male sexual function arises for half a month, or others commit transgressions against oneself, or one sees others engage in non-celibate conduct and male urges arise, this is called "partial paṇḍaka." If harmed by swords etc., or damaged by illness, fire, spells etc., having previously had male organs but now being severed and broken so male function does not operate, this is called "damaged paṇḍaka." The first complete type is called both "paṇḍaka" and "ṣaṇḍha." The second partial type is only called "paṇḍaka," not "ṣaṇḍha." The third damaged type,

if not having transgressions committed against oneself by others, is only called "ṣaṇḍha," not "paṇḍaka." If having transgressions committed against oneself by others, it is called "paṇḍaka" and also "ṣaṇḍha."

*Xuanzan* fascicle 9 (in the chapter on peaceful practices) states: The five types of non-males are: congenital, castrated, jealous, half-monthly, and irrigated. Due to having one defect, male-female afflictions constantly accompany them, good people are hard to find, they are not proper vessels for the Dharma, hence should not be approached.

*Sheze* fascicle 4 end states: Regarding the commentary's "five types of non-males," *Abhidharma-samuccaya* fascicle 8 states: Like ṣaṇḍha and paṇḍaka, they are not suitable to serve and attend upon bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs. It also says: There are five types of paṇḍaka - congenital etc., same as this sūtra which has them keep distance.

Question: What are the Chinese meanings of ṣaṇḍha etc.? Answer: Ṣaṇḍha means "without organs." Even if there is organ form, if ultimately there is no male organ function, all are called "ṣaṇḍha." Paṇḍaka means "lustful desire" - enjoying others committing non-Dharma against oneself. Or it means "defiled" - because enjoying others committing transgressions against oneself can defile others, hence called "defiled."

Question: Among the five types, congenital and castrated permanently lack male function - they should be called "ṣaṇḍha," so why call them "paṇḍaka"? Answer: If lacking male function and not enjoying others committing transgressions against oneself, then called "ṣaṇḍha." Even lacking male function, if enjoying others committing transgressions against oneself, then called "paṇḍaka." According to reality, lacking male function should collectively be called "ṣaṇḍha." This sūtra and *Abhidharma-samuccaya* collectively call all five types "paṇḍaka" based on being restrained together with others. Hence *Yogācāra-bhūmi* states: For castrated etc., if not having transgressions committed against oneself, only ṣaṇḍha. If having transgressions committed against oneself by others, called "paṇḍaka." Among the five types,

seeing others engage in sexual conduct and having one's own male urges move is called "jealous." Having others engage in non-celibate conduct with oneself, obtaining others' semen and blood, and having one's own male urges arise is called "irrigated." Male urges moving only every half month gets the name "half-monthly." The other two are detailed. *Yogācāra-bhūmi* fascicle 53 explains three types - this expands on those without contradiction.

*Lotus Commentary* lower fascicle states: Five types of non-males. Cien states: 1) Congenital - born without complete male organs. 2) Castrated - losing male organs after birth. 3) Jealous - seeing others engage in sexual conduct causes male urges to move. 4) Half-monthly - male urges barely move every half month. 5) Irrigated - having others engage in non-celibate conduct with oneself, obtaining others' semen and blood, causing one's own male urges to arise. The five types in Sanskrit are called "paṇḍaka." In Chinese called "lustful desire" and also "defiled."

*Vimalakīrti Commentary* fascicle 5 (in the chapter on observing sentient beings) states: Paṇḍaka means "severed function" - the eunuch category. There are five types: congenital, castrated, jealous, half-monthly, irrigated types.

*Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra* fascicle 589 states: Like those lacking organs, called "paṇḍaka," they retreat from the bodhicitta and become false bodhisattvas.

*Yogācāra-bhūmi* fascicle 53 states: Question: Due to how many causes, although desiring to receive bhikṣu precepts, should one not be granted them? Answer: Bhikṣu precepts have briefly six causes: 1) Mental inclination damage, 2) Support damage, 3) Male form damage, 4) Pure dharma damage, 5) Being bound to others, 6) For obtaining others. If ṣaṇḍha and paṇḍaka, called "male form damage" - should not leave home and receive full ordination. Know the causes as already explained before. Also paṇḍaka briefly has three types.

*Vinaya in Four Parts Excerpt* (fascicle 5, Ordination Dependence Collection, chapter 8) excerpts: Five non-eunuchs. Five types in the vinaya: 1) Congenital eunuch, 2) Made by cutting, 3) Having jealous sexual arousal only when seeing others' sexual activity, 4) Suddenly transforming, 5) Half month capable as male, half month female and incapable as male. Many in the world cut themselves. According to the Four Parts [Vinaya] should be expelled.

Same excerpt commentary fascicle 5 states: Five eunuchs - yellow is the color of the central direction. Anciently punishing their sexual function, they were called "castrated persons." Because they guard the gates of the inner palace, hence the name. Another explanation: Ancient people valued superiority - third rank and above painted yellow on their gate tops. In these yellow-gate households, there was once someone who committed a transgression. The king sent someone to cut his organs to punish him. Later this person was used to guard the palace. The name was made from the original source. This castrated person originally came from a yellow-gate household. Hence later castrated ones were all called "yellow gates."

These non-males, though receiving human form, have weak bodies and wills, lack capacity for the Way, instead increase lustful defilement. Though advancing in learning, ultimately have no spiritual progress.

Regarding "made by cutting," Master Ying states: Popular texts call removing the genitals with a knife "cutting." *Daśabhāṇavāra* has five types, slightly different from this vinaya: 1) From birth unable to have sex, 2) Capable half the month - Li states: meaning having restraint, 3) Jealous - seeing others having sex, one's own form becomes aroused - Li states: aroused by others, stops when others stop, 4) Aroused when others have sex with one's body parts, 5) Diseased and rotting, or fallen to insects. The first four should be expelled, the last one allowed to remain.

The excerpt commentary also states: Regarding hermaphrodites, according to various treatises there are three types of hermaphrodites: 1) Can conceive oneself and cause others to conceive, 2) Can conceive oneself but cannot cause others to conceive.

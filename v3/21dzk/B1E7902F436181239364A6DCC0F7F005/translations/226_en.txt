If there is any action to be performed in whatever place, whatever manner, whatever time, all follows right mindfulness. Universally in all undertaken activities, universally in all differences of places and locations, universally in all methods of action, universally in all differences of time periods, mindfulness is without forgetting, constantly abiding in right mindfulness. This is called unforgetting mindfulness. The nature of constant abiding in equanimity refers to the six constant abiding dharmas. At the six sense gates, neither worrying nor rejoicing, only generating proper equanimity and observing objects equally. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra*, collection 31, fascicle 6, says: "Good object mindfulness is the unforgetting dharma. Non-attachment is the characteristic of the nature of constant abiding in equanimity." (See the eighteen unshared qualities in the above pure dharma gate, and also the unforgetting among the 130 unshared virtues.)

The *Compendium of Explanations*, fascicle 4 (in the chapter on peaceful practices), comments: "Constant abiding means that arhats abide in the six objects without joy, sorrow, etc." The *Great Treatise*, fascicle 50, says: "It refers to arhats whose outflows are exhausted. In the six constant abidings, constantly without interruption, mostly abiding peacefully. That is, having seen form with the eye, neither rejoicing nor worrying, peacefully abiding in superior equanimity, with right mindfulness and right awareness. Similarly, having heard sound with the ear, smelled fragrance with the nose, tasted flavor with the tongue, felt contact with the body, cognized dharmas with the mind, neither rejoicing nor worrying, peacefully abiding in superior equanimity, with right mindfulness and right awareness." (See *Vimalakīrti Commentary*, fascicle 2.)

**The Three Types of Majestic Power**

1. Sage's majestic power. 2. Dharma majestic power. 3. Innate majestic power.

In explanation: Sage's majestic power refers to the Buddha having cultivated and practiced samādhi power in the past, now depending on this to attain self-mastery, so that whatever he desires, all things are accomplished. Dharma majestic power refers to the bodhisattva in the past having cultivated the six perfections and various supreme dharmas, having vast fruition and great benefits, called dharma majestic power.

**Lower Section**

Innate power refers to the Buddha having previously accumulated vast merit and wisdom provisions, realizing extremely rare dharmas born together with him, called innate majestic power. The first sage's majestic power includes the six supernatural powers, etc.

**The Five Types of Power of the Self-Mastered One**

1. Samādhi power. 2. Supernatural power. 3. Borrowed consciousness (borrowing and arousing lower-realm consciousness while in upper realms). 4. Vow power. 5. Dharma majestic power. (All the above are easy to understand.)

*Commentary*, volume 3 (in the section on samādhi and supernatural powers), says: "Regarding the treatise from 'if samādhi and other powers' to 'then it is not definite.' In explanation: Speaking of 'samādhi and others' includes supernatural power, or borrowing consciousness arousal, or great vow power, or dharma majestic power. This applies to all consciousnesses having five types of power. If the eighth consciousness transforms, it has only samādhi and supernatural powers, or generally four powers. Great vows are identical to dharma power, having no separate capacity." Question: Why does the defiled eighth consciousness only limit itself to objects transformed by samādhi and supernatural powers, not cognizing objects transformed by other powers? *演秘* says: "Regarding the commentary's borrowed consciousness power: Question: What difference does it have from samādhi and supernatural power? Answer: When the body is in the upper realm, it does not arouse lower samādhi, supernatural powers, etc. The reason is as in the commentary. Because it arouses lower scattered consciousness, there is a difference. Question: In arousing lower scattered consciousness, doesn't it depend on the pull of upper samādhi and supernatural powers? If this is permitted, then it would be included in samādhi and supernatural powers. Why then open it separately? Answer: Not so, therefore it is opened separately. Question: Even if upper samādhi and supernatural powers serve as conditions for pulling, wouldn't this be acceptable? Answer: Even if samādhi and supernatural powers pull, this is still another realm. Therefore it is opened separately. Consider further." (See also the *Pivotal Essentials*.)

**The Eight Merit Waters** (See *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra Sound Training*, fascicle 2. The *Amitābha Sūtra Comprehensive Praise Commentary* is the same. See its lower fascicle for explanation of the eight merit waters. *Abhidharmakośa Light Commentary*,

fascicle 1, should be seen. It quotes the explanation from the *Sūtra Praising the Pure Land*.)

1. Clear and pure. 2. Pure and cool. 3. Sweet and beautiful. 4. Light and soft. 5. Moist and lustrous. 6. Peaceful and harmonious. 7. When drinking, removes hunger and thirst. 8. After drinking, nourishes all faculties.

1. Sweet. 2. Cool. 3. Soft. 4. Light. 5. Clear and pure. 6. Odorless. 7. Does not harm the throat. 8. After drinking, does not injure the abdomen.

The seven seas between these seven golden mountains each possess the eight merit waters. (See *Abhidharmakośa Verse Commentary*, fascicle 11.) The *Infinite Life Sūtra Commentary* says: "The eight merit waters are: light, cool, soft, beautiful, clear and pure, odorless, no suffering when drinking, harmonious and suitable after drinking." (Same as the *Abhidharmakośa*.)

The revered of the supramundane are the Three Jewels (as clarifying the above pure dharma gate). The revered of the mundane are elders and seniors. "Revered" refers to fathers and teachers. "Elders" refers to other virtuous people and elder brothers, etc. (See *Commentary on the Pure Land Treatise*.) Teachers and elders have separate essences. The four kindnesses of the world (see *Sutra of Contemplating the Mind Ground*, fascicle 3).

**Regarding the Three Actual Robes**

1. Saṃghāṭi robe (this pronunciation is corrupted; it should properly be called saṃghāti, also called saṃghā[?]. This means "combined"—cut and sewn together. Also called "multiply made." This robe is made by cutting and piecing. The other two robes may or may not be cut, namely from nine strips to twenty-five strips). 2. Uttarāsaṅga robe (formerly called uttarāsaṅga. This is called "upper wearing garment," also called "shoulder covering garment." This is the seven-strip robe). 3. Antarvāsa robe (formerly called antarvāsa. This is called "inner garment." This is the five-strip robe. Kāṣāya means "improper color," also called "stainless garment." Master Paramārtha said it is a reddish-colored robe. One should examine the various vinayas and their commentaries. Due to prolixity, I will not elaborate. See *Brahmajāla Sūtra Commentary Sound and Meaning*).

The *Vajracchedikā Commentary*, upper fascicle, says: "Wearing robes: there are three actual robes—saṃghāṭi, uttarāsaṅga,

**Lower Section**

and antarvāsa. Among these, the first robe is worn when entering royal cities and villages. The next robe is for dwelling among the community and teaching dharma. The next robe can be understood. Now wishing to enter the city, this reveals wearing the first robe." *Records of the Western Regions*, fascicle 1, says: "The Tathāgata squares and folds the saṃghā[?] and spreads it below, then the uttarāsaṅga, then the saṃghākakṣa (formerly called saṃghīkī, which is corrupted)." (See the ascetic practices of Ācārya Myōken of Tendai Ryōgon-in.) *Taehyeon's Brahmajāla Commentary*, lower fascicle, says: "Kāṣāya means 'improper color.' Because the five colors like blue form improper colors, it is called 'broken color.' Though speaking of 'blue, etc.,' it is not actually blue, etc. As in the *Mañjuśrī's Questions Sūtra*, Mañjuśrī addressed the Buddha: 'How many colored robes are there?' The Buddha told Mañjuśrī: 'Not greatly red, not greatly yellow, not greatly black, not greatly white—pure and dharma-conforming three dharma robes and other garments are all of such colors. Whether self-dyed or having others dye, properly pounded and completed, washed according to season, always kept clean. Such bedding may also use blue, yellow, mixed colors, etc.'"

**Regarding the Three Dharma Robes**

1. The robe of vigor (also called "armor." It means being able to encourage the proclamation of beneficial and joyful matters, not avoiding cold, heat, and other difficulties, just like wearing clothes). 2. The robe of gentle patience (meaning that through patience, one repels external enmity and harm so they cannot invade, just like cold and heat cannot touch. See *Prajñāpāramitā Detailed Praise*, upper fascicle). 3. The robe of conscience and shame (by revering the virtuous and good, and rejecting the violent and evil, having shame as its characteristic like clothing. Therefore it is called "the supreme garment of conscience and shame").

Nivāsana (also nirvāsana) means "lower garment" (see *Brahmajāla Sūtra Commentary Sound and Meaning*).

**The Five Meanings of Bhikṣu** (properly called bhikṣu; "bhikṣu" is corrupted. *Comprehensive Praise Commentary* says: "Also establishing the name based on grass, comparing to the five-virtue grass. Therefore called bhikṣu." *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sound*

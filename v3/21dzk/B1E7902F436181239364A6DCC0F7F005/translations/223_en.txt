There are ten types. This is abbreviated according to the verses. The above can be seen in the *Abhidharma Treatise*, fascicle thirteen, and *Meaning Repository*, fascicle five.

**Seventeenth: Clarifying the Six Direct Realizations of the *Presentation Treatise*** (As not explained in the *Consciousness-Only Treatise*, this is written in the section on names and stages of the three vehicles)

**Also Regarding the Eighteen Direct Realizations**

First is direct realization through hearing-generated wisdom; second is direct realization through reflection-generated wisdom; third is direct realization through cultivation-generated wisdom; fourth is direct realization through discernment-conducive wisdom (direct realization through the path of seeing); fifth is direct realization through cultivation-path wisdom; sixth is ultimate direct realization; seventh is direct realization through impurely purified conventional wisdom; eighth is direct realization through well-purified conventional wisdom; ninth is direct realization through ultimate meaning wisdom; tenth is direct realization through impurely purified discriminating wisdom with characteristics; eleventh is direct realization through well-purified discriminating wisdom with characteristics; twelfth is direct realization through well-purified non-discriminating wisdom with characteristics; thirteenth is direct realization through preparatory wisdom for accomplishing activities; fourteenth is direct realization through wisdom accomplishing activities; fifteenth is direct realization through post-accomplishment wisdom; sixteenth is direct realization through śrāvaka equipoised wisdom; seventeenth is direct realization through bodhisattva equipoised wisdom. This is quoted in the *Pivot Essentials*, lower fascicle, fascicle nine.

**Eighteenth: Clarifying the Three-Thousand Worlds**

First is the small thousand-world; second is the medium thousand-world; third is the great thousand-world.

The explanation states: The area illuminated by one sun and moon is called one world. In such a thousand worlds there are a thousand suns and moons, a thousand Mount Sumeru kings and so forth, plus four continents, a thousand six desire heavens, and a thousand Brahmā worlds. These combined are called the first small thousand-world. A thousand small thousand-worlds is called the second medium thousand-world. A thousand medium thousand-worlds is called the third great thousand-world. The *Profound Praise*, fascicle two, in explaining the introductory chapter of the sutra regarding the Sahā world ruler Great Brahmā King, etc.

**Lower Section**

explains this. Various texts should be consulted. The *Abhidharma Treatise*, fascicle six, says: "From human and divine destinies to wherever the pervading flowing light of one sun and moon illuminates is called one world. In such a thousand worlds there are a thousand suns and moons, a thousand Mount Sumeru mountains, a thousand four great continents up to a thousand Brahmā worlds. Thus collectively called the small thousand-world. A thousand small thousand-worlds is collectively called the second medium thousand-world. A thousand medium thousand-worlds is collectively called the third great thousand-world. Such a three-thousand great thousand-world has collectively a great surrounding mountain range encircling it. Also, this three-thousand great thousand-world undergoes destruction and formation together. It is like great raindrops the size of cart wheels, continuous and uninterrupted." The *Benevolent King Sūtra Commentary* has the same meaning. This is from many commentary sections by Ximingand Xingxin. The *Abhidharmakośa Verses*, fascicle eleven, says: "Four great continents, sun and moon, Sumeru, desire heavens, and Brahmā world are called one thousand, called one small thousand-world. A thousand times this small thousand is called one medium thousand. A thousand times this is a great thousand, all sharing one formation-destruction cycle." The explanation states: The *Light Commentary*, fascicle eleven, says: "Also the *Correct Logic* says: Because this only mentions Brahmā worlds for small thousands, lesser light and such are not included in small thousand-worlds. Because small thousand-worlds are accumulated to form medium and great thousands, medium and great thousands also do not include them. Also, 'small' means humble and low. Because the upper is excluded, like an ox with severed horns. Accumulating small to form the rest also does not include them." Now considering: Regarding the extent of the four dhyānas in the form realm, the *Vibhāṣā* and *Abhidharmakośa* each have two teachers' interpretations. First, equal to one four-continent area; second, equal to a small thousand-world area. Among these two interpretations, the one equal to one four-continent area is taken as correct. Therefore, the extent of the second dhyāna equals a small thousand-world, the extent of the third dhyāna equals a medium thousand-world, and the extent of the fourth dhyāna equals a three-thousand great thousand-world. Indeed, taking the four dhyānas of the form realm,

all can be called three thousand-worlds. Because they share formation and destruction. Question: "How does the fourth meditation undergo formation and destruction?" Answer: The verse says: "The three disasters of great water and wind, with the upper three concentrations as peaks. Like the sequential inner disasters, the fourth has none because it is immovable. However, those vessels are impermanent, arising and perishing together with sentient beings." The explanation states: Question: "Why does the fourth meditation have no external disasters?" Answer: The verse "the fourth has none because it is immovable." It has no external disasters. Because it is free from inner disasters. Because the Buddha explained that it is called immovable. Because internal and external three disasters cannot reach it. Question: "If so, the vessels of that ground should be permanent." Answer: The verse says "However, those vessels are impermanent, arising and perishing together with sentient beings." Namely, in heavenly places there is no overall terrain, but like various stars, each dwelling place is separate. When those gods are born, divine palaces arise accordingly; when those gods die, divine palaces perish accordingly. The *Supreme Victory Commentary*, fascicle two (at the lifespan chapter), says: "The numerical quantity of great thousand-world realms is indefinite. Refer to the *Yogācāra Excerpts*." The *Mind-Ground Contemplation Sūtra*, fascicle two, says: "In each leaf one Buddha appears. This is precisely a three-thousand great thousand-world. In each world there are billions of suns and moons, stars and planets, four great continents, six desire heavens and four dhyānas, space-sphere, consciousness-sphere, neither-perception-nor-non-perception, etc." The *Great Perfection of Wisdom*, fascicle 43, fascicle five, says: "At that time, in this three-thousand great thousand patient world, all the four heavenly kings came together in assembly with immeasurable hundreds of thousands of koṭis of four great king retinue gods and divine prince assemblies. All the Śakras came together in assembly with immeasurable hundreds of thousands of koṭis of gods who delight in others' transformations and divine prince assemblies. All the great Brahmā kings, all the extremely pure light gods, each came together in assembly with immeasurable hundreds of thousands of koṭis of second meditation heaven assemblies. All the universally pure gods and third meditation heaven assemblies came together in assembly. All the

broad result gods and fourth meditation heaven assemblies came together in assembly. All the highest form gods each came together in assembly with immeasurable thousands of koṭis of pure abode heaven assemblies. The pure karma maturation bodies of these four heavenly king great assemblies up to pure abode heaven assemblies, compared to the constant light manifested by the Tathāgata's body, do not reach even one hundredth part." The same collection, fascicle six, says: "At that time Śakra and the four heavenly king assemblies of this three-thousand great thousand-world up to the form-pinnacle gods formed this intention." All the above texts show that the eighteen heavens of the four dhyānas of the form realm encompass one three thousand-world. Also fascicle five says: "At that time Śakra said to Venerable Subhūti: 'Now in this three-thousand great thousand-world, all the four heavenly king gods up to the pure abode gods, etc.'" The *Profound Praise*, fascicle two, says: "From 'Sahā world' in the sūtra to 'together with twenty thousand divine princes.' The praise says: This form realm heaven is called 'sahā' in Sanskrit, which means 'patient.' When bodhisattvas and others practice benefit and joy, there are many resentments and jealousies, and various sufferings press and afflict, but they can endure toil and fatigue, patiently accepting merit, so they take this as their name. 'Sahā' is a corruption. The great and small [extents] of the first dhyāna equal one four-continent area of the desire realm. One thousand first dhyānas begin to equal the second dhyāna. The second dhyāna is the peak of fire disaster. One thousand second dhyānas begin to equal the third dhyāna. The third dhyāna is the peak of water disaster. One thousand third dhyānas begin to equal the fourth dhyāna. As the peak of wind disaster, up to the three-thousand great thousand-world being called the Sahā world. Therefore the Sahā world ruler Great Brahmā King is precisely the fourth dhyāna king. Brahmā-silence is tranquil, pure, and clean, all attained. Also called pure cleanliness. Now only saying 'Brahmā' is simply abbreviated speech. Śikhin is the peak of fire disaster; the peak is precisely the ruler of the first dhyāna because it is the peak of fire disaster. Light-brightness refers to the second dhyāna king: lesser light, immeasurable light, extremely pure light heaven kings, etc.

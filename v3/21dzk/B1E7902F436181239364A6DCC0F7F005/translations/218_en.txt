Transformation. According to one explanation, seven principles, namely the great, ego-pride, and five subtle elements. According to another explanation, including the five gross elements makes twelve dharmas. Because they arise from others and also generate others. Fourth, neither fundamental nor transformational - this refers to the spiritual self principle. Extensively as twenty-five principles: 1) essential nature, 2) great, 3) ego-pride, 4) five subtle elements, 5) five gross elements, 6) five cognitive faculties, 7) five action faculties, 8) mind-evenness faculty, 9) self-knower. Among thirty-nine positions, they are divided into twenty-five principles.

Question: "How can essential nature serve as the generating cause for all dharmas?" Answer: "Because the three guṇas combine, they can generate all principles. The three guṇas are: in Sanskrit called 'sattva,' translated as 'sentient being' or 'brave and strong' - we take the meaning of 'brave.' In Sanskrit called 'rajas' - this is named 'bird-subtle.' Dust particles, etc., are all rajas. This is named 'dust disturbance.' We take the meaning of 'dust.' This is the initial translation. In Sanskrit called 'tamas' - this is named 'darkness,' the darkness of dullness and obscurity. The three guṇas should be called 'brave-dust-darkness.' If translated by secondary meaning, anciently called 'passion-coarseness-blackness,' now yellow-red-black; old names were joy-sorrow-darkness, now called greed-anger-delusion. Now we say 'pleasure-suffering-equanimity.' An outsider asks: 'In this meaning, is the self-knower an agent or experiencer?' The answer is for the sake of manifesting meaning. 'Meaning' refers to objects. It is certifying knowledge of objects. The self is the knower, not one unable to know. Moreover, from primordial nature, after already being transformed, because the self experiences and uses it. Regarding sequential generation: essential nature is originally existent, unconditioned and permanently abiding. It can only generate others, not arise from others. Through the self arousing thought to experience and use realms, from essential nature first arises the 'great.' 'Great' means the meaning of increase. Because the characteristics of essential nature increase, it is called 'great.' The self is called 'awareness' and also 'all-pervading.' Called 'cognition' and 'wisdom.' From the great arises ego-attachment. Ego-attachment means essential nature arousing function to observe the self. Because it conforms to objects, it is called ego-attachment. Initially it also transforms differently, also called 'grease.' According to one explanation, ego-pride generates the ten dharmas of [five characters] great five subtle elements. The five gross elements are earth, water, fire, wind, and space. There is separately one thing called space - not unconditioned space or space-sphere form, etc. The five subtle elements are sound, touch, form, taste, and odor... 'Measure' means fixed meaning. Only fixing and using these to form the gross elements, faculties, etc... The five cognitive faculties are eye, ear, nose, tongue, and skin. Next generating the five action faculties. The five action faculties are: 1) speech organ, 2) hands, 3) feet, 4) urination [organ], 5) defecation place. Among these, the speech organ refers to what speech requires - mouth, tongue, etc. Among these, hands and feet are divisions of portions of the skin faculty. Previously taking the general skin, now taking the limbs. Moreover, male and female major and minor elimination organs, etc., have separate functions, so are established separately. Next generates the mind faculty. The *Golden Seventy Treatise* takes discrimination as substance. According to one explanation, this takes inner mind as substance. The spiritual self takes thought as substance. Therefore *Hetuvidyā* explains that they cling to 'self is thought.' The three guṣas are the cause of saṃsāra. Through being disturbed by transformations, they do not attain liberation. Knowing the twenty-three principles' transformation and impermanence, they generate disgust and cultivate the path. Essential nature conceals its traces and does not generate the principles, so the self then attains liberation." The above is from Commentary fascicle one. For details, see *Hetuvidyā Private Records* middle fascicle and *Lamp of Definitive Meaning* second fascicle.

Regarding Vaiśeṣika non-Buddhists, see the *Consciousness-Only Commentary* and *Hetuvidyā Commentary*. Due to complexity, this is abbreviated.

**Four Vedic Treatises** (Anciently called "Dragging Treatise Canon" or "Four Vigorous Treatises" - all mistranslations. This translates as "Four Clarity Treatises.")

1. Āyurveda (called "Life Clarity" - concerning longevity matters)
2. Yajurveda (called "Sacrificial Record Clarity" - clarifying sacrificial matters)  
3. Sāmaveda (called "Equalization Clarity" - equalizing right and wrong matters)
4. Atharvaveda (called "Technique Clarity" - clarifying technical matters)

(Magic, incantations, etc. - those who can master all these are the fourth clarity.)

See *Supreme Commentary* fascicle five. (The eighteen great scripture locations, etc.)

*Western Regions Record* fascicle two states: "Four Veda treatises (the ancient 'Veda' is a corruption):
1. Called 'Life' - refers to nourishing life and cultivating nature
2. Called 'Sacrifice' - refers to offerings and prayers  
3. Called 'Equalization' - refers to ritual propriety, divination, military tactics, and army formations
4. Called 'Techniques' - refers to extraordinary abilities, mathematical arts, incantations, and medical prescriptions"

**○ Ninth: Hīnayāna Schools** (with name categories appended)

**Twenty Hīnayāna Schools** (After the Buddha's nirvana, in the early three hundredth year, there were Hīnayāna disputes and divisions into two schools. First, the Sarvāstivāda school, also called Sarvāstivāda school. Second, the original Sthavira school, which transformed into the Haimavata school. From the Mahāsāṃghika school, eight schools split off, making nine schools total including the original.)

From the Mahāsāṃghika school, eight schools split off, making nine schools total including the original: 1) Mahāsāṃghika, 2) Ekavyavahārika, 3) Lokottaravāda, 4) Kaukkuṭika, 5) Bahuśrutīya, 6) Prajñaptivāda, 7) Caitika, 8) Aparaśaila, 9) Uttaraśaila. From the Sthavira school, ten schools split off, making eleven schools total including the original: 1) Sarvāstivāda (also called Sarvāstivāda), 2) Haimavata (also called Sthavira school, also called Haimavata), 3) Vātsīputrīya, 4) Dharmottarīya, 5) Bhadrayānīya, 6) Saṃmatīya, 7) Ṣaṇṇagarika, 8) Mahīśāsaka, 9) Dharmaguptaka (also called Dharma school), 10) Kāśyapīya (also called Good), 11) Sautrāntika (also called Śūnyavāda teachers). Combined, they form twenty schools. The traditionally transmitted eighteen schools is a serious textual error. The Paramārtha Tripiṭaka's nineteen schools omits the Aparaśaila school - also incorrect. The *Mañjuśrī-prajñāpāramitā-sūtra* lower fascicle states "among the great assembly are eight, among the elder schools are twelve schools" - this is a translator's error.

Explanation: The Mahāsāṃghika school - after the Buddha's nirvana, when compiling Buddha's scriptures at two locations inside and outside the boundary, the assembly outside the boundary had no separate leaders, and because they followed the number of tens of thousands in the assembly, they were simply called "Great Assembly" (Mahāsāṃgha). Later, when it came to Mahādeva's time, disputes arose. The descendants outside the boundary mostly followed and adopted his explanations. The ancient designation was the Mahāsāṃghika school. The Ekavyavahārika school - this master explained: "All dharmas of worldly and supramundane existence have only conventional names and all lack real substance." Names are liberations. Following what they established, they are called the Ekavyavahārika school. The Lokottaravāda school - this school claimed: "Worldly dharmas are the four types of delusion, afflictions, karma, and worldly results that arise in transformation sequence. Being already deludedly arisen, they are merely conventional names with no real substance whatsoever. Supramundane dharmas do not arise from delusion, so path and fruition are all really existent." They take their name from what they established. The Kaukkuṭika school - in ancient times there was a sage who, pressed by lustful desire, pursued and was defiled by a chicken. Because of the children thus born, that clan was called Kaukkuṭika (Chicken Lineage). This is a sage caste lineage among Brahmins, so the school name is thus. The Bahuśrutīya school - they extensively studied the Tripiṭaka and deeply understood the Buddha's words. They take their name from virtue. The Prajñaptivāda school - the Prajñaptivāda master claimed: "Worldly and supramundane dharmas all have conventional and real aspects. Aggregates are real, sense-bases are conventional." They also gained their name from what they established. The Caitika school - "Caitya" is Sanskrit, translated as "sacred shrine" - a shrine place for installing sacred spirits. The mountain has a caitya, so the mountain gained this name. People dwelling dependent on the mountain form a school, taking their designation from the mountain where they dwell. The Aparaśaila school - located west of Caitya Mountain, people dwelling there take this as their name. The Uttaraśaila school - its meaning is the same as the Western Mountain. The Sarvāstivāda school - "all exists" has two types. First...

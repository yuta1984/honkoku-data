Regarding what it counteracts, following the differences in explanation, though one, there are many kinds of names. Concerning the various names of tathatā, see Commentary Volume 2 and 9, Vijñaptimātra Chapter, Xuanzan Volume 4, Yanmi Volume 7 and 9, and Vijñaptimātra Private Notes Volume 4.

The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sound Commentary Volume 1 states: "Tathatā - the Vijñaptimātra treatise says 'true means real, like means as-constant.' Dharmadhātu (because it is the cause of noble dharmas), dharmatā (because it is the essence of all dharmas), non-falsity (because it is tranquil and free from error), non-transformation (because it constantly does not change), equality (because it pervades all dharmas), non-arising nature (because it is free from birth-convenience nature), dharma-establishment (because its nature definitely exists), dharma-abiding (because it abides in all dharmas), reality-limit (because it is the object without error), space-element (because it contains and accommodates all dharmas), inconceivable (because it is free from the causes of verbal expression). The above is tathatā, and the following eleven are all alternative names for tathatā. Cessation-realm (because the practices of seeing-elimination are separated), separation-realm (because the practices of cultivation-elimination are separated), extinction-realm (because attachments to various existences are extinguished), peaceful-realm (because it is far from arising and cessation), natureless-realm (because it has no self-nature), signless-realm (because it has no ten characteristics), non-action realm (because it is not a conditioned dharma), unconditioned-realm (because it has characteristics of non-arising, etc.), tranquil-realm (because it eliminates greed, etc.), original non-existence (because there is originally no obstruction), reality-limit (as explained above), ultimate nirvana (because of complete liberation), non-arising (because it is not something present now), non-cessation (because it is not a dharma that will be absent later), non-defilement (because of original pure nature), impermanence (because of defilement by adventitious dust). The above sixteen names are alternative names for nirvana.

The Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra, first collection, first volume states: 'Tathatā, like space, dharmadhātu, dharmatā, non-falsity, non-transformation, inconceivable realm, space-element, cessation-realm, separation-realm, extinction-realm, equality, non-arising nature, dharma-establishment, dharma-abiding, natureless-realm, signless-realm, non-action realm, unconditioned-realm, peaceful-realm, tranquil-realm, original non-existence, reality-limit, ultimate nirvana.' Volume 3 is the same. The above twenty-four names are alternative names for nirvana. This can be seen in the sixth collection, fifth volume.

Vijñaptimātra Meaning Volume 4 states: "Among the above fourteen names, the eleven names of dharmadhātu, etc., are separately explained in Mahāprajñāpāramitā 296.

【Lower Section】
The three names dharma-position, selflessness, and ultimate meaning are not in the sutra." The name dharma-position is in the Lotus Sutra, and the names selflessness and ultimate meaning are in the Madhyāntavibhāga. Also, the explanations of these names differ in various places. Now I only述べ one explanation.

Commentary Volume 9 states: "The treatise also says from 'manifesting this' to 'extensively explaining according to meaning.' It states: The Mahāprajñāpāramitā has twelve names, as explained in the previous second section. Also, Abhidharma Volume 2 has seven names, from tathatā to dharmadhātu. This treatise's root verses have only two names."

Section 2: Clarifying the Various Names of Vijñaptimātra

There are generally five categories:

Category 1, Category 2, Category 3, Category 4, Category 5.

Category 1 has thirty-one types, Category 2 has four types, Category 3 has four types, Category 4 has four types, Category 5 has one type. In total, there are forty-four names.

Single Names - Thirty-one Categories

1. Mind-only (explained in the Avatamsaka, etc. Blocking objects and separating from consciousness is called mind-only)
2. Middle Way (explained in the Madhyāntavibhāga. Blocking the path of one-sided attachment is called the Middle Way)
3. Prajñāpāramitā (explained in the Prajñā sutras. The discriminating nature is called Prajñāpāramitā)
4. One Vehicle (explained in the Lotus Sutra. Clarifying ultimate conveyance is called One Vehicle)

The above four names encompass both subject and object of observation, true and conventional realms of observation. Direct cognition is entirely true only, preparatory and subsequently-attained [cognitions] encompass both true and conventional, while verbal expressions are conventional only in subsequently-attained [cognition].

5. One Real Essence (explained in the Śrīmālā Sūtra. Blocking other falsities is called One Real Essence)
6. One Support (the Śrīmālā Sūtra manifests the root of dharmas and also calls it One Support)
7. Emptiness (the same sutra uses emptiness as realization, and also being empty nature, it is called emptiness)
8. Tathāgatagarbha (the same sutra manifests difference, showing emergence from bondage and inclusion of Buddha qualities. Because Buddha emerges from within, it is called Tathāgatagarbha)
9. Intrinsically Pure Mind (the same sutra clarifies the undefiled true dharma-nature and calls it Intrinsically Pure Mind)
10. Dharmakāya (the same sutra calls the merit-nature Dharmakāya)
11. Gate of Non-duality (explained in the Vimalakīrti Sūtra. Blocking differences in principle is called the Gate of Non-duality)
12. Neither Arising nor Ceasing (explained in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra. Expressing the absence of beginning and end is called neither arising nor ceasing)
13. Buddha-nature (explained in the Nirvana Sutra. Manifesting the cause of Dharmakāya is called Buddha-nature)
14. Inconceivable (explained in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra. Expressing separation from verbal expression is called inconceivable)
15. Non-established (explained in the Yogācāra treatise. Showing it is not artificially established is called non-established)
16. Perfectly Accomplished (the Mahāyānasaṃgraha shows this is universal, eternal, etc., and calls it Perfectly Accomplished)
17. Tathatā (the Abhidharma treatise clarifies it is not false or perverted and calls it tathatā)

The above thirteen categories of names refer only to the principle that is observed, the realm of true wisdom only. Adding the fourteen names such as dharmadhātu and dharmatā to these seventeen names makes thirty-one single names. Dharmadhātu, etc., are as explained above.

Two-Name Categories - Four Types

1. Called Established Truths and Non-established Truths.

【Lower Section】
The Yogācāra treatise calls them established and non-established truths based on the differences in depth between what is established and what is not established.

The chapter states: "These are the conditioned Four Noble Truths and unconditioned Four Noble Truths in the Śrīmālā Sūtra."

2. Called Ultimate Truth and Conventional Truth (explained in the Nirvana Sutra)

3. Called Name-investigation and Thing-investigation.

The Prakaraṇa treatise calls the signifier and signified the two dharmas of name and thing. Name is the characteristic of the signifier, thing is the characteristic of the signified. That treatise's twelfth volume explains five types of characteristics: 1) signified characteristic, 2) signifier characteristic, 3) the characteristic of correlation between these two, 4) attachment characteristic, 5) non-attachment characteristic. The signified characteristic refers to the five dharmas of characteristics, etc. As explained in the Five Dharma Treasury, these are dharmas established by the Vātsīputrīya school, namely the three times, the unconditioned, and the inexpressible. This can be seen in Lamp Volume 2 and the Mahāprajñāpāramitā, etc. The signifier characteristic refers to verbal expressions that exist for explaining the essential nature and distinctions of all dharmas, depending on conventional names, etc., regarding those dharmas. This also manifests the essential nature of the imagined [nature]. The remaining three meanings are not clarified here, so they are not explained.

The meaning is: the five dharmas of characteristics, names, discrimination, correct wisdom, and tathatā are the signified characteristics, and verbal expressions issued to explain the essential nature and distinctions of these five dharmas are the signifier characteristics, called the two dharmas of name and thing.

These three names encompass both subject and object of observation, being both true and conventional, [encompassing] initial, middle, and final wisdom.

This can be seen in Vijñaptimātra Private Notes Volume 4. These three names are equivalent to three types of names among the four types of two-name categories.

4. Called the Two Selflessnesses of Persons and Dharmas.

The Mahāyānasaṃgraha manifests the absence of what is imagined and calls them the two selflessnesses of persons and dharmas. This also encompasses both subject and object of observation.

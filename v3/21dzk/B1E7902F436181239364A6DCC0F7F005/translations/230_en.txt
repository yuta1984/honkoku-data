Announcing to the assembly: "You should listen to the formal act. Venerable assembly, listen (and so forth as stated above)." At this first formal act, ask whether the assembly is accomplished. Tell the ordinand: "The first formal act has been completed. The assembly all agrees. Now all good dharmas of the ten directions and dharma realms are all set in motion. You should give rise to shame. Do not indulge in negligent thoughts." Next perform the second formal act. Having asked as above, tell the ordinand: "The second formal act has been completed. The dharma and assembly are both in harmony. All good dharmas of the ten directions and dharma realms are gathered together in empty space." When the time of the third formal act arrives, the merit of the dharma realm enters your body and mind. One formal act remains with you. You should arouse your body and, taking the mind of all empty space as condition, rescue and gather the sentient beings of the three realms of existence, and also wish to protect and maintain the Buddha-dharma of the three times. Truly relying on these words, announce to the assembly: "I pray the assembly simultaneously show compassion to save past lives, together join palms and assist. Raise up this formal act and immediately perform it." Up to "this matter is thus, this matter is thus, completed."

The words of the second and third formal acts are as above. Regarding the white-four formal act, the *Brahmajāla Sūtra Commentary Sound and Meaning* says: "Namely, the white announcement plus three formal acts - this is called 'white-four.'" The three formal acts are: first, single formal act, meaning matters easily expressed and known; second, white formal act, meaning respectful discussion within the matter; third, white-four formal act, though matters are layered, they are harmoniously resolved.

Alternatively it is said: There are three formal acts: first, single white formal act; second, white-two formal act; third, white-four formal act. The first single white has only one announcement, with no subsequent procedure, hence called "single white." The middle has one white and one formal act; because the white connects to the formal act, it's called "white-two." The third follows this pattern. Generally speaking, all three are formal acts; specifically speaking, there is a white announcement that is not a formal act.

**Four Types of Formal Acts** (Explained in *Yogācārabhūmi* fascicle 99, which should be referenced)

**Lower Section**

1. Single white formal act. 2. White-two formal act. 3. White-four formal act. 4. Three-word formal act (meaning the Three Refuges, explained in the *Chapter on Manifest and Non-manifest [Karma]*).

These four formal acts briefly have two matters as their basis: first, sentient being-related matters as basis; second, non-sentient being-related matters as basis. Sentient being-related matters as basis means: ordination formal acts, receiving full ordination formal acts, individual consent formal acts, confession formal acts, suspension formal acts, expulsion formal acts, rainy season retreat formal acts for seven, twenty, forty days and nights, etc. Thus, formal acts are established either to gather and receive sentient beings or to discipline and subdue sentient beings. This is called "formal acts with sentient being-related matters as basis." Non-sentient being-related matters as basis means: formal acts for receiving and maintaining robes and bowls, formal acts for holding kaṭhina robes and not abandoning protective robes, boundary-marking formal acts, formal acts for pure ground and grain consent, etc. Such categories of formal acts should be known as "formal acts with non-sentient related matters as basis."

*Yogācārabhūmi* fascicle 69 explains ten formal acts: namely, 1. receiving full ordination formal act, 2. boundary-marking formal act, 3. cultivation formal act, 4. consent formal act, 5. directional formal act, 6. unrestricted raising formal act, 7. disciplinary punishment formal act, 8. gathering and receiving formal act, 9. white-two formal act, 10. white-four formal act. The meaning of formal acts is not explained here.

The *Chapter on Manifest and Non-manifest [Karma]* says: "Fifth, the limits of obtaining and abandoning ○ Within obtaining there are again two: 1. obtaining conditions, 2. time periods. Obtaining conditions again has two: 1. discriminating conditions, 2. non-discriminating conditions. The first discriminating conditions exist only in the full prātimokṣa precepts. Non-discriminating conditions exist universally in all. Discriminating conditions have two: 1. conditions for obtaining full liberation.

liberation conditions, 2. formal act conditions for obtaining individual liberation. The first conditions exist universally in Buddha and disciples. Formal acts do not apply to Buddha and pratyekabuddhas. However, both encompass present time and post-extinction periods. Furthermore, conditions for obtaining full individual liberation differ among various teachings. There are different explanations among the four vinayas and five treatises. The four vinayas are: 1. *Sarvāstivāda Vinaya*, which belongs to the Sarvāstivāda school, same as *Abhidharmakośa* fascicle 14, *Vinaya Vibhāṣā* together with *Saṃyuktābhidharmahṛdaya* and *Nyāyānusāra* school, and *Mahāvibhāṣā*. The *Sarvāstivāda Vinaya* says: "When the Buddha was in the Bamboo Grove, he told the monks: There are ten types of receiving full ordination. 1. Natural attainment, meaning Buddha and pratyekabuddhas naturally attain it at the stage of final knowledge. 2. Seeing truth attainment - *Abhidharmakośa* etc. say: entering the correct nature free from birth, namely the five bhikṣus. 3. 'Come well' attainment - *Abhidharmakośa* etc. say: Buddha commands 'Come well,' meaning Yaśas etc. Only Buddha himself does this, not within others' capability, due to complete Way-being. 4. Self-vow attainment - *Abhidharmakośa* etc. say: believing in Buddha as great teacher, meaning Mahākāśyapa. 5. Debate attainment - *Abhidharmakośa* etc. say: skillfully responding to questions asked, meaning Sudāyi. At age seven, Buddha asked 'Where is your home?' He answered Buddha 'No home in the three realms.' Buddha praised his intelligent answer to the question. Though not yet of full age, he had the assembly receive [ordination]. Not that he immediately received precepts upon answering. 6. Receiving weighty dharma - *Abhidharmakośa* etc. say: respectfully receiving the eight weighty dharmas, meaning Mahāprajāpatī. 7. Messenger attainment - *Abhidharmakośa* etc. say: meaning Dharmadattā bhikṣuṇī. *Pañcavarga Vinaya* says: the courtesan Utpalāvarṇā. 8. Elder attainment, 9. formal act, 10. Three Refuges. *Abhidharmakośa* etc. say: reciting Buddha, Dharma, Sangha three times, meaning the sixty worthy groups. There were sixty-two groups of worthy assemblies who gathered together and sent arhats to explain the Three Refuges, then obtained full [ordination]. Hence called 'Three Refuges attainment.'

Also called 'three-word attainment.' Why do nuns not have Three Refuges attainment? Because there are no worthy assemblies.

All four vinayas and five treatises reference this. Due to prolixity this is abbreviated. The chapters should be consulted.

**Four Vinayas**

1. *Sarvāstivāda Vinaya* (explains ten types of receiving precepts; Sarvāstivāda school). 2. *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya* (explains five types of receiving precepts; Dharmaguptaka school). 3. *Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya* (explains four types of receiving precepts; Mahāsāṃghika school). 4. *Mahīśāsaka Vinaya* (explains five types of receiving full precepts; Mahīśāsaka school).

**Five Treatises**

1. *Vinaya-mātṛkā* (says monks and nuns, two assemblies each have five types of receiving precepts. The treatise appears to agree with Sarvāstivāda). 2. *Mātrka* (explains ten types of receiving precepts. This treatise appears to agree with Sarvāstivāda). 3. *Samantapāsādikā* (explains eight types of receiving precepts). 4. *Sarvāstivāda-vinaya-vibhāṣā* (explains seven types of receiving full [ordination]. Sarvāstivāda masters, same as *Abhidharmakośa*). 5. *Sphuṭārthā* (monks and nuns combined have seven types of receiving precepts).

Monks four types, nuns three types. The above is the śrāvaka vehicle. Next pratyekabuddhas, then Buddha. This *Sphuṭārthā* explains regarding the three vehicles. Same as Sarvāstivāda and *Mahīśāsaka Vinaya*. The *Chapter on Manifest and Non-manifest* should be consulted.

**Chapter 5: Clarifying the Seven Treasures of a Wheel-turning King**

1. Queen treasure. 2. Wish-fulfilling gem treasure (*Prajñāpāramitā* fascicle 350 says the wish-fulfilling jewel is one chi six cun long. *Āgama Sūtra* says...). 3. Wheel treasure. 4. Elephant treasure. 5. Horse treasure. 6. Minister. 7. Treasurer treasure.

The queen's virtues: from body, speech, etc., emanate the fragrance of priceless sandalwood and utpala flowers. Body contact

What is taught [...] Thus, although pudgala (individuals) are not truly existent, there are [questions of] whether such faults in their bodies are severed or not, whether such virtues are realized or not. Therefore, pudgala are established. How are they established? There are seven types of distinctions: first, affliction-conduct distinctions [...] seventh, practice distinctions.

Affliction-conduct distinctions have seven types: first, craving conduct; second, hatred conduct; third, delusion conduct; fourth, pride conduct; fifth, investigation and analysis conduct; sixth, balanced conduct; seventh, thin-dust conduct.

Liberation distinctions have three types: namely, the śrāvaka vehicle, pratyekabuddha vehicle, and Mahāyāna.

Sustaining distinctions have three types: those who have not yet accumulated provisions, those who have accumulated but not yet accumulated provisions, and those who have already accumulated provisions.

Skillful means distinctions have two types: namely, faith-followers and dharma-followers.

Result distinctions have twenty-seven types: faith-liberated, direct-attainer, and other noble persons.

Realm distinctions refer to ordinary beings, learners, and non-learners in the desire realm. Just as the desire realm has three types, the upper realms are also the same. There are also bodhisattvas in the desire and form realms. There are also pratyekabuddhas in the desire realm and inconceivable tathāgatas.

Practice distinctions have five types: first, understanding-conduct bodhisattvas; second, superior aspiration bodhisattvas; third, characterized-conduct bodhisattvas; fourth, characterless-conduct bodhisattvas; fifth, effortless-conduct bodhisattvas. Such pudgala have immeasurable distinctions.

The explanation states: Craving-conduct pudgala are those with intense, long-lasting craving. Even regarding inferior, lovely sense-objects, they can generate superior craving. Because it arises for a long time without interruption. [...] Investigation-analysis-conduct individuals are also the same. Each, following their own objects, [acts] intensely and for long periods. Configure and explain according to principle.

Balanced-conduct pudgala are those with afflictions dwelling in their natural state, far removed from the intense and weak, dwelling in an equal state of various afflictions. Because afflictions manifest according to the power of sense-objects.

Thin-dust-conduct pudgala are those with thin afflictions dwelling in their natural state. As explained before, compared to afflictions in their natural state, these are subtle. Even regarding superior objective sense-spheres, subtle nature manifests. Because they are crushed by the power of superior antidotes cultivated in the past.

Liberation distinctions [the characteristics of the three vehicles are as before]. Among sustaining distinctions, pudgala who have not yet accumulated provisions are those who, taking truth-supreme dharmas as objects, generate soft-grade pure faithful understanding and accomplish warming-grade liberation-conducive factors, but have not yet determined their birth.

Pudgala who have accumulated but not yet accumulated provisions are those who, taking truth-supreme dharmas as objects, generate middle-grade pure faithful superior understanding, accomplish middle-grade liberation-conducive factors, and have already determined their birth.

Pudgala who have already accumulated provisions are those who, taking supreme dharmas as objects, generate superior-grade pure faithful superior understanding, accomplish superior-grade liberation-conducive factors, in this very birth.

Also, those who have not yet accumulated provisions are those who, taking truth-supreme dharmas as objects, accomplish inferior-grade truth-examining dharma-patience among the various truths, accomplish inferior-grade discernment-conducive factors, but have not yet determined their birth.

Those who have accumulated but not yet accumulated provisions are those who, taking supreme dharmas as objects, accomplish middle-grade truth-examining dharma-patience among the various truths, accomplish discernment-conducive factors, and have already determined their birth.

Those who have already accumulated provisions are those who, taking truth-supreme dharmas as objects, accomplish superior-grade truth-examining dharma-patience among the various truths, accomplish superior-grade discernment-conducive factors, in this very birth.

These three types of pudgala, by accomplishing each of the three grades of liberation-conducive and discernment-conducive factors, regarding the ability to induce discernment-conducive factors and truth direct-realization, according to their sequence: undetermined, already determined, in this very birth. The characteristic of pure faithful superior understanding regarding truth-supreme dharmas is liberation-conducive factors;

**Left Page**

The characteristic of truth-examining dharma-patience regarding these dharmas is discernment-conducive factors. According to their sequence: because faith is supreme, because wisdom is supreme.

The three grades of discernment-conducive factors here exclude the supreme mundane dharma. Because the nature of the supreme dharma is only one moment and necessarily does not continue. In this very birth, one definitely enters direct realization. Because it is not the previous stage.

From the inferior and middle grades of liberation-conducive and discernment-conducive factors, there can be regression. This only regresses from manifestation, not from latent impressions. The Bhagavān taught: "If there is one who possesses supreme mundane right view, even experiencing births for a thousand years, they will not fall into evil destinies."

Question: "Although provisions can be called preparatory practices, preparatory practices are not called provisions. Why then are the three grades of discernment-conducive factors all called provisions? According to the same treatise, fascicle eight: 'Also there are five types: namely, the path of provisions, the path of preparation, the path of seeing, the path of cultivation, the path of completion [...] The path of preparation refers to all provisions being preparation, not provisions.'"

Answer: "*Commentary* fascicle nine, end, has two explanations of equal and unequal. Among them, the former explanation is superior. The meaning is: establishing three grades in the discernment-conducive stage, using warming, peak, and patience to respectively correspond to not-yet-accumulated, already-accumulated, undetermined-birth, determined-birth, and this-very-birth time. Excluding supreme mundane dharma because it is only one moment. Cannot establish it. Although superior patience is one moment, because it excludes supreme mundane dharma. 'This very birth time': liberation-conducive factors speak about one lifetime; discernment-conducive factors' 'this very time' speaks about momentary birth. Another explanation: both stages speak about one lifetime. Although 'this very birth time,' since they exclude supreme mundane dharma, clearly it refers to one lifetime. Both meanings are obtained."

Skillful means distinctions, result distinctions [as before].

Realm distinctions: among the three types each realm has, desire-realm ordinary-being pudgala are those who are born and grow up in the desire realm without attaining noble dharmas.

Desire-realm learner pudgala are those who are born and grow up in the desire realm, have already attained noble dharmas, but still have remaining fetters.

Desire-realm non-learner pudgala are those who are born and grow up in the desire realm, have already attained noble dharmas, and have no remaining fetters. Just as the desire realm has three types of pudgala, the upper realms each also have three types.

Also, the desire and form realms each have bodhisattvas. Desire-realm bodhisattvas are those who correspond to meditations that eliminate formless-realm birth, dwell in meditative bliss, and are born in the desire realm or form realm.

Question: "For what reason are bodhisattvas not born in the formless realm?"

Answer: "If they have already realized and attained what is received by bodhisattvas of supreme awesome virtue, they all desire to benefit and bring peace to sentient beings. Because the formless realm is not a place of accomplishment. 'Meditation eliminating formless-realm birth' means removing the superior meditations possessed by the formless realm. 'Dwelling in meditative bliss' means not regressing from meditation. Because these bodhisattvas skillfully turn around, desiring to accomplish the sentient beings to be transformed, they are born either in the desire realm or form realm."

Pratyekabuddhas are those who emerge in times without buddhas, are born in the desire realm, and naturally realize and attain pratyekabuddha enlightenment.

Inconceivable tathāgatas are those who also in the desire realm, from initially manifesting dwelling in the wonderful jeweled palaces of Tuṣita Heaven, up to manifesting great parinirvāṇa, manifest all the great practices practiced by buddhas and bodhisattvas. All bodhisattva practices refer to from Tuṣita Heaven up to manifesting great supernatural transformations and subduing demon armies. All buddha practices refer to from manifesting perfect enlightenment up to manifesting great parinirvāṇa.

Question: "Why are śrāvakas not established in desire-realm distinctions?"

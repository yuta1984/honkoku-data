**First: Clarifying the Two Types of Provisional Designations Explained in the Vijñānavāda Treatise**

The verse states: "Through provisional designation, self and dharmas, etc." The commentary says: "These three-two explanations." The first explanation states in the commentary: "Provisional designations have two types."

1. **Substanceless Following-Sentiment Provisional** (The commentary states: "Mostly what worldly non-Buddhists grasp. Although there are no self and dharmas as they grasp them, following the conditions of the grasping mind, they are also called self and dharmas. Therefore they are called provisional").

2. **Substantial Explanatory Provisional** (The commentary states: "What the holy teachings explain, though having dharma-substance, is not self and dharmas. That is, the substance has no name. Forcibly naming them self and dharmas does not accord with the dharma-substance but follows conditions in establishment. Therefore they are called provisional").

The commentary explains substanceless following-sentiment provisional: "This generally shows that due to the discriminating mind that has been erroneously conceptualizing self and dharmas since beginningless time, the ālaya consciousness is perfumed, and subsequently subject-object aspects arise. Ordinary beings do not understand this is only inner consciousness, and depending on this, they erroneously conceptualize real self and dharmas. Self and dharmas are actually non-existent. Following the characteristics of what deluded sentiment grasps, they are named self and dharmas. Therefore know that the self and dharmas spoken of in the world are provisional, not real. Therefore the sūtra verse says: 'As the ignorant discriminate, external objects are all actually non-existent. Because habitual tendencies disturb and muddy the mind, it transforms resembling them.'"

The commentary explains substantial establishment provisional: "The noble ones provisionally depend on the characteristics or perceptions transformed by inner consciousness. In order to give rise to discourse, eliminate defilements, grasp purity, and generate true perception, they provisionally establish names and make objects into self and dharmas. The dharma-substance is actually neither self nor dharmas. Therefore know that the self and dharmas explained in the holy teachings are also provisional establishments. Therefore the sūtra says: 'In order to counter and eliminate the real self and dharmas grasped by ordinary beings, provisional names of self and dharmas are explained regarding what consciousness transforms.'"

The second explanation:

1. **Using Non-existence to Depend on Existence Provisional** (The commentary states: "The self and dharmas grasped by the world have no substance. Depending on what consciousness transforms, with deluded sentiment as condition, grasping arises. What deluded sentiment grasps are worldly self and dharmas. However, since the substance is non-existent, non-existence depends on existence. Depending on inner deluded sentiment, they are called self and dharmas").

2. **Using Meaning to Depend on Substance Provisional** (The commentary states: "The two kinds of self and dharmas explained in holy teachings depend on there being meanings of self and dharmas on the consciousness-substance. Meaning depends on substance, particular depends on general. Having substantial dharmas, objects are explained as self and dharmas").

The commentary states: "In these two explanations above, the first explanation says that although called self and dharmas, the substance is non-existent, following sentiment to speak provisionally. Even if substance exists, because it doesn't accord with the name, it is provisional. The two provisionals of self and dharmas belong to explanation - only taking verbal explanation as self and dharmas. That substance is entirely non-existent."

The *Yiyun* states: "Also, regarding the commentary's second explanation reaching 'meaning depends on substance' - saying 'using non-existence to depend on existence' means the grasped self and dharmas have no real substance, but the sentiment that grasps them is not non-existent in substance. Substanceless self and dharmas depend on deluded sentiment. Therefore it is called using non-existence to depend on existence."

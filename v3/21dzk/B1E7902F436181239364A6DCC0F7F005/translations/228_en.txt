*Xuanzan* fascicle 8 says: "The sūtra's ascetic practices (dhūta), commentary says: In Sanskrit it is called dhūta, meaning 'removal of the extraordinary.' Corrupted pronunciation gives 'toutuo.' There are these twelve. The *Yogācāra* Śrāvakabhūmi explains this." *Sheshan* fascicle 4 says: "Regarding the ascetic practice matters in the sūtras, both Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna Tripiṭaka fully clarify this meaning. Now, depending on the *Yogācāra*, I briefly raise two categories: 1. Distinguishing names and characteristics. 2. Antidotes. However, as a general name, it should be called dhūta. The correct explanation is as in the commentary. Also called 'washing and cleansing' because it washes and cleanses afflictions. One who washes clothes is called dhūta. Should be called dousu because it sifts dust. The meaning of washing is similar. Also called 'cultivating and treating the mind.' The twelve merits are bundled into three categories: 1. Clarifying food, having four types: regular begging for food, sequential begging for food, only one-seat eating, stopping first eating later. 2. Clarifying robes, having three types: holding three robes, woolen robes, rag robes, etc. 3. Clarifying places, having five types: quiet places, under trees in open places, charnel grounds for constant sitting, called

five places." 1. Regular begging for food means constantly making a vow to beg for food and sustain oneself. 2. Sequential begging for food means entering villages and respectfully going from house to house begging, receiving food as obtained, not raising hands high, not going beyond to other houses, not wishing "May I obtain exquisite food and drink." 3. One-seat eating means sitting in one dwelling, receiving all that should be eaten, and after rising from the seat, definitely not eating again. 4. Stopping first, eating later means for the sake of food, sitting as appropriate, before eating, first one should fully receive all that should be eaten. Correctly understand: "Now I only receive this much food and drink and should support myself. Beyond this I will not eat." Having thought thus, only then eat. 5. Holding only three robes means supporting oneself with only three robes: 1. Saṅghāṭī - this corresponds to the meaning of "being on top." When entering royal palaces and villages, it is worn on top, called "on top." 2. Uttarāsaṅga - also has the meaning of being worn on top. When in the monastery, namely the seven-strip robe. In the monastery, worn over the five-strip robe, also called "on top" or "middle position" - below the great robe, above the five-strip, hence called "middle." 3. Antarvāsa - called "inner robe." Antar means inner, vāsa means robe meaning. The lower antarvāsa covers the upper two places - a skillful abbreviation in the treatise. Excluding these three robes, there are no excess long robes. 6. Holding only woolen robes means the three robes held, whether regular or long robes, are all made using wool, with no other materials. Fine sheep wool is called wool. Wool woven into robes is called woolen robes. Or fine hair is called wool, extending to all birds and beasts. All fine wool is not only from sheep. 7. Holding rag robes means taking garments that others have discarded and thrown away, or from streets, markets, fields, roads and non-roads, or stained with various excrement, pus, blood, nasal mucus and saliva. Taking such impure clothing materials, removing dust and filth, firmly holding, washing and cleansing, sewing, dyeing, and maintaining. Question: Woolen garments and mixed materials also make three robes. What difference is there from the previous? Answer: The first three robes use good felt etc., not wool mixed materials. Fearing those who don't know contentment would use priceless felt etc. as robes, using wool mixtures as robes. Among these three sets of three, one randomly holds one set of three; it's not necessary to hold all three sets of three robes. 8. Dwelling in araṇya means dwelling in quiet places - dwelling in quiet mountains and forests, wilderness, using marginal bedding, distancing from all villages and settlements. Extremely poor bedding is called "marginal." Outside suburbs and forests is called wilderness. 9. Constantly residing under trees means constantly vowing to dwell under trees, depending on tree roots. 10. Constantly residing in remote places means constantly wishing to dwell in remote places without covering or obstacles. 11. Constantly dwelling in charnel grounds means constantly vowing to dwell in cemetery areas where those who have died are brought as corpses. 12. Regular sitting place as constant seat means at seats of large forests, small forests, grass and leaves, sitting upright facing the seat, calculating time and days, not leaning back or side against large forests. Small rope forest grass-leaf sitting is called "regular sitting." The various grass and leaf seats where one sits and lies, properly arranged for constant sitting and lying. After one arrangement, not frequently turning over and rearranging. Question: What do the twelve ascetic merits serve as antidotes for? Answer: The second antidote section, first general then specific. Question: What is called ascetic merit? Answer: Like wool etc., before being whipped, beaten, and carded, it clings together and is not soft, not suitable for making thread, yarn, and felt.

The *Sheśhì*, volume three, states that *Yogācārabhūmi*, volume 25, proclaims the uncommon supreme merits of buddhas, buddha disciples, monks, nuns, probationary nuns, male novices, female novices, laymen, and laywomen. The commentary explains that śikṣamāṇā means "proper learning"—learning to become a full nun. These seven groups seek nirvana by eliminating evil and cultivating good, but the merits they generate immediately lead to human and divine births, which is "common" like that of non-Buddhists. However, through this they ultimately attain transcendent nirvana, hence called "uncommon."

**Section 22: Clarifying the Five Signs of Decay for Heavenly Beings**

1. Flowers on the head wither; 2. Sweat flows from the armpits; 3. Light from the crown extinguishes; 4. Eyes blink frequently; 5. No longer enjoying one's seat.

*Xuanzan*, volume 6, states that when celestial beings are about to die, five signs appear: clothes become stained, flower garlands wither, sweat flows from both armpits, the body becomes foul-smelling, and celestial women and men no longer enjoy their seats. This applies only to desire realm heavens, excluding form and formless realms.

Beings in the desire realm experience three types of suffering: suffering of death and falling, suffering of contempt, and suffering of being cut, harmed, and expelled.

**Section 23: Clarifying the Tathāgata's Ten Types of Seats**

1. Wheel-turning king's seat (to bestow the ten virtues); 2. Four heavenly kings' seat (to exercise sovereignty over all Buddhist teachings in the world); 3. Indra's seat (to gain sovereignty over all sentient beings); 4. Brahmā king's seat (to gain sovereignty over one's own and others' minds); 5. Lion seat (to distinguish and expound profound meanings); 6. Dharma seat (to clarify dhāraṇīs, powers, and eloquence); 7. Firm samādhi seat (to perfect great bodhi); 8. Great compassion seat (to make all evil-minded beings rejoice); 9. Great loving-kindness seat (to endure all sufferings and afflictions); 10. Vajra seat (to subdue demons and non-Buddhists).

This is from *Xuanzan*, volume 7, quoting the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*.

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* phonetic commentary, volume 1, explains that regarding the lion seat, the *Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa* states: "The Buddha is a lion among humans. Wherever he sits, whether in forest or on ground, is called a lion seat—not an actual lion."

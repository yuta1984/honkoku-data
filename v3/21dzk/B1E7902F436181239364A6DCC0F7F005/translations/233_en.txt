路荼 (garuḍa). This means "wondrous wings." The feather colors are wondrous; they are not entirely golden. Kiṃnara - the correct Sanskrit is kiṃnara. This means "song spirits." Kiṃnara is a corruption. According to the dharma of one assembly taught by the Buddha, they appropriately sing. Just as worldly music sings the virtues of rulers. In Sanskrit it is mahoraga. This means "big belly" - types like large bees and mosquitoes that move with their bellies. Mahoraga is a corruption. (*Xuanzan* fascicle 2 can be consulted.) *Sheshaku* fascicle 2 says: The sūtra's kiṃnaras - some say they are song spirits with horse heads and human bodies who can speak. Question: Which realm do they belong to? According to *Abhidharmahṛdaya*, they belong to the animal realm. Regarding the sūtra's gandharvas, etc., also according to *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra*, gandharvas are called "child dragon spirits," meaning "tree dwellers." They dwell in the ten jeweled mountains on earth. When the gods need music, they manifest unusual characteristics and immediately fly up to heaven, taking turns with kiṃnaras going up and down. Question: Which realm do they belong to? Tradition has two explanations: one says they belong to the ghost realm, one says they belong to asuras. I haven't seen the authoritative text. The commentary's "lion's offspring" - this is also incorrect. It's not that because they are animals they are categorized as animals. Just as Vātsīputrīya, Kaukkuṭika sects, etc. are not categorized as animals, egg-born humans and their types are not singular. *Wengu* fascicle 2 says: Asuras means "no wine." They gather flowers from the four continents and brew them in the great ocean, but due to the karmic power of dragons and fish, the taste doesn't change. Due to anger, jealousy, and vowing to abstain, they are called "no-wine spirits." Also called "not upright." Master Mitian'an said: "zhiliang zhiliang" means direct faith. This spirit is deceptive and doesn't match its name. There are two types: those in the ghost realm mostly dwell by the great ocean's shore; those in the animal realm dwell at the bottom of the great ocean. *Renwang Commentary* says (composed by Ximing): However, the eight assemblies briefly have three types. First are the eight assemblies of devas, dragons, etc., as explained in various sūtras. Second, according to tradition, each of the four heavenly kings leads

two assemblies. Third, the eight assemblies, as explained in *Dīrghāgama* fascicle 3, there are eight assemblies in the world: 1) Kṣatriya assembly, 2) Brāhmaṇa assembly, 3) Householder assembly, 4) Śramaṇa assembly, 5) Heavenly king assembly, 6) Trāyastriṃśa heaven assembly, 7) Māra assembly, 8) Brahmā assembly. *Yogācāra-bhūmi* commentary says "eight assembly gatherings." The so-called eight assemblies are largely the same as *Āgama*, *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra*, etc. Question: Why do humans and devas each explain four assemblies? Answer: As explained in *Yogācāra-bhūmi* fascicle 15, due to seven causes, eight assemblies are established. Therefore that treatise says: Due to four causes, four assemblies are established in the human realm; due to three causes, four assemblies are established in the deva realm. Because they are most superior, universally acknowledged by the world as fields of merit, using resources without depending on others, abandoning all worldly resources. Due to these four causes, four assemblies are established in the human realm. Depending on geographical boundaries, desire realm boundaries, verbal action boundaries - due to these three causes, four assemblies are established in the deva realm. If following *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* fascicle 10, explaining the reasons separately would be too lengthy to describe. (*Yogācāra-bhūmi* fascicle 15 can be consulted.) Question: What are "humans and non-humans"? Answer: This collectively refers to the four assemblies and eight assemblies as "humans, etc." The four assemblies are called "humans," the eight assemblies are called "non-humans." Therefore *Xuanzan* fascicle 2 says: Regarding the sūtra passage "At that time Śakra together with twenty thousand devas" - Commentary says: Above clarifies the inner protection of five assemblies (noble assemblies, non-noble assemblies, retinue assemblies, venerable assemblies, assemblies of inconceivable holy virtue), this clarifies the outer protection of ten types (Śakra and various deva assemblies, etc.). Among these, humans and non-humans make two; among non-humans, devas and non-devas make two; among devas, desire and form realms make two, etc. Based on this understanding, the four assemblies of monks, etc. are called "humans," the eight assemblies of devas, etc. are called "non-humans." *Anantanirdeśa-sūtra Commentary* upper fascicle says:

**Left Page**

(Composed by Master Wontchuk) If following the *Lotus Sūtra*, it also says "humans and non-humans" - why doesn't this sūtra mention "humans and non-humans"? Explanation: Because various spirits take human form, they are called "human non-humans." Another explanation: "humans" concludes the human realm; "non-humans" concludes non-human realms. They are not explained separately. *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Zhenxing Phonetic Commentary* fascicle 2 says: Regarding yakṣas, Cien says: In Tang they are called "brave and strong movers." They can scatter and harm. *Wengu* calls them "swift illness ghosts." Formerly called yakṣas. *Wengu* fascicle 2 says: Next it lists four kiṃnaras. Also called "doubt spirits." They resemble humans but have one horn, therefore called "human non-humans." They are the Heavenly Emperor's dharma music spirits. They dwell in the ten jeweled mountains; when their bodies show unusual characteristics, they immediately ascend to perform music. When the Buddha teaches dharma, various great string songs and pañcavaṃśa lutes praise the dharma gates. Gandharvas means "fragrant odor." They eat fragrances, also called "fragrance shadows." Their bodies emit fragrance. These are the Heavenly Emperor's worldly music spirits. *Bhaiṣajyaguru-sūtra Shenzhu Commentary* says: Regarding the sūtra passage "with the great bhikṣu assembly... (up to) devas, dragons, yakṣas, humans, non-humans and countless great assemblies" - from here down, the third section clarifies the congregations who are the basis for raising teachings. According to the Sui translation and this "carrying out" section, there are altogether seventeen assemblies... 9) Yakṣa assembly, 15) Human assembly, 16) Non-human assembly, 17) Rākṣasa assembly... Non-humans refer to ghosts, etc. Also called yakṣas, also called yakṣas. In Tang called "fearsome" or "powerful." *Lotus Sūtra Dhāraṇī Chapter Phonetic Commentary* says: Rākṣasas (rākṣasas mean "violent and evil").

**Chapter 11: Eight Divisions of Prajñā** (There are two types)

1. Large Prajñā, 2. Small Prajñā, 3. Mañjuśrī Prajñā, 4. Vajra

**Lower Section**

Prajñā, 5. Guangzan Prajñā, 6. Daoxing Prajñā, 7. Shengtian Prajñā, 8. Renwang Prajñā.

Also eight divisions: 1. One hundred thousand verse division, 2. Twenty-five thousand verse division (these two divisions don't exist in this region), 3. Eighteen thousand verse division (this is the Large Prajñā), 4. Eight thousand verse division (this is the Small Prajñā), 5. Four thousand verse division (doesn't exist in this region), 6. Two thousand five hundred verse division (this is the Heavenly King's Questions Prajñā), 7. Six hundred verse division (this is Mañjuśrī's Questions), 8. Three hundred verse division (this is the Vajra Prajñā).

*Renwang-jing Commentary* upper fascicle says (Ximing): Saying "previously already for us, etc." refers to previous events. Previously already for us and the great assembly, in the twenty-ninth year after initial enlightenment, four Prajñās were taught: 1. Mahāprajñā, 2. Vajra Prajñā, 3. Heavenly King's Questions Prajñā, 4. Guangzan Prajñā. Explanation: The original record says that according to this sūtra it should constitute five divisions. According to old traditions, there are two types of eight divisions. First are the eight divisions circulating in this land as above. Second, according to Bodhiruci's *Vajra Immortal Treatise*, eight divisions (as above). According to Paramārtha's *Vajra Prajñā Record*, the eight Prajñā divisions are also the same as Bodhiruci's. The difference is that the sixth division is also said not to exist in this region. Now questioning, Rizhao Tripitaka and Khotan Tripitaka both make this explanation, but in those places they haven't heard the name of eight divisions. Now according to the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā*, there are four locations and sixteen assemblies but they don't include Renwang Prajñā. Also Master Cien says the West is not limited to eight divisions. Question: According to *Mahāprajñāpāramitā*, among the sixteen assemblies, Mahāprajñā is the second assembly, Vajra Prajñā is the ninth assembly, Heavenly King's Questions is the sixth assembly, Guangzan is also the second assembly. How can this be?

1. Characteristics (lakṣaṇa) - encompasses both contaminated and uncontaminated; 2. Names (nāma); 3. Discrimination (vikalpa) - the above two types are contaminated only; 4. Suchness (tathatā); 5. Correct cognition (samyag-jñāna) - the above two types are uncontaminated only.

Explaining "characteristics": In brief, they are the foundation upon which all verbal expressions depend. "Names" refer to what depends on linguistic expressions among the various characteristics. "Discrimination" refers to all mind and mental factors included in the three realms. "Suchness" refers to what is revealed by the selflessness of phenomena, the object of noble wisdom, and that upon which no verbal expressions depend. "Correct cognition" briefly has two types: 1) purely supramundane, and 2) mundane-supramundane. Purely supramundane correct cognition is the penetration of suchness by the Two Vehicles and bodhisattvas. Mundane-supramundane correct cognition refers to the subsequently attained mundane-supramundane correct cognition after the Two Vehicles initially penetrate suchness. For bodhisattvas alone, initial correct cognition attains purification of cognitive obscurations, while subsequent correct cognition attains purification of afflictive obscurations. For the Two Vehicles' two correct cognitions, both attain only purification of afflictive obscurations. See the *Abhidharmasaṃuccaya* Volume 6. The *Private Notes on Vijñāpti-mātra Doctrine* Volume 4 states: Question: What are the essences of characteristics, names, etc.? Answer: Mind and mental factors manifesting in resemblance to what they signify become characteristics; what can signify becomes names; the transforming minds etc. become discrimination; uncontaminated minds etc. become correct cognition; the principle of emptiness becomes suchness. (There are many explanations, as in Volume 8 of the *Vijñāpti-mātra-vijñāna* citing the intent of the *Abhidharmasaṃuccaya*.)

There are two types of five phenomena: 1) Five phenomena with essence (this is fundamental, excluding the imagined nature), 2) Five phenomena without essence (encompassing the three natures).

Another explanation states: "Characteristics" encompass the individual and common characteristics of all contaminated and uncontaminated phenomena. "Names" can designate and reveal meanings and essential natures. "Discrimination" has the function of cognizing and comprehensively grasping. These two are contaminated only. "Correct cognition" is free from false inversions.

Mental application in accordance with principle. "Suchness" is the meaning of the object of true wisdom, called "uncontaminated reality," like permanent phenomena. It is not the meaning of the characteristics of the extinction of contaminations. "Correct cognition" has the meaning of counteracting the extinction of contaminations, hence called "uncontaminated." (See *Vijñāpti-mātra Commentary* Volume 9, citing *Yogācārabhūmi* 72, also see 74.)

Question: How do the three natures and five phenomena mutually encompass each other? *Treatise* Volume 8 states: The mutual encompassing explained in various sacred teachings is not fixed. Some places explain that the dependent nature encompasses characteristics, names, discrimination, and correct cognition; the perfectly accomplished nature encompasses suchness; the imagined nature does not encompass the five phenomena. This explains that contaminated mind and mental factors manifesting in resemblance to what they signify are called characteristics; appearing in resemblance to what can signify is established as names; the transforming minds etc. are established as discrimination; uncontaminated minds etc., being free from conceptual proliferation, are simply called correct cognition in general, without explaining signifier and signified. The four arise from conditions and are all encompassed by the dependent nature... The texts explaining the five phenomena in various sacred teachings differ in wording but not in meaning. However, what was explained initially does not involve confusion and contradiction. This should be understood as extensively explained in the *Yogācārabhūmi*. (The initial explanation is from *Yogācārabhūmi* 74, *Abhidharmasaṃuccaya* Volumes 6 and 16. Thus there are four different explanations of the three natures and five phenomena. Among them, the initial explanation is good. "No contradiction in meaning" means each of the four explanations is based on one particular aspect. For details, see *Treatise* Volume 8 commentary.) The *Madhyāntavibhāga* verse states: "Names are the imagined nature; characteristics and discrimination are dependent; suchness and correct cognition are revealed by the perfectly accomplished."

**Eighth Section: Five Levels of Consciousness-Only**
1. Eliminating the False and Preserving the Real Consciousness: When yogis cultivating consciousness-only contemplation observe objects, they contrast the three natures, eliminate the imagined nature, and preserve the dependent and perfectly accomplished natures as real. These two preserved natures are called "consciousness-only." The chapter states: "First, eliminating the false and preserving the real consciousness. Observing that the imagined nature arises only falsely, having no essence or function... one should correctly preserve existence, as principle exists while subjectivity does not." There are two textual proofs: Asaṅga's

**Upper Section**
*Abhidharmasaṃuccaya* root verses and the *Vijñāpti-mātra Treatise*. This first level applies this contemplation throughout both ordinary and noble stages. Hence the chapter states: "The consciousness-only contemplated in this first approach is contemplated, cultivated, and realized at all stages." Private notes state: The chapter's text "this first approach... contemplated, cultivated, and realized at all stages" clarifies the scope of stages for cultivating the contemplation of eliminating false and preserving real. Namely, this first contemplation involves contemplation at the pre-ground stages, cultivation at the ground stages, and realization at the ultimate stage. Although there is also cultivation wisdom at the preparatory stage within the pre-ground stages, due to its brief duration, cultivation is not mentioned. Although there is realization in the path of seeing, since it is not yet complete, it is not mentioned. It also states: The provisions stage has only contemplation, without cultivation or realization. The preparatory stage has cultivation. The paths of seeing and cultivation have only cultivation and realization. The Buddha stage has only realization. Question: If this first approach to consciousness-only contemplation can be contemplated at the five stages, why does the *Diamond Sutra Commentary* state: "At the ten abodes and ten practices stages, one makes consciousness-only contemplation based on the causal conditions approach; at the ten dedications stage, one makes signless contemplation based on the consciousness-only approach; at the four good roots stage, one makes suchness contemplation based on the signless approach"? Answer: This concerns matching the four contemplation approaches with stages. Cultivating consciousness-only contemplation has both general and specific cultivation. Saying "making consciousness-only contemplation at the ten abodes and ten practices stages" refers to specific cultivation characteristics. Saying "at all stages" refers to general cultivation. Hence there is no contradiction, just as contemplation of the factors of enlightenment has both general and specific cultivation.

2. Abandoning the Ambiguous and Retaining the Pure Consciousness: Regarding the two preserved natures, although both principle and phenomena are called "consciousness-only," within inner consciousness, when mind and objects are contrasted, since objects encompass both inner and outer and thus involve ambiguity, one abandons calling it "object-only." Since mind is purely inner,

**Lower Section**
it is retained and called "consciousness-only." The chapter states: "Although observing phenomena and principle as not separate from consciousness, this inner consciousness has both objects and mind. Since mind necessarily arises by depending on inner objects, one speaks only of consciousness, not of 'object-only'... Due to the ambiguity of objects, they are abandoned and not called 'only'; since the mind's essence is already pure, it is retained and called 'consciousness-only.'" There are four textual proofs: *Vijñāpti-mātra Treatise*, *Ghanavyūha Sūtra*, *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, and *Testament Sutra*.

3. Gathering Branches to the Root Consciousness: Regarding pure inner mind, when contrasting root and branches, one gathers the branches of seeing and characteristics aspects to return to the root of self-essence. The self-essence aspect is called "consciousness-only." The chapter states: "These seeing and characteristics aspects both exist depending on consciousness. Without the self-essence root, the branch phenomena necessarily do not exist... gathering the branches of characteristics and seeing to return to the root of consciousness." There are three textual proofs: *Thirty Verses*, *Vijñāpti-mātra Treatise*, and *Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra*.

4. Concealing the Inferior and Revealing the Superior Consciousness: Regarding the root self-essence aspect, when contrasting superior and inferior, since mind-kings are the supporting masters and are superior while mental factors are supported and inferior, one conceals the inferior mental factors and reveals the superior mind-kings, calling this "consciousness-only." The chapter states: "Mind and mental factors both can transform and manifest, but one speaks of 'mind-only,' not 'mental-factors-only.' Mind-kings have excellent essence; mental factors are inferior and arise depending on the superior. The inferior is concealed and not manifested; only the superior phenomena are revealed." There are two textual proofs: *Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra* and *Vimalakīrti Sūtra*.

5. Eliminating Characteristics and Realizing Nature Consciousness: Regarding superior mind-kings, when contrasting principle and phenomena, one eliminates phenomenal characteristics and functions without grasping them. Taking principle as essential nature and seeking realization, one takes true principle and calls it "consciousness-only." The chapter states: "What the term 'consciousness' expresses includes both principle and phenomena. Phenomena as characteristics and functions are eliminated and not grasped; principle as essential nature should be sought for realization." There are two textual proofs: *Śrīmālādevī Sūtra* and *Abhidharmasaṃuccaya*.

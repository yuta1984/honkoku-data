Like sores and blisters. Hence the name.

Second is Nirarbuda Hell.
This means "burst blisters." Like blisters that burst with pus and blood flowing out, with sores shriveling up. Hence the name.
The above names are established according to bodily forms. The lifespan is like one Brahmā period - one hundred years to eliminate one completely, with subsequent ones being twenty times longer.

Third is Ahahava Hell.
Fourth is Hahava Hell.
Fifth is Huhuva Hell.
These three hells represent distinctions in the sounds of suffering sentient beings. Therefore names are established according to sounds. Namely, sounds of enduring cold.

Sixth is Utpala Hell.
This means "blue lotus." Due to being oppressed by extremely severe and vast cold contact, all body parts become blue with stagnant blood, and skin splits into five or six pieces. Names are established according to body color.

Seventh is Padma Hell.
This means "red lotus." After passing beyond the blue color, the color changes to red. Skin splits into ten or more pieces. This name is established according to body color.

Eighth is Mahāpadma Hell.

【Page 6 Lower】
This means "great red lotus." Their body parts become extremely deep red. Skin splits into one hundred or more pieces. Names are also established according to color. Both the eight hot and eight cold hells exist only beneath the southern Jambudvīpa continent. The other three continents do not have them. Why? Because only the people of Jambudvīpa are vigorous in both creating good and creating evil, unlike the other continents. However, the other three continents have neighboring and solitary [hells]. According to one interpretation, the small continents have no neighboring or solitary hells because they are places for receiving purely good karmic results.

　　The above can be seen in Xuanzan Volume 6, Sections and Commentaries Volume 3, and the Five Destinies in Volume 11, which explain this in detail. Xuanzan Volume 6 should especially be consulted.

　　　　Second is the Hungry Ghost Realm.
They depend on others to seek food, are constantly not free, hungry, often timid and fearful. Therefore they are called hungry ghosts. There are three types: first, external obstacles that hinder food and drink; second, internal obstacles that hinder food and drink; third, no obstacles to food and drink. External means constantly not obtaining food and drink, lips dry and parched, licking the mouth and face with the tongue, suffering from hunger and thirst. Internal means the throat is extremely thin like a needle while the belly is vast. Even if they obtain food and drink, they dare not be able to consume it. Even without interference from others, they cannot consume it this way. Having no obstacles means even if they obtain food and drink and consume it, as soon as they use it, it becomes food that burns them. Thus their types are not the same. They are mainly based in Yama's kingdom, and also dwell beside mountains, fields, rivers, and seas. Abhidharmakośa Verse Commentary Volume 11 states: "The original dwelling of various ghosts is Yama's kingdom. Below this Jambudvīpa continent, passing five hundred yojanas, there is

【Page 7 Upper】
Yama's kingdom, also measuring the same in length and width. From there they gradually scatter and dwell in other places. Some are dignified and possess great威德, receiving various riches and pleasures, free like heaven. Some are hungry and weak with ugly countenances. Such are these types, as extensively explained in the sutras." The Commentary on the Amitābha Sutra, Lower Volume states: "The three evil destinies are hell, hungry ghosts, and animals. Hell: in Sanskrit called Naraka, meaning 'vessel of suffering' - the vessel-like place where suffering beings dwell. Hungry ghosts: having many fears and long receiving hunger and thirst. Animals: sometimes pronounced 'chuliu fan' or 'xiliu fan' because humans raise them. Or called 'pang sheng' (side-born) because their karma-creating is sideways, so their retribution is also sideways." The contrasting pronunciations of the character 'chu' are particularly noteworthy. Or called animals: 'chu' means the resources for nurturing and raising. Because they are beings raised by humans, they are called animals. The Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna Sūtra states: "Animals, wild beasts, and insects combined make three categories, totaling about 3.4 billion types." This is cited in Zenzhu's Commentary on the Medicine Buddha Sutra.

　　　　　Third is the Animal Realm
Also called "side-born" because they walk beside humans. Their dwellings are mostly in water, land, and sky. Their original place is the great ocean. They also gradually scatter to dwell in other places, namely mountains, forests, rivers, and marshes. Animals have three types: birds, beasts, and insects, totaling about 3.4 billion species. Among the three types. Lifespan is at most one intermediate kalpa. Others are indefinite. The two pronunciations 'chou jiu xu jiu' and 'xu yu chou liu' all mean 'gather,' not this meaning. Or animals: 'chu' means the meaning of nurturing and raising. As human resources, beings raised by

【Page 7 Lower】
humans. Therefore called animals. The two tones gong and yu manifest this meaning. This is the interpretation from Lotus Sound Glosses. Matsumuro's commentary thus cites the sound glosses. The Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna Sūtra explains: "There are 3.4 billion animals." This is cited in the Medicine Buddha Sutra Commentary composed by Master Zenzhu.

　　　　Fourth is the Human Realm
The Nirvana Sutra states: "Because of much thinking, they are called humans." Sections and Commentaries states: "Either creating thought or creating kindness - following the character there are two meanings. First is thought: skillfully contemplating various good and evil, different from other realms. Second is kindness: having virtues of kindness and compassion, superior to other realms. The original sutra text should be examined." Also, the Abhidharmahṛdaya states: "Because of tranquility, they are called humans." Sections and Commentaries Volume 2 states: "Two interpretations: first, taking the principle of nirvana as tranquility. Second, humans mostly lack severe sufferings and disturbances, unlike ghosts and others who have many fears and extreme great sufferings, therefore called tranquil. In my opinion, the latter interpretation is good." They dwell in four continents, pointing to the four directions: east, south, west, and north.

First is Eastern Pūrvavideha.
This means "Superior Body Continent," namely Videha continent. Because their bodily forms are superior. Or taking the southern form, they gain the name "superior." Or translated as "front" because they are in front of the other directions.

Second is Southern Jambudvīpa.
This is called Jambunada. This is the name of a tree. This continent has a pool called Anavatapta (Cool Pool). On the north shore of that pool is a tree called the Jambu tree. Below this tree is gold of the finest quality.

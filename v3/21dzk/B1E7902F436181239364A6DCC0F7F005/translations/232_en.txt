Courageous diligence means constantly delighting in listening to dharma not yet heard, causing already heard dharma to become clear and pure, not abandoning yoga, not abandoning mental application, and not abandoning inner śamatha. Nine is being without weariness - namely proclaiming wonderful dharma extensively for the four assemblies without bodily or mental fatigue. Ten is being endowed with patient strength - namely when reviled, mocked, or criticized, never retaliating, and when despised, not harboring anger or resentment... (extensively explained). This can be seen in *Yogācāra-bhūmi* fascicle 82. *Xuanzan* fascicle 8 (Dharma Teacher chapter section).

According to the *Daśabhūmika-vibhāṣā*, there are four dharmas for teaching dharma while occupying the lion throne: First, one should first respectfully bow to the great assembly before ascending the seat. Second, if there are women in the assembly, one should contemplate impurity. Third, having dignified deportment with the characteristics of a great person, pleasant countenance that inspires trust in all, not teaching heretical texts, with mind free from timidity. Fourth, practicing patience even toward harsh words and challenging questions. There are also four more dharmas: First, not belittling oneself. Second, not belittling listeners. Third, [regarding] what is taught (possible missing characters). Fourth, not [teaching] for profit and offerings. In *Abhidharmāśāstra*, *Prakaraṇa*, *Yogācāra-bhūmi*, etc., there are all questions about challenging questions, dharma teaching characteristics, etc. One should extensively follow those examples.

**Chapter 7: Clarifying the Ten Virtues of Dharma Listeners**

1. Respectfully listening to dharma enables direct realization and obtains beneficial peace. 2. Well establishing all dharmas, departing from various faults, possessing great meaning, or the efforts set forth by speaker and listener having excellent results. 3. Enabling sentient beings to abandon evil destinies, obtain good destinies, and swiftly attract and gather the causes of nirvana. These three matters can only be obtained through respectful listening. 4. Being able to well understand sūtras, etc. Such correct dharma enables sentient beings to abandon all unwholesomeness and embrace all wholesomeness. If good listeners receive

and abandon accordingly. Through this abandoning and receiving, they abandon future suffering attracted by evil causes and swiftly realize nirvana. 5. I should now hear what I have not yet heard, after hearing research thoroughly, should sever the net of doubts, abandon and reject various views. I should use wisdom to penetrate all profound meanings and passages. This reveals the three wisdoms: the first two reveal hearing, the next two reveal contemplation, the last one reveals cultivation. 6. Wishing to respectfully repay the Teacher's kindness and virtue. The Buddha performed countless difficult practices and ascetic practices for my sake, seeking to obtain this dharma - how could I now not listen? Observing one's own meaningful principles, ultimately able to depart from all burning afflictions, well according with correct standards, easy to see and understand, wise ones internally realize the knowable. 7. I should gather the seven types of correct dharma, know meanings up to extensively explaining distinctions of high and low status. 8. Buddha-dharma is easy to obtain - even demonstrating clearly for caṇḍālas, etc., so it's easy to learn. Since it can be cultivated in walking, standing, sitting, lying down, it can attract superior results and definite excellent results. Good in the beginning, middle, and end, it produces present pleasant results and attracts future results. 9. Liberation from five kinds of worldly oppressive matters: First, able to escape the great prison of birth and death. Second, permanently severing the firm bonds of greed, etc. Third, abandoning the poverty of seven treasures and establishing wealth of seven treasures. Fourth, transcending the restrictions of good conduct and hearing correct dharma, establishing abundance in good conduct and hearing correct dharma. Seven, ultimately able to cure the illness of afflictions. Eight, liberation from all bonds of greedy attachment. Nine, able to cross the vast wilderness and dense forest journey of beginningless birth and death. Ten, respectfully listening to dharma and gaining discerning power. Through this one can receive the excellent benefits of hearing dharma, seek wealth according to dharma without using non-dharmic means, deeply seeing faults and disadvantages while receiving and using them. Up to the tenth, being able to attract all mundane and supramundane meditations, liberations, concentrations, and attainments. Extensively

as explained there. Speakers and listeners should first dwell in superior dharma before being able to speak and listen. If not dwelling in this, setting forth efforts in vain will ultimately have no great results. (This is the intent of the *Adhyāśayasañcodana Commentary*.)

*Adhyāśayasañcodana Commentary*, upper fascicle, says: Those dharma listeners, when the dharma teacher is teaching correct dharma, should settle others, cause them to dwell in reverence, and listen without distortion. Through one cause or up to ten...

**Chapter 8: Four Virtues of a Physician** (*Xuanzan* fascicle 9 can be consulted. Eight arts appended.)

1. Recognizing disease substance. 2. Recognizing disease causes. 3. Recognizing disease not yet arisen. 4. Recognizing arising after cessation.

The same eight arts are:

1. Treating needle puncture wounds. 2. Treating traumatic injuries. 3. Treating bodily diseases (namely the previous four: wind conditions, genital diseases, comprehensive treatment). 4. Demonic types. 5. Poisoning. 6. Treating children. 7. Extending life. 8. Nourishing strength.

*Golden Light* fascicle 9 says: Namely needle punctures, traumatic wounds, bodily diseases together with demons and spirits, evil poisons and children, extending years and increasing vitality. *Golden Light Commentary* fascicle 6 can be consulted. The same sūtra's Disease Elimination chapter says: First arouse compassionate minds, do not seek financial profit. (One should especially dwell in this intention.)

**Chapter 9: Four Assemblies** (*Xuanzan* fascicle 2 can be consulted.)

1. Monks. 2. Nuns. 3. Male lay practitioners. 4. Female lay practitioners.

The correct Sanskrit pronunciation is upāsaka, upāsikā. Upa means "near," ka means "serve." Sa is the masculine ending, si is the feminine ending. Since men and women who have accomplished precepts are suitable to approach closely and serve the communities of monks

**Lower Section**

and nuns, they are called "near-serving men" and "near-serving women." The ancient terms upāsaka and upāsikā, named "pure faithful men" and "pure faithful women," are corruptions. Adding novices, female novices, and probationary nuns makes the "seven assemblies." (Details are as in the above sixty-two sentient beings section.)

**Chapter 10: Eight Assemblies** (Ximing's *Renwang Commentary* can be consulted.)

1. Devas. 2. Dragons. 3. Yakṣas. 4. Gandharvas. 5. Asuras. 6. Garuḍas. 7. Kiṃnaras. 8. Mahoragas.

The explanation says: Devas are the various divine assemblies of the desire and form realms. (The meaning of deva is as clarified in the above six destinies section.) Dragons belong to the animal destiny - dragon kings like Nanda. Yakṣas means "brave and strong." They fly through empty space and include terrestrial rākṣasas among earthbound types. Rākṣasa means "different and evil," also "fearsome." These are all corrupted words. The correct Sanskrit is yakṣa-rākṣasa. (Ghost destiny.) Gandharvas means "seeking fragrance walkers" - namely music-making spirits. Gandharva is a corruption. In the Western Regions, they call entertainers gandharvas because of this, as they specialize in seeking fragrances and making music to beg. Asura is a corruption. Correctly it is asura. This means "non-deva." Sura is another name for deva, a means "non." Because they have much deception and lack divine conduct, they are called "non-devas," just as unbenevolent people are also called "non-humans." *Yogācāra-bhūmi* and *Buddha-bhūmi Treatise* consider them the deva destiny. *Abhidharmahṛdaya* considers them the ghost destiny. *Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna Sūtra* considers them ghost and animal destinies. *Gāthā Sūtra* speaks of ghost, animal, and deva three destinies. Some say Rāhu-asura is a lion's offspring, included in animals. Now following *Mahāyāna Yogācāra* as correct. Garuḍa - the ancients translated as "golden-winged bird," all corruptions. The correct Sanskrit pronunciation is ga-

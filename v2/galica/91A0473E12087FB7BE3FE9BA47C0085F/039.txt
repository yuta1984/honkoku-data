立華正道集
"The right way  of planting flowers"
This work seems to  reveal the arts of 
planting flowes in such a way as 
to discover secrets and foretel【foretell】future
events by their growths.  Three of
these four volumes are full of
graphical descriptions of the sin-
gular growth of these  flowers, whi-
le the fourth volume points how
they are to be  managed so as to pro-
duce these effects.

62 You say true.
63 What do you think of it?
Already this new moon is nearly half over.
Within two or three days the  Banjoos(?) are
to come upon the Island, to inspect every thing
for the voyage.
64 I beleive【believe】 so too.
We are【不要】  know beforehand that we are very busy every year 
before the voyage begins, particularly the
first year, when the time for  making the
preparation for the voyage draws  near.
65 I wish the weather may be clear and fair the
fifteenth of this month - we must go to Sak-
roebaba there to take leave of all the travellers.
 66 I wish also the weather may be fair
as far as Kokera
for it is extremely unpleasant with bad weather
and a muddy road, as last year.
 67 I have detained you long
and fear I have tired you.
I will go home
and will  come on another day to take leave of 
you.
68 I will do the same sir.
69 I fancy during our voyage you will be
constantly amusing yourself with your friends
the whole spring.
70  Yes, one may spend  every spring
an【a】great deal of money in different parties of  pleas ■【pleasureヵ】

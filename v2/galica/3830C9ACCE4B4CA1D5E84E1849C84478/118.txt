and told me
the arrival of the new Governor will  entire■【entirelyヵ】
change Nagasaki & will make  it as flourishing
as it was formerly.
7 't is good  news, but he has deceived you.
8 No: he is a honest  man.
When he has promised you any thing , the ■
is not dubious, he is  always very polite.
9  I beleive 【believe】it is true, but what proofs has he for what he advances?
10 I do'nt know the particulars
I have heard the reason was because Nagasa-
ki decays from day to day.
11 It is not certain, for Nagasaki is a princi-
 pal Imperial domain, thus, if the Governor
does not obtain the  consent of the Emperor,
he can not do what he likes.
12  True, but the Governors do not need
any new arguments to convince  them that if many Dutch
ships & Chinese vessels come into the Bay Nagasaki will soon flourish as much as
formerly.
13 Why did no more Chinese junks arrive?
14  Do'nt you know the reason?
15 No, tell me the reason, I will not speak of  it.
16 You must not speak a word of it  & I wil tell you
the reason.

 　　with another friend.
33 Welcome my good friend.
34  I have heard from N.  you are to go to day
with him to the play.
35 Yes, but it is not yet certain.
36 Why so?
37 He goes to day to Decima.
38  You are joking.
39 No, I tell you the truth.
40 Who told you so?
41 He told me so himself.
42 Has he been with you.
43 Yes, this instant.
44 Is he gone already to Decima?
45 No, he is at present with N, to beg him to fill
his place.
46 Does he come  back?
47  Yes, will you stay till he returns?
 48 Yes, but I will go with you if he does not.
49  At all events you may go with  us, as I wish
to be three.
50  If you please.
51 Ha! you return soon, what has he told you?
52 He can not go.
53 Why so?
54  He was there yesterday, moreover he feels
himself to day a little indispos'd.
55 I am sorry for it, I will go then to morrow.
56 If you can, you will oblige me.
57 But then you must not fail again to morrow.【2のthenは削除ヵ】

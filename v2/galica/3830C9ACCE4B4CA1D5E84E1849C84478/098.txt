11 No, it is a long time  since I have been anywhere.
12 I went into the fields yesterday to seek
mushrooms, and  I was much amused.
13 You was【were】much amused, but 
did you fond【find】any mushrooms?
 14 No, none at all, they are too far off in the wood.
15  I think they are  too scarce yet.
16 You are right
 17  I learned yesterday from N.  that your mother has
been  indisposed lately, is she recovered?
18 Yes, she is better, but does not  yet leave the bed.
19 I beg you pardon I have not been to see her,
what is her complaint?
20 She has  a pleurisy.
 21 I too have had a pleurisy ten days ago. 
It is for that that I  have had recourse to the bur-
ning of moxa.
22 Yes, the burning of moxa is the best remedy
for curing the pleurizy【pleurisy】.
23 It is so, but do'nt you like to  drink Saki?
24 If you please,  but I am extremely asha 
 m'd you
entertain me so often.
25 You are too polite.
 　　Between Master and his servant
  　　Come here.
　　What do you wish?
　　Bring Saki & some sweetmeats.
　　As you desire.

  Having whippsd the Morth of its own cruel game, Michael Whalen is

Muir, are secking a gold mine inheritance in the Klondike ..ilds.【脱字？】  Whalen
finally agrees to guide lieck tothe mine but forces Jean Muir to retuen to
civiliza.ion.【脱字？】
  On the trail the Arctic winter closes in and Beck goes mad.  He falls
over a cliff after shooting himself. Whalen too, succumbs his last conscious
monent being when he sees a huge white wolf standing over him, Strangely, 
the white wolf makes no attempt to kill him and flees when Indians rescue
Whalen.
  In the remote settlement, Whalen recovers under the care of Jane
Darwell and Charles Winningers, a helf-drunken old doctor.  From papers
in Whalen's clothes, they think he is Beck.  Cynically deciding he might
as well have the gold whalen takes over the mine under Beck's identity,
from Aohn Carradine, local thug who had stolen it.
  One day Whalen stops as pit fight between a bulldog and a captured
"white wolf."  He recognizes the wolf as the legendary white Fang who
had stood over him on the trail.  He begins patiently tame the wild beast.
  When Spring comes, Carradine hints that the new miners coming in
will recognize Whalen.  Whalen gets ready to vanish with his takings.
Then Joan Muir returns, and Whalen s exposed.  He admits everything,
but says Beck died of pneumonia, rather than shock the girl with her
brother's suicide.
  Jean Muir decides Whalen is right.  She likes this outspoken he-man
and she needs his help.  Then the old doc finds Beck's body, a bullet hole
through the head.  He also finds a diary revealing the boy's suicidal intent,
but drunkenly loses it.  Carradine accuses Whalen of murder, and with his 
gang succeeds in jailing him.  Then White Fang comes to the rescue!  The
savage wolf-dog attacks the guards and Whalen escapes.  But again he is
caught, and hustled to a quick hanging party.
  Meanwhile, the doc and Jean Muir search frantically for the dirty,
which is located at last.  White Fang leads the rescue party to the hang-
ing in hte deep woods, where in a knock-down freefer all Whalen is freed,
with Jean Muir's arms hoding him closefor good.
